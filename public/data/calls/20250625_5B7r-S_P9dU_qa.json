      "asker": "implicit",
      "answer": "On Ergo, blocks are mined approximately every two minutes. The maximum size of an Ergo block is two megabytes, which determines how many transactions can fit in each block.",

      "asker": "implicit",
      "answer": "The total reward consists of two parts: the block subsidy (which is currently about 15 ERG at this point in time) and transaction fees from all transactions included in the block. Currently, transaction fees don't amount to much for miners, but they're part of the total reward.",

      "asker": "implicit",
      "answer": "The mempool shows transactions that people have submitted that are yet to be put into the blockchain or on the ledger. These transactions are sort of in limbo until they get picked up by miners and included in a block.",

      "asker": "implicit",
      "answer": "The application uses Nautilus wallet integration through the dApp connector. You can connect your wallet to interact with the blockchain, create and sign transactions directly from the web application. The integration allows you to send test transactions and donations while visualizing them in the mempool.",

The Ergo documentation provides APIs for blockchain data, and there are examples showing UTXO handling and transaction building.",
