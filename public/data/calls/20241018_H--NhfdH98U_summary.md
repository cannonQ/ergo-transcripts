# Ergo PoW Blockchain Community Call Summary
**Date:** October 18, 2024
**Call Title:** Ergo PoW Blockchain - Weekly Update & AMA - October 17th 2024

## Executive Summary

This community call provided significant updates on Ergo's technical development and ecosystem growth. The most notable announcement was kushti's progress on Ergo 6.0, which is nearing completion with core features ready and successful testing of adjustable sub-blocks parameters through a "super soft" fork mechanism. The discussion emphasized Ergo's commitment to evolutionary rather than disruptive protocol updates, drawing from lessons learned from other blockchain communities that experienced damaging splits due to contentious hard forks.

The call also highlighted growing ecosystem participation, with successful launches like MewFinance's Mew5 token sale, expanding mining pool operations with storage rent collection, and the near-completion of Rosen Bridge's ETH integration. There was a strong emphasis on the need for active community participation in DAOs, voting, and ecosystem building to create a thriving local economy within Ergo's global network.
