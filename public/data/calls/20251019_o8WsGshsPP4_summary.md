# Ergo Community Call Summary
**Date:** October 19, 2025  
**Topic:** Why Mine Ergo: Profitability, Sustainability & the Sigmanauts Mining Pool

## Executive Summary

Marc the Shark led a comprehensive presentation on Ergo mining, covering everything from basic concepts to advanced technical considerations. The session emphasized Ergo's fair launch principles (no pre-mine, no ICO, no VC funding), its ASIC-resistant Autolykos algorithm, and the technical aspects of setting up profitable mining operations. A significant focus was placed on the economic realities of mining, including calculating the cost to mine one ERG and understanding how the declining emission schedule (currently at 12 ERG per block, reducing by 3 ERG every three months) creates scarcity dynamics.

The presentation also highlighted the Sigmanauts mining pool as a DAO-governed alternative to traditional pools, offering unique features like storage rent (Demarage) distribution, bonus token airdrops, and community voting on pool decisions. Marc emphasized mining as both a business opportunity and a way to support true decentralization, while stressing the importance of efficiency optimization and proper thermal management for long-term profitability.

## Key Discussion Points

• **Ergo's Fair Launch Philosophy**: No pre-mine, ICO, or VC funding; built by former Chainlink and Cardano developers with a 97.7M max supply cap
• **Mining Economics**: Formula for calculating cost to mine one ERG, emphasizing electricity costs as the primary profitability factor
• **Emission Schedule Impact**: Block rewards declining from 12 ERG to 9, 6, then 3 ERG permanently, creating supply scarcity
• **Technical Setup Considerations**: Hardware requirements (6GB+ VRAM), thermal management, power efficiency optimization
• **Autolykos Algorithm Benefits**: ASIC-resistant, memory-hard, GPU-friendly algorithm that runs cooler and extends hardware life
• **Heat Management Strategies**: Utilizing mining heat for home heating, basement placement, proper ventilation systems
• **Sigmanauts Mining Pool Features**: DAO governance, storage rent distribution, bonus tokens, 1% variable fee structure
• **Future Opportunities**: Integration with AI/LLM workloads, solar power setups, heat recapture systems

## Decisions Made

• Sigmanauts mining pool will continue distributing storage rent (Demarage) proportionally based on miner participation
• Pool fees remain at 1% but can be adjusted through DAO voting by miners
• The pool will explore adding custom payout features and potentially integrate with new Ergo mining innovations
• Documentation improvements needed for transparency on distribution methods

## Notable Quotes

> "Ergo is a blockchain done right, by the people for the people." - Marc the Shark

> "Mining is securing the blockchain network. You provide computational power, hash rate, and the network rewards you with ERG tokens. Think of it as getting paid to run security for a digital bank." - Marc the Shark

> "It's a very anonymous way to just dollar cost average into ERG... virgin coins, a virgin wallet, where it's like, it's literally only ERG coming in here that's mined." - Marc the Shark

## Participants

• **Marc the Shark** - Primary presenter, Sigmanauts mining pool operator
• **CannonQ** - Community member contributing technical insights
• **Cheese Enthusiast** - Technical contributor discussing mining protocol improvements
• **Various other community members** - Contributing questions and technical discussions

## Additional Notes

The presentation included practical mining calculations, hardware recommendations, and emphasized the importance of viewing mining as both a business venture and a way to support Ergo's decentralized ecosystem. The session concluded with discussions about potential protocol improvements and the evolving landscape of GPU mining in relation to AI/LLM demand.
