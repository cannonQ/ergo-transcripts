      "summary": "Bruno introduces the Gluon Gold stablecoin project, explaining the four core operations: fission (splitting ERG into stable and volatile coins), fusion (redeeming both types), and transmutation (converting between coin types). The protocol maintains constant reserve ratios and differs from SigmaUSD by requiring simultaneous minting/redemption of both coin types.",
