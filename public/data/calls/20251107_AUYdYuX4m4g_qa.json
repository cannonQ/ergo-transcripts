      "answer": "Right, so there will always be 100 tokens. It depends how many are collected. My goal would be to collect around 300,000 to 400,000. So one token will be worth, so you can just divide it by 100, right? So if we collect 300,000 ERGs, so one token would be worth 3,000, right? So 3,000 ERGs would be one token.",

      "asker": "Grayman",
      "answer": "Yes, that's a good question. So what you will get if you participate? So first of all, you will get CLB token, which will be representing your part of your contribution. Anyway, after that, you'll get some airdrops from our partners additional as a bonus. And then your liquidity pool is bootstrapped with 0.3% fee. So during these two years, all the fees will be accumulated for all the people who will be trading USE tokens with ERGs back and forth.",

      "asker": "Grayman",
      "answer": "So after the second year, when you construct liquidity, you get liquidity tokens like LP tokens. These LP tokens will be locked in a redeemed smart contract with CLB tokens for two years. So after two years, the smart contract will unlock the redeem function. So you will be able to exchange your CLB token to liquidity token and after that, conventionally remove liquidity from liquidity pool.",

      "asker": "Grayman",
      "answer": "Well, people can purchase tokens from the secondary market. It means someone sold it. Did they get the air drops? Yes, so if you contribute ERGs during the initial bootstrap, you will get Airdrop and the CLB token. After that, CLB token will be traded on the secondary market.",

      "asker": "Grayman",
      "answer": "No, these tokens, so this contract will exist forever, right? The redemption contract. So you can redeem the portion of liquidity pool of liquidity tokens and then redeem liquidity or you just can keep these tokens in your wallet for 10 years and just accumulate fees. Your LP tokens will be locked in the original USE LP liquidity pool and they will stay there until you decide to redeem them.",
