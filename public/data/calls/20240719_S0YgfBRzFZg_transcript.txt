[00:19] **Dan Friedman**: All right, all right, all right, welcome to another exciting edition of the Ergo AMA. I am your host Dan from Japan Friedman, the Palmyra co-founder/Ergo strategic advisor, and with me I have the man of mystery, the man of stuff that always sits in front of other stuff, and his name is qx().

[00:50] **Dan Friedman**: And that just seems like it's like, you know, quantitative extraction or something. Anyway, the, the, the, this guy to my over there here, here. Yeah. Here. Yeah. I can't get it right, man. Where are you? There you are. Yeah. All right. All right. All right. All right. So yes, I say hi to everybody.

[01:15] **Dan Friedman**: Quality extreme.

[01:17] **qx()**: Good morning, Dan. Good morning, everybody. How are you guys doing?

[01:21] **Dan Friedman**: Well, I would have a good morning in offense, except it's evening right now. So there's that.

[01:28] **qx()**: That's right. That's 11 o'clock over there.

[01:31] **Dan Friedman**: It's 10 o'clock, but you know, who's counting?

[01:34] **qx()**: Yeah, yeah, yeah. So what's new over there, Dan? How's your week been? How's Palmyra been going? How's your interactions with blockchains? All that kind of stuff.

[01:45] **Dan Friedman**: What's new? Interaction with blockchains has been good. We've interacted quite a bit. We're talking things out. We might get back together again. 

Yeah, no, we just released an update to the Winter Protocol, which is really nice. We're actually expanding our Web3 libraries for the upcoming Palmyra Pro release. So that's gonna be really cool. We're gonna be utilizing a lot more of the traceability modules in there. Also going to be working with the oracles because that's where you basically you're also going to have data collection coming in from various producers when they actually go on this traceability journey. So that will be really, really interesting to start rolling out with our producers more and more.

[02:46] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah, we got mgPai, the magic pie guy at our office in Osaka right now. He's working away. Now just don't worry guys. I'm letting them take bathroom breaks like once a day. Okay. It's not like I locked them in a room with a computer and told them to program stuff the entire time. Okay. He does get some, you know, some rec yard time and whatnot.

[03:21] **Dan Friedman**: So yeah, just really starting to hammer out all of this good stuff with Palmyra Pro. Yeah just, and of course while gearing up for RareEvo that's gonna happen damn in like a month. Did you make reservations at the IHOP to make sure? Yeah I have, and don't act like you don't know because I told you that yesterday. I told you that the Airbnb that I got over there is strategically placed within a six minute drive from an IHOP. Six minutes. We can be in an IHOP in six minutes.

[04:05] **qx()**: We can eat it for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, Dan.

[04:08] **Dan Friedman**: All three meals. Listen, country fried chicken steak is good for any meal. So there is that.

[04:20] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah. Also, I'm actually going to be heading out to Bolivia. What the hell am I talking about? Sorry. I'm just getting over a cold right now. Some little foggy from all the NyQuil I took, but no, no, no. The country next to Bolivia, Argentina. Heading over there. I'm going to be doing some stuff on the ground. I will let everybody know as things progress what exactly it is, but basically it is obviously to do with commodities.

[04:47] **Dan Friedman**: We're also going to be attending and sponsoring the ADN conference in Argentina in Buenos Aires. As I understand, it is in the southern hemisphere, so it is super cold there right now, which is going to be weird because it's like 35 degrees outside Celsius in Japan. So I got to remember to pack warm clothes, which is going to be really odd because I'm probably going to go on the plane in shorts.

[05:19] **qx()**: Can I ask, as far as what you do here, where you visit these countries, what's the catalyst for that? Do you see a good that is being underserved?

[05:33] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah, absolutely. I mean, for us, so the commodities that we onboard have to check off several checkboxes. So number one, it has to be over a billion dollars, right? So the market share of this commodity has to be over a billion dollars. The second one is it has to have some and preferably nice infrastructure set up, right? So there is already some sort of trading going on, contracts going on, but they're just underserved, right? So they need to have more digitization. The third one is just traction. Is there really a need for this stuff? What is the market size globally and what is the access that we can provide for them?

[06:28] **Dan Friedman**: Argentina has several really hot commodities in the bean sector, also in the metal sector, particularly in lithium. So it's actually a pretty large producer of lithium. So I'm going there to create relationships and focus on some of these commodities, mainly on lithium, to potentially bring it onto the Palmyra platform.

[07:00] **Dan Friedman**: And so lithium over there actually has various different issues that, as I outlined, are a problem that we can solve with Palmyra. For example, market access. So while they do have quite a booming lithium industry over there, quite a bit of it has been kind of bought out by foreign interests. And so the value doesn't stay in Argentina. It gets moved to where they can actually transact with it.

[07:34] **Dan Friedman**: Now, also the other problem is that the grading systems in lithium and just worldwide are actually, there is no official grading system for lithium. And so what happens is a lot of times with these emerging economies, so if they do stuff like sell lithium, they try to sell lithium to the Teslas and the Panasonics of the world. Those guys have actually their own really, really strict quality assurance guidelines that need to be met.

[08:07] **Dan Friedman**: And so say a country like, for example, like Australia, right? They'll have a better infrastructure to accommodate that, right? So they will get first dibs. But what I think we can do with our platform is actually create that grading system for them because we already are doing that for tea. To have this on-chain grading system for lithium, we can make agreements with the various entities in the field to adapt as the official grading system. So that's another little hanging fruit. But essentially, it's about creating more access to their industry. It's about opening up a global market for them.

[08:54] **Dan Friedman**: It's also, I'm also going to be potentially targeting local exchanges, commodities exchanges, because actually lithium is already traded mainly on the CME as futures. So, there is already such a thing as lithium futures. And it's also traded on the LME, the London Metallurgic Exchange, or I think it's the LME. The main one is the CME, Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

[09:31] **Dan Friedman**: So the groundwork has been laid down for this. So it's very interesting because while there is quite a bit of infrastructure already laid down, there's still quite a bit of underserving going on in that particular region. And I think we can fix that and give them that market access, give them the digitization that they need, and give them the organization that they need with Palmyra.

[09:54] **Dan Friedman**: Of course, all this tokenization is happening on Ergo, so this is good for us because we need to bring those transactions on chain. So yes, it's going to be very exciting because there's actually quite a bit of variety and complexity in the lithium trade, which we can then utilize the blockchain for. Yeah, so really interesting stuff.

[10:23] **qx()**: Very cool.

[10:24] **Dan Friedman**: Very cool.

[10:26] **qx()**: Anything else before I dive into Sigmanauts and Ergo, other updates? Did you apply for Catalyst? Rosen got Catalyst, right?

[10:36] **Dan Friedman**: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. That's right. So the Rosen, yeah, the Rosen Runes got approved. So yeah, more funds for the Rosen team. Good news for Ergo. Great news for Ergo because we're going to get more adoption for Ergo tech. We didn't have any Catalyst proposals this round. We were doing our fundraise and so we figured we'd concentrate on one thing at a time. But I'm very happy that Rosen got the funds and I'm really grateful to the community for the support that they've given to Rosen, because we did help incubate it. And I'm just glad to see them really kind of kicking ass.

[11:32] **qx()**: Yeah, yeah, 100%. All right, let's see. On our side, on the Sigmanauts side at least, we successfully hit that multisig. It took a couple days this time, but we've pushed the funds. It was about $5,400 from the Sigmanauts treasury. We pushed those to the merchandise supplier. So they are making custom merchandise for us. We're having hats. We're having shirts. We're having long sleeve shirts and some stickers. And those stickers are those old astronaut stickers, the original back in the day. So those would be kind of retro and cool.

[12:12] **qx()**: So we're taking all that merchandise to, or some of the merchandise to RareEvo. We're going to try to sell it so that not necessarily make too much of a profit, but to make the money back and also bring in Sigmanauts money there. And then all the leftover stuff, we're going to start, as I said last day, we're going to try to work with Auction House and develop an on-chain kind of NFT represents a physical object. So you buy the NFT on Auction House and then you get shipped the physical object. So we're working on that, which should be pretty cool.

[12:42] **qx()**: That's exciting. But for RareEvo, we have a working document. I believe Dan's in that chat. Rosen Bridge is in that chat as well. So we can figure out if we're joining tables, if we're going to keep separate. We're all kind of at the corner L shape of an island. So we have that opportunity that we can do that last year. Dan, you get the couch. It's a couch, a definite.

[13:06] **Dan Friedman**: There will be a couch. Yeah, you're going to be sleeping on it. Is it going to be red leather? I don't know. I don't know. For you, I'll get pink. Hot pink.

[13:19] **qx()**: So we have those things to figure out. Mark's got some good ideas as well. He's going to 3D print some key chains as well that we're going to give out or sell. But we're working on demos. I've talked to Mr. Pixel and he's agreed to buff up a Cyberverse Citizen for us with like a jackhammer, like a fishing rod and an apartment and a mining rig perhaps, whatever he can do, and we're going to have a machine out there on the desk so people can play Cyberverse live with a pretty buffed up character, hopefully. So they can get a good feel for that.

[13:56] **qx()**: Of course, we're probably going to do the Cakewheel giveaway, where we give away the Twitter account again, and also NFTs and things like that if you create an Ergo wallet. That was kind of fun. And a bunch of other stuff. Might bring a projector to make a big video and display that behind us depending on what day. Dan, are you bringing the big banner? No, you. You're bringing the big banner? Okay, all right, cool.

[14:19] **Dan Friedman**: Yep, yep, bringing everything.

[14:22] **qx()**: Nice. Yeah, so we're really looking forward to RareEvo. I'm gonna go on a diet right now so that I can intake all those IHOP calories every morning.

[14:32] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah, yeah, you're gonna be on an endless pancake diet.

[14:38] **qx()**: We'll be so sleepy by the time the conference comes on. That'll be great.

[14:41] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah. Yeah. You know what? Every time somebody says Mark, the Shark, I always think of, you know, the, like that shark in Suicide Squad. Oh, yeah. The shark in jeans. Yeah.

[15:00] **qx()**: Mark doesn't bite quite as much as that guy.

[15:04] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah. And he's not voiced by Stallone.

[15:09] **qx()**: But Mark also is working on, we're working on migrating the Sigmanauts mining pool to a cheaper server. So that's, hopefully this week we'll spin that up and do some tests on it to see how that does. But that'll cut our price from about a hundred bucks a month to 50 bucks a month and not even 40, 45 bucks a month. So it'll more than half our price, which will then in turn bring more revenue back to the mining pool, which then brings more revenue back to the Sigmanauts treasury. So that's the end goal is to have revenue streams for the Sigmanauts.

[15:47] **qx()**: So that'll be fun. Mark is taking more of the lead on that, which is fantastic. So I won't be slowing him down, hopefully, with that kind of stuff. We met yesterday and went over all the code for payments for the BTC and the Rosen and all those kind of conversions that we do in the mining pool. So he's got that to study up on so that he's fluent with it and then should be smooth sailing.

[16:12] **qx()**: After that, qx() has asked me to fire up a separate mining pool so that he can test, what's it called, storage rent collection? So that's exciting. So I have to do that this week. I'll probably fire it up on the test servers that we're doing and we'll get that tested for qx(), which will be very exciting to be one of the first mining pools to collect storage rent.

[16:37] **qx()**: From what somebody said, I think right now there's about four or five hundred ERGs ready to be collected by miners once storage rent collection is being utilized for that specific mining. So that'll be a fun first paycheck for the miners in the Sigmanauts pool when we get it. Yeah, so that's looking forward to that.

[16:59] **qx()**: What else? I think that's all I got. The Sigmanauts mining pool also kind of split off on their own, a little bit more autonomous. They created a DAO and they essentially gave 5% of the active tokens to the Sigmanauts treasury, so that the Sigmanauts also still have a say in it and the Sigmanauts mining DAO will essentially just be a little more autonomous so they'll be voting on their own things where the Sigmanauts can also vote on it and then they'll realize profits beyond what it costs to run the pool back to the Sigmanauts group.

[17:41] **qx()**: I think that's all I got. That's all my old brain can remember for this week. Dan, we got some questions that we can shoot the shit out.

[17:49] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We have some questions. All right. Let's see. Oh, okay. So who are the current members of the EF? Are Joe and MHS off?

[18:09] **qx()**: I think, I don't think Joe is officially off. I think he's still there voting, right? You tell me. I don't know. I don't know. I'm not part of the EF. So I don't have an idea what goes on.

[18:24] **Dan Friedman**: I'm not actually in the EF. So yeah, I, yeah, as far as I know, there's a few people there.

[18:42] **qx()**: Yeah. Well you have, you've got Morphic, you've got Joe, you've got Glasgow, you have Justin Glasgow. So that's still there pumping. I don't think Joe has, I mean, Joe's spoken about potentially leaving the EF at some point, but if he did, he did it by himself and hasn't told anybody because as far as I know, he's still participating in the EF.

[19:10] **qx()**: Yeah, yeah, well but that would be Joe. Joe would stealth leave the EF and just not tell anybody. That'd be classic Joe. So wouldn't put it past him.

[19:21] **Dan Friedman**: I mean he is the guy that escaped to the, he doesn't he like own a mountain somewhere? An entire mountain, an entire mountain. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So Joe's got its own mountain. It's Mount Joe. You know, he can be anywhere on that mountain.

[19:37] **Dan Friedman**: Anyway, let's see. Oh, do we know the answer to this? When will Gluon Gold mainnet launch?

[19:48] **qx()**: I'm not sure about Gluon Gold. I know Dexy is gearing up now that kushti has done a lot of work on version 6 of the protocol that he was working on for a while, kind of put Dexy on the back burner. But I know that he's ramping that up more. So at least I know about Dexy Gold. That should be getting out there soon, sooner than before, that's for sure. But I'm not sure about Gluon. Don't have an answer to that.

[20:19] **Dan Friedman**: OK. Alright, let's see what else do we got here? So let's see. OK, let's see Dan. What can the pioneer testers expect for testing of the Winter Protocol?

[20:45] **Dan Friedman**: OK, so I think, and correct me if I'm wrong, but are you asking me what can they expect from testing it or for testing it? Because for testing it sounds like-

[21:02] **Dan Friedman**: From, yeah, okay, yeah, because I was thinking for, I don't think there's any kind of actual incentive given to them.

[21:09] **qx()**: You're gonna give them a thank you and a handshake.

[21:11] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah, well, basically, I mean, you can essentially try and implement the shipping standard that the Winter Protocol supports in, well, any kind of supply chain that you're currently a part of.

[21:34] **Dan Friedman**: So I mean, if you're talking about Palmyra pioneers, yeah, so the Palmyra pioneers will essentially be engaging in not just testing out the Winter Protocol, but testing out Winter Protocol on Palmyra Pro, which will utilize the Winter Protocol in a more robust way. We're also hoping for other projects to be able to use Winter Protocol for their own needs, which is why it's open source on Ergo and Cardano.

[22:14] **Dan Friedman**: I would actually would like to see that. I'd like to see people kind of, you know, forking the code, doing their own stuff to it, checking it out, telling us, you know, giving us feedback. So all these things would be nice.

[22:26] **Dan Friedman**: And I think as far as what they can expect from testing the Winter Protocol, well, they can expect to be able to use the Palmyra Pro app to utilize it within their process of curation and then moving into commodity. And then we will do upgrades, obviously, based on feedback. So this is why we're actively working on bringing volume to the Palmyra platform.

[23:02] **Dan Friedman**: All right, let's go to another one here. Well, here's another nice one. So what about onboarding wine to Palmyra?

[23:13] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah, that's actually something that I have been very adamant about, this is actually one of the first things that I, one of the first commodities that I considered, even before tea because of the connections that I have in Georgia for Georgian wine.

[23:32] **Dan Friedman**: Now, Proxy's NFTs are actually also behind the Blazer Labs. And Blazer Labs right now is working with the Moldova wine industry to onboard them onto the blockchain. And so I definitely would like to bring on Moldova wine onto Palmyra. We just need to figure out exactly how that would work. I mean, exactly what are we doing? Are we creating a forward contract for actual barrels of wine?

[24:11] **Dan Friedman**: Are we doing something where this is going to be fractional ownership of... For example, if you do it with whiskey, you can do a fractional ownership of a cask. And then as the cask gets bottled, you obviously, you know, the value of your asset goes up. Potentially that's something we can do with wine as well. So there's many different ways we can utilize the Palmyra platform with tokenization in wine, but we just need to figure out exactly how that works or what works actually.

[24:54] **Dan Friedman**: All right. Okay, hey, so qx(), been meaning to ask you, have you gone through all the, are you stuck or is that, do you just have the same expression on your face for like 20 minutes?

[25:10] **Dan Friedman**: Okay, you're not stuck, it's just an expression, okay. That's what I feared actually. Have you gone through the last ErgoHack submissions?

[25:23] **qx()**: Yeah, I forgot to mention that. This week I paid out $7,100 to the community awards. So if those of you who weren't following, kushti had started a fundraiser for community awards for the ErgoHacks. This is separate from the EF, 10,000, 8,000, 7,000, whatever those were, SigmaUSD rewards. So kushti started it. And I think it was MX came into chat and had said something like, I'm pretty sure it was MX, had said something like, hey, I want to pay any devs to do this or that kind of thing. I want to donate. And I said, just dump it in the community awards. And he did. Freaking crazy man. So he dumped like six to seven thousand ERGs into that. So that was amazing. So we had a ton of ERGs to reward the community.

[26:16] **qx()**: It was all voted on Paideia. And I just distributed that the other day and we decided to go full deep. Everybody we did a scaling thing with how many votes you got. So there were two third places, two fourth places, and maybe two fifth places if I can remember. So it was pretty well divided. I think first place was only $1,500 or something like that. Second place was $1,200 or something like that. So you can see that it was pretty well divided and scaled down. So that was great that we got those out.

[26:44] **qx()**: ErgoHack was ErgoHack honestly was amazing this time. It's amazing every time but this time you could look at it and I really thought to myself holy shit this is going to be really hard for the EF to figure out who was first. But they did. I feel bad for Rustin. Rustin, we volunteered him from the Sigmanauts, him a little begrudgingly to help judge for the EF. And that man takes it seriously. So I'm confident that he went through everything, at least from the EF side of the rewards to do that.

[27:19] **qx()**: But as far as the EF rewards go, there's still a thousand ERGs left from the community rewards that Mark Glasgow wanted to distribute to everybody. So each team, all 10 entrants will get 100 ERGs. And then I believe Angie's in charge of releasing the other rewards for the main thing. And I bugged the piss out of Joe to see what he's thinking for the Rosen rewards. Because if you read the ErgoHack, it says plus Rosen distribution. I'll bug him again today. We'll see. Sometimes, yeah. You just got to keep on the horn about that. But yeah, ErgoHack's awesome. It was great.

[28:01] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah, yeah. And it gets better every time. Like you said, it gets better and better every time. This is why I think I should be able to bring in some, and actually, we had some conversations about this already with some people in this ecosystem about bringing of just bringing outside ecosystems into Ergo to say the newer ones that have more funding, but they just don't have the talent to build out the tech.

[28:42] **Dan Friedman**: Ergo can build out the tech during ErgoHack. And since it's open source, they can then utilize it on their platforms. I mean, obviously, depending you know, what their core infrastructure is or what their core code base is. Yeah, they could utilize the code and build out their own libraries like that and build out their own base like that.

[29:06] **Dan Friedman**: So I think that might be really good because there's some ecosystems out there that actually, you know, yeah, they do have a nice strong community. They do have the resources, but they just don't have enough built out and they don't have the kind of, they haven't built the muscle of building things out like we have in the Ergo ecosystem.

[29:30] **Dan Friedman**: So yeah, I just think that would be a good, you know, kind of vector for us to slide in on because I mean, and why would it work? I mean, look at Rosen. You know, just look at Rosen. Rosen built out tech. I mean, it's not exactly the same, but Rosen built out tech in Ergo and then bridge this with a large ecosystem like Cardano. And people love it.

[30:00] **Dan Friedman**: You know, people love it in the Cardano ecosystem. People love Rosen, obviously, you know, and for good reasons, because it's great technology. But it's just an example of how, you know, yeah, Rosen is built on Ergo. But it is also multi-chain and it provides the ability for other chains to participate. And the Cardano community felt that it was valuable for them to have that technology on Cardano and to connect Cardano with all these other chains.

[30:29] **Dan Friedman**: And that's why the ROSEN team got funding for the Ethereum bridge or the EVM bridge. And this is why they got funding for Runes because they know they can deliver. And so I think that's actually something we can take across to other ecosystems as well, because other ecosystems know that we can deliver. So I'm really excited about that.

[30:50] **qx()**: I agree. And I had to, the swag payment of, you know, $5,400, I had to convert to fiat. I fucking hate converting to fiat. It's like one of the worst things in my life that I have to do once in a while. So I, you know, I'm in the US, so it's not easy for me. I have, my wife has an exchange on Gate because she's also has a Peruvian passport. I believe it's Gate. But I didn't go that route because I'm always nervous about putting stuff on central exchanges for too long and then trying to get them out.

[31:18] **qx()**: So, I had the choice of going through something like SimpleSwap or going through Rosen to the ADA pool, then straight to Coinbase. So, I tried it. I sent one. I sent a bunch of it. I sent most of it. I sent most of it over Rosen, but some of it over SimpleSwap. And with SimpleSwap, I went right to USDC, right to Coinbase. And with Rosen, I went, of course, to Rosen ERG. But Rosen ERG beat SimpleSwap over to the other chain. So that was fun. But then I had to use Splash to swap to ADA and then ADA to Coinbase, which probably only took 10 minutes for that.

[32:00] **qx()**: But it was a good experience to compete the two against each other. But honestly, when I'm sitting there and I'm thinking, okay, I've got $6,000, or it was, because I had to take room for slippage. I'm sitting there looking at it and saying, okay, should I just send $3,000 through SimpleSwap and $3,000 through Rosen? About 10 seconds of thinking, I was like, I don't feel comfortable enough to send $3,000 through SimpleSwap or StealthX or those services. So I only sent 500 ERGs through SimpleSwap and I sent 5,500 ERGs through Rosen and I was still more nervous about SimpleSwap.

[32:40] **qx()**: So that's kind of an example of knowing your assumptions, knowing what Rosen is, you know, we're part of Sigmanauts, part of Rosen. So we know what the watcher is. We know what the guard is. I can watch it every step of the way. Anybody can watch it on every step of the way or a simple swap and stealth, because I'm not missing them. I'm just saying those are that's that's a black box. You don't know what exchange it's going to exchange with if they're using a local liquidity pool that they have on their own ledger, or they're going out to some of their service provider and getting that and swapping that. And then customer support.

[33:10] **qx()**: With Ergo and Rosen Bridge, I mean, you can see it every step of the way. You can see it in the console of your watcher. You can see it in the console of the guard. You can see it in the events of the main dashboard on Rosen Bridge. So really, it was like, oh, 5,500 ERGs through Rosen Bridge, that's like tying my shoe. It's not a stress in the world. 500 ERGs through SimpleSwap, I'm sweating a little bit because I don't want to have to pay that if it fucks up. So that was an interesting experience.

[33:40] **qx()**: And speaking of open source tooling, Dan and that kind of stuff, we've got a question from Mark the Shark that I put up there. He says, Dan, can you pay mgPai to update ErgPy, please, sir, please? So ErgPy is beloved, Dan.

[33:58] **qx()**: So it's like the lowest barrier of entry. If you know Python, you can write transactions. You can mint NFTs with ErgPy. And I know mgPai, it's one of those things that he made early on when he joined Ergo. And it's one of the things that in his head, I'm sure he's like, well, let's just die so people can use Fleet SDK. But what he needs to realize is that his level is at Fleet SDK, where he can program that kind of stuff directly. But many people's level coming into Ergo, they see ErgPy and they're like, oh, this is golden. I can just build a transaction and send it with ErgPy? Amazing. And they may never get to that Fleet SDK status. And they may never need to because of a tool like ErgPy.

[34:39] **qx()**: I know I'm a proponent and I was banging on mgPai's door to make sure he doesn't forget about ErgPy. I think the only thing that people are asking for is that he makes the chaining of transactions more robust so that it's much easier to send so that it checks during the transaction building or something, it'll check the mempool and not take a box that's already in the mempool so that you don't have double spends.

[35:03] **Dan Friedman**: All right, all right. I'll ask him. I'll ask him. He likes to slack off and you know sleep and stuff when I know he's got at least four hours. He's got four hours in the day like he wants to see. He wants to get at least four hours of sleep a night. I don't know how these kids you know I don't understand the work ethic.

[35:29] **qx()**: All right, let's answer a tough one, Dan, right here, by your favorite guy, the big 3D. So the big 3D says, I'm struggling to keep people I know invested in Ergo, a lot of them selling due to lack of excitement and continuous price decline over the years. I guess we're getting into price discussion and that kind of stuff, Dan. You want to start on this, or you want me to start?

[35:51] **qx()**: Why don't you start? OK. If you're entering crypto purely of speculation and purely of the mindset that you're comparing Ergo to chains like Solana or chains like, I don't want to say Kaspa, or chains that are purely funded and bolstered and propped up by big-

[36:20] **Dan Friedman**: Up to Sui, up to Sui.

[36:23] **qx()**: By money. Okay, so that's what you're seeing. You're comparing a chain that has a grassroots initiative that has a foundation that focuses on builders and developers and funding them and a community organization that also focuses on the projects that are there and working on marketing besides that. If you're comparing that to Solana, where somebody can come in and just murder the price or pump the price in a matter of minutes right there for their own benefit.

[36:57] **qx()**: And other places that have these massive treasuries that are funded by outside resources that have a say essentially in particularly the direction of those chains. You think if you come into a chain and you invest 10 million into a chain, you don't think that people designing the chain and working on the chain aren't going to listen to you when you tell them to do something, you ask them to do something. So that's the risk benefit that you're getting from those kind of pumps over there.

[37:27] **qx()**: So my thought would be it's really not. I understand why you do it. To general people, all cryptocurrencies and blockchains look the same. But I don't think it's a proper comparison in that way. And I would also hesitate to say that every time I hear a complaint about the price going down or that kind of thing are not following, it follows the rest of it a couple days later. Yeah, I don't know. And as Joe would say, at this point in my life, I'm not really focused on that part of it. But yeah. Dan, what do you say about that?

[38:10] **Dan Friedman**: My gauging of an ecosystem, especially an ecosystem like Ergo, is different than, say, my gauging of an ecosystem like, say, Doge, right? There's different types of ecosystems out there, there's different types of blockchains out there. Some of them, yeah, some of them are just, yeah, you come in there if you want to screw around to make a buck, price, you know, numbers go up, numbers go down, that's what it's all about.

[38:43] **Dan Friedman**: If you're in Ergo merely for that fact, you're in the wrong place. Ergo is a long arc. Ergo is a community that is built organically, that was not founded by what you were talking about, you know, by the VC, Cabal, the Aptos/Suis of the world with, you know, with whatever, a billion dollars in the piggy bank.

[39:09] **Dan Friedman**: All the growth you see here is organic, and none of this has been artificially, you know artificially injected, you know, I mean like for example like with Aptos, right? I remember when Aptos launched. Like one day in one day just all of a sudden Aptos is in the top 50 and they have like 200 projects building on and I'm like what now? You have 200 projects building on this thing really? 200 really? Yeah bullshit.

[39:40] **Dan Friedman**: I mean, that's what it is. But yeah, the price pumped. The price pumped. A couple of simps like us made a few bucks. Most of the money went to the guys that pumped all the money into it, the big boys with the tens of millions and hundreds of millions of dollars and the funds and all these guys, those guys made the money I mean really and with Solana is the same way the same thing even with like with all these other ecosystems is the same thing the big boys they said pump the money in there they're the ones that are making money okay this is not sustainable organic growth okay so looking at those numbers you're the product you're the product yeah well yeah exactly exactly so to me-

[40:29] **Dan Friedman**: You know like I said it's okay to also be mindful of the price. Yeah, I get it. I get it. Okay. You know, people want to see people want to see it go up, right. But to me, an ecosystem like Ergo has more intrinsic value than just numbers go up. And if that is the reason why you're in it, you're in the wrong blockchain. You're in the wrong ecosystem.

[40:51] **Dan Friedman**: There are people in this ecosystem that are building, that are excited about the ecosystem. We can see this, by the way, the ecosystem has been growing. I mean, it has expanded. We have projects that have gone cross-chain, but they're still building on Ergo. You know, Rosen is still building with Ergo Tech. We're still building with Ergo tech. And we're going to continue building with Ergo tech. There's other projects out there that are still building and will be building with Ergo tech. And it's okay to go cross-chain. It's okay as long as you don't grift, as long as you actually have a reason to go cross-chain.

[41:35] **Dan Friedman**: So I see the ecosystem, yet it has grown exponentially since last year. It has grown. It has matured. But sometimes the price doesn't reflect that. And I mean, that's just the nature of the business. I mean, like many times in the crypto world, in the blockchain world, price doesn't reflect real progress. You know, it just doesn't. It's just all about the, you know, it's big, but it's small enough to be manipulated by the big players.

[42:12] **Dan Friedman**: And, you know, I mean, look at the German government. You know, they make Bitcoin dump like what, how much is because they, oh yeah, we're just going to sell this Bitcoin. You know, Mt. Gox, oh, they're going to start selling Bitcoin. The market dumps. And I'm not talking about a dump like you would get in, like you get in, in the stock market, right? You don't get this kind of stuff in a stock market. A stock market dumps like what? A few percent people, people lose their shit. You know, with us, we go through like a 10% dump in one day and everybody's like, oh shit. Well, I guess it's still kind of bear market-ish. But it's okay. You know, it's okay.

[42:48] **Dan Friedman**: In a volatile ecosystem, in a volatile environment like that, like I said, what you have to look at is what has the longer arc. Do short-term price movements have the longer arc or do things that cause or attract long-term mass adoption have the better longer arc? And for Ergo, I think that is it. We have, in fact, grown. We have, in fact, increased in numbers and engagement and more and more taking this ecosystem seriously and I think is going to continue going. I mean, like I said, look at the ErgoHack. Look, look at these. Our ErgoHacks are getting smaller. They're getting bigger. They're getting more robust. You know, look at the Sigmanauts. I mean, the Sigmanauts are getting smaller. The Sigmanauts aren't, you know, there's, there aren't people like leaving the Sigmanauts in droves. People are-

[43:41] **Dan Friedman**: People are participating, right? People are, you're building up a treasury. You got all these different things you're using, you know, in-house products like Paideia. I mean, it's, stuff is moving, stuff is being used. Tell me how that's going for Aptos.

[44:00] **qx()**: Yeah, I agree. I think, and with all due respect, the big 3D, I put up another one of your questions here. If you're saying that since the price action is where it is now, the whole ecosystem is at a standstill, man, I'm sorry, but you're completely wrong. The ErgoHacks prove against that, the amount of building that all the community devs do, the dev updates that we cover every week. That is certainly not a standstill not whatsoever So, you know if you're looking to say something just say what you mean and that is the price has come to a standstill not the ecosystem because ecosystem surely has not comes to a standstill we're strong we're building like crazy and Yeah, it's that's inaccurate. I would say sir All right What else we have here Dan?

[44:47] **Dan Friedman**: What else do we have? Well, we have Mark the Shark asking us. Oh, well, he's saying, I'm a Python builder, not a TypeScript dev, so. Building tool and TypeScript is a lot harder and slower.

[45:01] **qx()**: He's talking about mgPai or ErgPy again.

[45:03] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I was actually having this conversation with mgPai the other day. You know, when I just started getting into the dev space, it was back in the 90s, right? So back in the late 90s is when I started, you know, when I was in my early 20s, I was working on one of my first serious projects from McGraw Hill. And so we were programming at that point in Java servlets, which is stuff that you young people might not even know about. But it is the type of pain that you will not experience unless you really are in for pain.

[45:42] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah, so we're talking about we're working with ASP and we're working with Oracle 8 and Java servlets. And so we were building dynamic websites at that point using that dynamic content management system website. And this is back in 1998, 1999. So this is before WordPress and all this stuff that we take for granted today. This is back when they used to have, you know, McGraw-Hill and their publication Aviation Weekly had to have a staff of like 30 webmasters, as they called them, I don't know if they still call them that, to take the content from the editors and then format it into, you know, so it doesn't look like shit on the website and then post it to the website.

[46:30] **Dan Friedman**: So they didn't have viable content management systems. So we're actually building that out. It was one of the first jobs I had as a professional was building out this content management system called 2Share, which was actually one of the first, if not the first, content management system that could actually take a Word file or you take a formatted file from most major office or word processing applications and you could upload it to their website that was running the software and it would actually upload and it would look good. It would format it. It would parse it. This was just not a thing.

[47:09] **Dan Friedman**: Plus it was cross-browser compatible, which was also a big thing. Cross-browser compatibility was a big problem back then, because IE and Netscape at that point, because it wasn't even Firefox, it was Netscape and Internet Explorer, were running two different code bases. IE had their own Microsoft components that just didn't work on Netscape, on Mozilla. For example, iframes, they did not work on Netscape. So you had to have this cross-browser compatibility thing that was always a pain in the ass. So a lot of this stuff had to be built out in scripting languages like JavaScript.

[47:56] **Dan Friedman**: So we were talking about the JavaScript of my days with mgPai, and it is just, you know, it took me a bit of time to actually, like, take JavaScript seriously, because back in my day, you would get laughed at if you used JavaScript for anything that has, like, you know, database queries. I mean, literally, so JavaScript back in 99 could actually utilize JDBC, ODBC, but you literally had to put the database address, username, and password unencrypted into a text file that anybody could literally access and download.

[48:40] **Dan Friedman**: So there was literally like no security, no encryption. And so I actually tried, I forgot exactly for what, but there was one time I actually tried to build out a portion with JavaScript and a portion of that required access to the Oracle database. And I'm just like, and people is like, no, no, you can't do that. No, JavaScript is not meant for that. JavaScript is just, it just, it just bullshit scripting language. And, and, and then, you know, fast forward, like whatever, 15 years later, JavaScript is like the thing. And now you got TypeScript built on top, but you got all this stuff built on top of it. And, um, and, and still, you know, when I really got back into, uh, the coding scene, just like JavaScript, really guys? Like, really? Is that, is that what we're going with now with JavaScript? I mean, not even like PHP or something. Nobody. Nobody took PHP to the next level. You just stay with JavaScript. Okay.

[49:37] **Dan Friedman**: So yeah, I was talking to mgPai about that. It just took me so long to really just be okay with the fact that we're using JavaScript. And regardless of everything I know about it now, it's just like, I'm like, I still have this, you know, gagging reflex from being, being, uh, you know, being, being a dev in the nineties or like JavaScript. Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't trust it with anything. Yeah. So, yeah, but it's a brave new world out there. And I guess, uh, yeah, we have to old guys like me have to adapt to it.

[50:12] **Dan Friedman**: All right, let's see. Let's see, in the 90s and wooden computers. Actually, no, those were in the 70s. We had wooden computers in the 70s. Actually, one of the first Apples were built out of wood.

[50:24] **qx()**: Yeah, Steve Wozniak.

[50:26] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The first, in fact, it was the first Apple that was built out of wood. So yeah. Yeah. I did have a computer- So I did build it out and I built out one computer inside a 70s stereo one time. So I took, I got it, I got it, an old receiver that was just dead and I used the, the inside to build out, uh, the two as, as, as my, uh, as my computer case. So I did do that. This is back before they were. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But yeah, but before they were like, you know, getting up there in value. Now people like oh my god, what are you doing? I mean I look at this. I got all these 70s receivers back there but You know back, you know back in those days. It's like well, you know and i'll give it to you for a dollar if you want Yeah, you see in my garage sales on the road.

[51:21] **qx()**: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah We got a suggestion from Baseless Speculation. And that is that Andy, Andy, if you can hear us, to change the title of these weekly AMAs to something like Ergo PoW blockchain weekly updated AMA, just to get more of a general catch for external Ergo audiences. I think that's a pretty good idea. It's probably the best idea that's ever come out of Baseless. That's probably the only idea that's ever come out of Baseless. Maybe I'll say that. So good job, Baseless. I'm proud of you. Watching and commenting and baseless instead of in the chat here where we can actually read it.

[52:00] **Dan Friedman**: So Luke No, okay, let's go to this one because when we see there was there one I don't know when Dan tell us more about the less Millennium. Well, okay, so I'll tell you this one one story So this is back in back. See you guys. I'm gonna go- it's, it's okay. You're, you're, you're already going. You're, you're that age. You never stopped going after this.

[52:31] **Dan Friedman**: So back in the eighties was when I was started getting to programming, right? And this is back before actually, like I was, I was still in Soviet Ukraine and we didn't have, I didn't have access to a computer, right? So it wasn't like a thing that people had, unless you're really rich or connected. Right? And we weren't poor or anything. We were, you know, we were okay. My father was a manager of an IT department downtown. So it was, you're right there, twitchy.

[53:04] **Dan Friedman**: And so, but we never had a computer at home, you know, cause it was just too expensive or too unattainable. And so what I would do is I would, I learned BASIC, and I would write programs in BASIC on a piece of paper and then I give it to my dad and he'd take it to work and then he'd punch it into the computer and then give me to bring the readout back to me that it would give, right, to see if the program executed correctly or not.

[53:32] **qx()**: And so... That's some slow debugging right there, Dan. That's rough.

[53:35] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah, yeah. That's really slow debugging. And yeah, by the way, do you know where that term came from?

[53:44] **qx()**: They were actually moths in the vacuum tubes of the old computers, right?

[53:48] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah, the ENIAC and UNIVAC, they had to actually literally go in there and take out the bugs because they were shorting out the vacuum tubes. Anyway, that was before my time, too. That was way before my time. That was my dad's time, actually.

[54:05] **Dan Friedman**: And so one of the things that we actually used to do back in those days is kind of try to figure out ways to just fuck with stuff that was programmable at that point because we didn't have a computer or we didn't have access to a computer. So one of the things that we had in one of the schools that I used to go to were programmable calculators. Now, and this was like really, you know, high tech back in the eighties, right? So it's a programmable calculator that you can actually put in like a routine, the subroutines into.

[54:36] **Dan Friedman**: And so I figured out, I forgot what language it was using, but I remember I figured out a way to program bowling into the calculator. And so I took this calculator and it had the numeric readout. It wasn't like graphic or anything. It was literally a numeric readout on the calculator. And what it was is basically I programmed it so the numeric readout does an upside down nine. So it looks like a bowling pin, like it just kind of sits like this, right? It's a bowling pin.

[55:12] **Dan Friedman**: And then you would press the key and all it was was just like a randomizer, right? And so, you know, you press the key and it would just like, you know, all the, like all the, all the upside down nines would, you know, would turn into zeros if you hit the pins and then you would, you know, and then you would like change, you go, you press, what was it? You press four to go left, you press six to go right. Yeah, yeah. So that is some 80s, 20th century shit right there. That is some oppressed Soviet raw dogging programming for you people.

[55:50] **Dan Friedman**: All right. So I did that. That did happen in my life. So I hope you like that story.

[56:00] **Dan Friedman**: All right. Let's see.

[56:04] **qx()**: I already blinked twice.

[56:06] **Dan Friedman**: Oh, you did. That's why you were blinking. I thought you were having an aneurysm or something.

[56:12] **qx()**: All right. I just put up a question because I want to talk about this a little bit and not in general. All right. The question is for Wombo. If you want a political question, thoughts on Vitalik's post about against choosing your political allegiance based on who is pro crypto.

[56:28] **qx()**: So I can't stress this enough. I'm not going to comment on his paper. I did a quick little scan of the title and maybe the first paragraph this morning. But I can't stress the amount. So I think this branches off from what we were talking about earlier about when the big 3D's questioned. But if you're into things that are influenced by large amounts of money and are out of your control and aren't decentralized and are centralized, I can completely understand why you would be very worried about the political landscape, about people taking more control of things. Because when you have a system that is controllable, then governments can control that system.

[57:12] **qx()**: So by all means, I understand why people are saying, oh, this one political candidate is favoring Bitcoin or that kind of thing. So that's great. But when you build a system like Ergo, as Joe says, you're building for war, 100%. It shouldn't fucking matter. That's the whole point of this goddamn system is that it shouldn't matter if the US government hates Ergo or somebody else hates Ergo and restricts it. They can't fucking stop it. That's the whole point of this system.

[57:41] **qx()**: So if I see you complaining and saying, look, you know, these governments need to be friendly. This needs to be friendly. I get it, as far as accessibility-

[58:02] **qx()**: I have a whole political thing I can go off on, on one single issue voters. And the amount of things you give up for those single issues that you then supported by candidates. And also about them wielding your single issue vote just for that specific reason and not giving a shit about that in the long run. I'd say to that, you guys are smarter than that. Come on, you're in Ergo for a reason, most of you. Be smarter than that. Know that Ergo is built for war. Know that fuck those governments that don't accept it or want it. It doesn't matter. It's not going to stop it.

[58:43] **qx()**: It's a peer-to-peer system that can still continue on whether or not some candidate tells you you can't trade it or can't buy it somewhere. It's going to happen, you're going to be able to get access to it. I mean, in the US, I don't have access to it, but I still get it. Same kind of thing. And once all of Ergo is distributed on the chain and miners are working off TX fees and storage rent and other incentives that are yet to be thought of or implemented, it's going to be a complete peer-to-peer system at that point of exchange of values. So bring it on. Fucking bring it on. I think that would make crypto stronger in that aspect of it.

[59:22] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah, and there's nothing wrong with being single if you're an issue voter. We could be married, too.

[59:31] **qx()**: That's a good point. I should have put a comma in there, Dan. My apologies.

[59:36] **Dan Friedman**: You brought that on yourself. Well, listen, I think this is a good place to wrap it up.

[59:41] **qx()**: Muhammad invited us to a cage fight, Dan.

[59:47] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah, so I just wanted to leave with that. So we've been invited to a cage fight that might happen in Las Vegas. We'll see.

[59:58] **qx()**: I think I look small-ish on screen, Dan. But as you know, in real life, I have a bit of some sort of farm muscle to back up my jib. So I'm happy. I grew up a farm boy for the first 15 years of my life, Dan. Yeah, you can tell you can tell by this neck head that this head then release shoulders so Mohamed Esmer come to come to RareEvo and i'll do a cage match with you. We'll do we'll sponsor It'll be sponsored by Ergo and we'll do it as a fundraiser for Ergo. I'm happy to do it with you.

[60:32] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah, that'll be good Anyway, cage matches aside. I think it's a good time to leave it off So yeah are from all of us at the Ergo eye in the sky. Thanks for joining the AMA. Thanks for all the questions. And you know what it is, same time, same place, same channel next week. And until then, this is Dan from Japan, barely alive, signing off.

[61:04] **qx()**: All right, buddy, thanks for trying.
