[00:14] **Dan Friedman**: Hey everybody, this is Dan, coming to you all live from Japan.

[00:18] **Dan Friedman**: And I'm here to wish you a happy anniversary.

[00:22] **Dan Friedman**: It's been five years since we launched Mainnet, and what five years has it been?

[00:26] **Dan Friedman**: I came into this ecosystem a few years ago, and right away I saw the potential of this ecosystem.

[00:33] **Dan Friedman**: I mean, the people, the tech.

[00:36] **Dan Friedman**: Everything about it screamed innovation, screamed first principles, and these things really attract me.

[00:45] **Dan Friedman**: Now, since then, I've seen exponential growth in this ecosystem, more projects, more people, more innovation coming.

[00:56] **Dan Friedman**: ErgoHack is an amazing place for innovation.

[01:00] **Dan Friedman**: We have some of the greatest products and some of the greatest solutions coming out of ErgoHack.

[01:05] **Dan Friedman**: I am amazed and really can't wait to see what comes out of every single ErgoHack that we have.

[01:14] **Dan Friedman**: And that's not all, obviously.

[01:16] **Dan Friedman**: I mean, we have such organizations as the Sigmanauts.

[01:20] **Dan Friedman**: Which is a completely autonomous group.

[01:23] **Dan Friedman**: I mean, it's a product of total decentralization.

[01:29] **Dan Friedman**: How many other blockchain ecosystems can say that they have a community group

[01:37] **Dan Friedman**: that has their own DAO that has their own decision makers that have their own committee that has their own plan.

[01:46] **Dan Friedman**: Outside of the foundation model, outside of these things that the web three world is so used to which is basically - it's not decentralized, it's more like a federated network - but we have it here, right?

[01:52] **Dan Friedman**: And it's not just the Sigmanauts, we have other community organizations doing things in the ecosystem that is amazing. We have such amazing tech coming out of the ecosystem like Rosen Bridge - I mean look how much it exploded, look at it - amazing innovation.

[02:17] **Dan Friedman**: It was born and it runs on Ergo and we should all be proud of cultivating something like that in our ecosystem.

[02:25] **Dan Friedman**: Projects like Dexy Gold, another great piece of innovation.

[02:30] **Dan Friedman**: ChainCash, I mean, the list goes on and on.

[02:33] **Dan Friedman**: The point being is that innovation is born here and that is a very, very scarce commodity in this space.

[02:45] **Dan Friedman**: Myself, I have not only been trying to advise or been advising the foundation and participating in the ecosystem, but I went to the next step.

[02:57] **Dan Friedman**: I started a business in this ecosystem.

[02:59] **Dan Friedman**: Palmyra was started and it is an Ergo-centric business.

[03:04] **Dan Friedman**: I have invested my own money, quite a bit of money, to start this business in this ecosystem.

[03:12] **Dan Friedman**: And we hire from the ecosystem.

[03:15] **Dan Friedman**: We build for this ecosystem.

[03:17] **Dan Friedman**: Our core technology runs on Ergo.

[03:21] **Dan Friedman**: This is a business decision that was made by myself and as well as by other founders of Palmyra to utilize Ergo for a viable business solution.

[03:31] **Dan Friedman**: And this would not have happened

[03:33] **Dan Friedman**: without the level of innovation, without the level of brain that is in this ecosystem.

[03:45] **Dan Friedman**: I can trust this tech as a business person to do solid business for myself.

[03:51] **Dan Friedman**: This is why I build on Ergo.

[03:53] **Dan Friedman**: This is why Palmyra builds on Ergo.

[03:57] **Dan Friedman**: Our technology is viable, it's reliable, it's versatile, and it's safe.

[04:02] **Dan Friedman**: And all of these things are needed for mainstream adoption of technology and for a blockchain technology.

[04:08] **Dan Friedman**: And this is what is going to drive Ergo as the backbone, as the infrastructure of Web3.

[04:19] **Dan Friedman**: I look at us as

[04:21] **Dan Friedman**: the US Steel of Web3.

[04:24] **Dan Friedman**: We can be everywhere.

[04:27] **Dan Friedman**: Our infrastructure can be the backbone of many, many, many things.

[04:32] **Dan Friedman**: And that's not all.

[04:33] **Dan Friedman**: I mean, of course, we have amazing Web3 projects.

[04:37] **Dan Friedman**: We have NFTs.

[04:38] **Dan Friedman**: We have art.

[04:40] **Dan Friedman**: We have applications like SkyHarbor, projects like Blitz, another amazing project that I'm a huge fan of.

[04:51] **Dan Friedman**: So it's just so versatile, this ecosystem.

[04:54] **Dan Friedman**: And I am so excited to see what's going to come in the next five years.

[04:59] **Dan Friedman**: I think we're going to hit it out of the park.

[05:01] **Dan Friedman**: I think this ecosystem is going to explode exponentially more than it has already exploded.

[05:07] **Dan Friedman**: And so I sit here excited, waiting and participating in this ecosystem to help it

[05:17] **Dan Friedman**: blossom and to help it move and to help it grow.

[05:22] **Dan Friedman**: So once again, I hope that

[05:27] **Dan Friedman**: everybody shares this sentiment.

[05:30] **Dan Friedman**: I hope that everybody shares this excitement that I have for this ecosystem.

[05:34] **Dan Friedman**: And I know that you do.

[05:37] **Dan Friedman**: So once again, Ergo, I would like to wish you a happy Ergoversary.

[05:42] **Dan Friedman**: I am forever in love with this ecosystem.

[05:46] **Dan Friedman**: And like I said, I cannot wait to see what the next five years will bring.

[05:50] **Dan Friedman**: So once again, this is Dan coming to you live from Japan, signing off.
