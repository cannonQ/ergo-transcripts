      "asker": "qx()",
      "answer": "I'm working on sub-blocks CEP, focusing on how to pack transactions into input blocks sub-blocks and how to update state. Some transactions depend on block header contents, so validity can change from one input block to another. The current proposal is to allow them in ordering blocks only (full blocks every two minutes), but 99% of transactions could be confirmed immediately. Still working on transaction forming and state updating, which is the hardest part.",

      "asker": "qx()",
      "answer": "If there's a box that's reached its age of four years and doesn't have enough ERG to cover storage rent, the whole box is destroyed and claimable by miners. If that box contains any tokens, those tokens also go to the miners. This allows for recycling of old, abandoned tokens back into circulation.",

      "asker": "qx()",
      "answer": "The focus is on peer-to-peer digital free banking, including peer-to-peer smart contracts, powered on-ramp for Ergo, and cross-chain tests. This would be especially valuable for assets being ignored or censored by centralized exchanges like privacy coins and proof of work assets. We also need to consider what layer 2 solutions would be beneficial and work on uncensorable, decentralized on-ramps.",

      "answer": "It's similar to Bisq with on-chain escrows, using multi-sig escrow from participants in the exchange and maybe some arbiter party. This is how hodl-hodl works for Bitcoin. We need to experiment with proper UI and concrete schemes, but the basic concept involves smart contract escrows to facilitate peer-to-peer fiat-to-crypto trades.",

      "question": "What makes Ergo's multi-sig unique compared to other blockchains?",
      "asker": "qx()",
      "answer": "Ergo uses real cryptographic threshold signatures that preserve zero knowledge. For example, in a 2-of-3 multi-sig, external observers cannot tell which specific parties actually signed the transaction. Only the participants themselves know who the real signers were, and this privacy is preserved in the ring. This is unique compared to most other blockchain multi-sig implementations.",
