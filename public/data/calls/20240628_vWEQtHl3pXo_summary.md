# P2Podcast Episode 1 Community Call Summary

**Call Date:** June 28, 2024  
**Call Title:** P2Podcast | Episode 1

## Executive Summary

This inaugural episode of P2Podcast features community members tmr.erg and Marc the Shark launching a grassroots podcast to discuss Ergo blockchain developments and make the ecosystem more accessible to newcomers. The conversation covers their personal journeys into Ergo, upcoming Ergoversary celebrations, recent ErgoHack developments, and their vision for Ergo as a smart layer for Bitcoin. Both hosts emphasize the welcoming nature of the Ergo community and encourage others to contribute regardless of technical skills, embodying the "just send it" philosophy of organic community-driven content creation.

The discussion highlights Ergo's fundamental differentiators including its fair launch with no pre-mine, non-custodial dApps, built-in privacy features, and proof-of-work consensus mechanism. They explore how Ergo is positioning itself as the "last man standing" by building decentralized alternatives to traditional financial infrastructure, particularly through bridges like Rosen that enable Bitcoin DeFi capabilities.

## Key Discussion Points

• **Podcast Origin**: Community-driven initiative to create accessible content explaining Ergo to newcomers and non-technical audiences
