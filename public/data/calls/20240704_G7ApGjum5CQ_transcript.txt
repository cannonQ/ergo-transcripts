[00:18] **CW**: G'day, guys. Welcome to Hash It Out. This is a special Ergoversary anniversary Hash It Out. I've been roped into this through qx(). It's nice to have Quokka and Dan on as well. So let's shoot the shit and see what happens over the last five years and see where we go. All right. What do you want to start?

[00:40] **qx()**: Why don't we start about... Oh, Dan. Dan, you do it. Go for it.

[00:44] **Dan Friedman**: No, no, no, no. Why don't we start with you, qx()?

[00:48] **qx()**: Me? Start with me? I always talk, Dan.

[00:53] **CW**: Let's do a little bit of a recap, actually. So, like, we've all been here for differing stages of throughout the Ergo sort of life cycle, I guess you could call it. Let's just do a sort of roundtable and start with qx() and just give us a bit of your intro and your involvement in the ecosystem.

[01:10] **qx()**: Right. That's a great, great hosting there, CW. Way to bring it back around. I love it.

So I enjoyed my time in Ergo back in 2022. Joined, like everybody joins through Cardano. Came over to Ergo, haven't looked back. I don't think I hold anything else. Maybe I hold a little ETH when I try to transfer things to people for money that don't take Ergo. That's about it.

But yeah, that's it came in and started building these kind of bots for price action and price monitoring and price checks. And then from there I joined an ErgoHack, which was a lot of fun, made a little application for paying out devs kind of on an automatic payment book. That's I think archived now and then stuck around and hopped all the Sigmanauts hopped in. I think Wombo was very encouraging to post in dev chats and those kind of things.

And I think it was Noah, maybe that brought me into the things. I can't remember. Apologies if it wasn't.

[02:16] **CW**: I think it's going back a while.

[02:20] **qx()**: And then started just cranking away, seeing a lot of holes to fill. I like filling holes, as Dan knows from seeing me in Vegas.

[02:30] **CW**: This is hash it out. Oh, geez. All right. Well, thank you very much for that little synopsis there. Let's move on to Quokka. Give us a little bit of a recap of your involvement throughout the Ergo ecosystem and the time you've spent here.

[02:44] **Quokka**: Yeah, sure. So I joined in 2021, like February, March 2021. Yeah, I remember it was a very small group chat at the time. And it was Glasgow, like a couple people. I think Noah was there too. Were you there, CW? I can't remember.

[03:01] **CW**: Yeah, December 2020.

[03:04] **Quokka**: Yeah yeah you were you were there and I remember super small group chat and I started posting on reddit like I tried spreading Ergo because nobody really knew about it yet and I remember I got this one post it had like a thousand upvotes it really like it kind of blew up and that was the only reddit on like rcc that like the Ergo post that didn't get deleted because it was before everybody started kind of swarming it hiding on it.

And that's when like the first pump happened. I don't want to take credit but you know like the the time aligns it doesn't matter. Can you do it again Quokka?

[03:43] **Quokka**: I've tried. I tried. People have tried. It hasn't happened, but you know, we'll see.

So I moved on. I found out about NFTs, Ergo Auction House, everything open source. I loved Ergo. I love proof of work. I was a big Bitcoin guy before this, so Ergo seemed really cool to me. And then I got into NFTs on Ergo, started Ergo Sores, continued that, still going on to this day and same with Sky Harbor.

[04:11] **qx()**: It's with your sister, right?

[04:12] **Quokka**: Yeah, it's with my sister. She does the art. There's a bit of a hiatus right now, but we still have it in mind. Then we built Sky Harbor with a few other ecosystem developers, Krass, you might know him. And then soon after, Krass came to me with an idea for DuckPools. We spent a couple of days thinking of the name and I remember just one day he messaged me like all caps. He's like, DuckPools, that's the name. I was like, that's a good name. And yeah, so we've been working on that ever since. And here I am.

[04:47] **CW**: Sweet. All right, Dan, the man from Japan, what's your involvement with Ergo and how long have you been around the Ergo ecosystem for?

[04:55] **Dan Friedman**: Well, it all started in a... So how have I been involved with the Ergo ecosystem? Well, I worked with kushti at IOG for some years.

[05:07] **qx()**: Is that when you fell in love?

[05:09] **Dan Friedman**: And that's when we fell in love. And we gave birth to our baby Ergo. Ergo baby. Yeah, that's right.

Yeah. So, yeah, so kushti, you know, kushti, of course, he was a researcher for IOG and... Actually, I met him for the first time in Malta in 2017, like an IRL. Before that, of course, I was working with him, but it was remote.

And then, yeah, I remember he was doing research for IOG and then he kind of started to go more and more, like more and more quote unquote silent in the chats and everything. And so I remember 2019, you know, about two months, two weeks or so after Ergo actually launched mainnet. Charles told us this is like, Hey, so kushti launched his own blockchain.

And there's an opportunity to mine, right? And so we started actually trying to set up a mining rig. I'm not sure if they did, I think they did finish setting it up. I mean, it wasn't like my mining rig was the IOG mining rig, you know, IOHK mining rig for Ergo.

And yes, since then I started following, you know, what kushti was doing. And about, but you know, I was kind of in the shadows. So obviously I was following what he's doing and I was following Ergo, but it was in the shadows. It was kind of like this, like, you know, an unspoken secret love that was happening. Yeah, it was my mistress. It was my mistress to Cardano.

[07:16] **qx()**: Dan, I don't want to hear about relationships before me, so why don't you just continue on.

[07:21] **Dan Friedman**: Don't get jelly, qx(). Don't get jelly. You're going to be all right. You got enough hats. Look, I mean, Ergo has a neck. That's one thing. I'm sorry. I like people with necks.

[07:36] **qx()**: It's been a while since you commented on my neck.

[07:39] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah, yeah. It was about that time. It was about that time. Sorry. It just you let you let us you let us down that path.

[07:48] **qx()**: I did. I pull up. You're in the weeds. Keep going down.

[07:50] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah, I don't know where this is going. Let's go. Oh, God. Oh, God. Here comes the hat. Here comes the hat. The hat master.

Yeah. And so, yeah, I was kind of following it. And then I'm like, you know what? Like, it's kind of, it should grow faster, right? And so I pinged kushti in 2021 and I said, Hey, you know, how can I help?

And so we, we talked and he says, well, you know, come on to the foundation and help with business development. So I did. And I've been working with the foundation ever since, in various different capacities.

And of course, I mean, you know, fast forward a little bit more, right? So I guess what is it? Yeah, like late 2021, early 2022. One of the things that I started really kind of trying to push on Ergo is more commercial adoption, you know, and more and more commercially viable products, because we got a lot of brilliant devs, we got an awesome infrastructure.

A lot of great products, but I just wanted to see a lot more mainstream viability. And so when I didn't see enough of that, I said, you know what? I think I'll do that myself. And so that's where the idea of Palmyra came because I wanted to build something on Ergo. I wanted to start a real business on Ergo. Something that brings commercial adoption, mainstream adoption to the tech, something that uses it in that capacity right outside in the real in the real world part of a part of a wider solution, which is which is what I thought is it could have the biggest impact.

And so yes, it started building out the Palmyra platform. Yeah, about two and a half years ago. So I'd say about a year, maybe a year, like a year, a little bit more into into my tenure at, as a strategic advisor and yeah, just it wasn't easy at first that not, not because obviously not because of, of Ergo, but just because, you know, starting a business, which at that point was the bear market, you know, like it wasn't easy. Yeah.

[10:20] **CW**: The grind goes on.

[10:21] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah. It took quite a bit of money to get started. Personal money. It was really painful to be spending so much personal money to get it going. But I did what had to be done and now we've got a thriving business that's utilizing Ergo as its core technology.

[10:44] **CW**: Yeah, it's cool to watch. It's fair to say, I guess we've all been around for X number of years now.

[10:51] **qx()**: You don't get to skip it. You're next. Tell us about your beginnings. Come on, come on.

[10:59] **CW**: So basically I found Ergo in the end of 2020. And it was through an Ethereum miner mentioning it in passing and I remember finding it jumping in and there wasn't too much information and Quokka mentioned about Reddit. So I think at the time it would have been...

It would have been early 2021 when Glasgow made the Sigmanauts subreddit. I remember joining on there and I was one of the first handful of people joining on there and I've always been one to hate social media as such and I actually downloaded Telegram to be able to get some more up-to-date information because the comms weren't too open at that point in time.

Yeah, basically, you know, people say don't marry your coins, but here I am married to Ergo, what four years later or whatever it's been and just I think, as a number of people can attest to they donate their time because they see the value in Ergo and they believe it should be positioned in regards to capitalisation a lot higher than what it actually does has been given credit for so people are screaming from the rooftops and that's where I donate my time throughout the ecosystem as best I can.

So it's fair to say that we've seen a lot of growth in a lot of things over that period of time, like you see the birth of certain dApps. And I think at the time there was only, I think it was the auction house and ErgoMixer. We had a shitty wallet with Yoroi when Spectrum DEX came on and yeah, there's waiting 15 minutes with a circle of death to try and make a transaction on Yoroi because it was just a shit fight.

I think that's one of the saving graces was Captain Nemo coming in with Nautilus and he started to unlock the potential of what we see now on chain with SigmaFi and DuckPools, obviously, Palmyra is coming, everything else that's in the ecosystem. So it's pretty cool to be able to watch that growth and evolution throughout.

[13:13] **qx()**: Yeah, those kind of things are really cool. I say that a lot. There's always like this one. If you think that things how like explosions work in these kind of ecosystems is you think like, where do the things come out of come out of you so fast?

But the truth is that the potential always kind of existed in these dApps were could easily tuck in behind just one little floodgate. As soon as that little floodgate is popped up, like Spectrum DEX is out and it's functional, boom, it just like explodes from there. So that's where these jumps come from. And technology is where there's just one little floodgate that's stopping it. And then as soon as that open boom, everything comes in beyond that, like Dan's company right there. You know, as this builds up, it's just going to open more opportunities and it's just going to, you know, start exploding like that. So, yeah, very cool.

[14:01] **CW**: All right. So that's the serious side. Let's have a bit of fun, I guess. What's some highlights that you've experienced over the last couple of years that, you know, let's highlight some funny things, bad things.

[14:16] **qx()**: Let's talk about what's real drama.

[14:23] **Dan Friedman**: Oh, you know, like one of the things that I still get into is, you know, once in a while I'll talk to people about Ergo. And like... Yeah, yeah. And, oh yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I know Ergo. I know Ergo is that company, right? Is that Japanese company? I'm like, no, that's Emurgo. Yeah. It's the insurance company in Germany. Yeah, it's, yeah, yeah, yeah. No, it's, it's that's Emurgo and this is Ergo. Oh, okay. Well, then I don't know.

Yeah, so quite a bit I'll get people when I speak to people in the industry, I'm just like, so you know Ergo? Oh, of course, yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, okay, so what is it?

So what's your policy ID? I'm like, it's not a token, it's an L1. And it just goes back to it every week, every two weeks. So what's your policy ID? Can you give us your policy ID? It's not a...

[15:58] **Quokka**: I've given up. I've given up on the conversation between coins and tokens.

[16:05] **qx()**: I'm done explaining it like insight to how fucked up a lot of the space is, you know, I've been involved in some listings, you know, in the back rooms, and I won't say any names, but I, you know, in one of the listings that we were working with some of the devs, there was...

You know they're working on trying to do some transactions and get their wallet working and they're like banging against this like this isn't working this isn't working you know what's going on and come to find out they had like 0.1 ERG in their wallet and they were building a transaction with more than it.

And it's like, and even the output says not enough, not enough ERG for input or whatever that I'm like, oh, we are fucked, you know, centralized exchange. That issue right there. You know, they're probably used to some executable they click on with a GUI, and then they say, okay, this token maps here, and it's just plug it into the centralized exchange when you know, Ergo is a little bit different.

[17:07] **CW**: And to the EVM credit as well. They have built that around that infrastructure where it is such a simple solution to be able to implement the ERC-20 tokens. But obviously, like I was saying, the difference between a token and a coin, it's a little bit different.

[17:25] **Quokka**: They can build it easily for Ergo tokens as well, but it's all a separate L1.

[17:30] **CW**: Whatever. I like at the moment the Ergo community getting on board with like the banter around Kraken and old Mark. He's actually a good one. I like him. He participates. He calls things out. He throws us cheeky little comment here and there. And that's all you kind of want is a little bit of engagement. Yeah, he's heard of us.

[17:52] **qx()**: But, you know, I mean, these kind of things boil down to the fact of what CEXes are, right? They are in it to make money, period. And currently, you know, these kind of things as tech is not the sexy thing at the moment to make the money. So it's, you know, we end up suffering in that aspect of it, unfortunately.

[18:35] **CW**: Yeah, we just need a cute little... Yeah, we need a cute little... We need a cute little meme coin, like a quokka or something.

[18:43] **Quokka**: Dan, send me a selfie. I'll convert it to a girl.

[18:57] **qx()**: I think we can do that. Snapchat filter quokka and make Dan a girl.

[19:01] **Quokka**: I paid, I accidentally paid 60 bucks for like a year subscription for the app that converts you to a girl. I got you, Dan.

[19:11] **CW**: I'm not asking why you got that.

[19:13] **qx()**: We're not touching that one.

[19:15] **Dan Friedman**: and see how that works for me. That's what it was all about.

[19:30] **qx()**: He accidentally hit the install button, accidentally typed in his iOS password, accidentally double clicked on the thumbprint skin.

[19:37] **Dan Friedman**: Next time you see, next time you see Quokka, I just, you know, he'll bring like a pair of high heels and be like, yo qx(), can you put these on for me? I just wanted to see something. Does my ass look fat?

[19:48] **Quokka**: CW does my ass look fat?

[19:51] **Quokka**: Oh my god, wait, I might create an alt account called Quokka-ita.

[20:05] **Quokka**: Doesn't matter. I remember one funny event that happened in the last five years since this is our anniversary and all that. Two or three years ago, I think two years ago, 2022, there was somebody who bought like a 90,000 ERG NFT on Sky Harbor. I don't know if you guys remember that.

[20:22] **CW**: Oh, yeah, I remember that. Was that one of the dinosaurs or something? It was one of the dinosaurs. You gave it back to her.

[20:29] **CW**: You fucking gave it back, didn't you?

[20:31] **Quokka**: We gave the fees back for the first transaction. But the second transaction, since they kind of sent it back to each other on Sky Harbor for the trustless smart contracts, we were like, hey, man, you're causing us a lot of trouble. We're going to keep the fees on this one. And he agreed to it. So we offered that. We appreciate that. But I remember it was a whole thing.

Krass messaged me. Hazy messaged me that day. He's like, holy fucking shit. And I get a screenshot. And I remember we pinned it to the Discord chat.

Close it close Sky Harbor and just move on Look we split the money trust me. We did not make that much that much off that 2% fees Like and we split that between like three four dudes. We got out with a grand each, you know.

[21:47] **qx()**: So what happened you had a you had a dinosaur posted for 90,000 ERG.

[22:01] **Quokka**: No, I guess somebody did because obviously I didn't, I wasn't owning it. We were selling them. We were auctioning them. So somebody bought it.

[22:04] **qx()**: So the person that sold it gave the money back.

[22:07] **Quokka**: They listed it and apparently the person's Russian or something. So on our website, we have 90,000 and it's a comma. And because he's European or Russian, we thought the comma was a period.

[22:18] **qx()**: It's like why would why would we have three zeros there bud, but whatever, you know Everybody only do I think we need to take a lesson from this that don't use your fucking main bank bag Don't put it in a goddamn hardware wallet and hide that under the bed Yeah, what the fuck.

Anyway in saying that my one of my highlights is it's actually when Dan, Charles and kushti were in Dubai and they did an interview and it was around the time when they did the max output and it was what was it 45,000 outputs or something at the time and Charles was talking and he's like oh you know you guys are good you do this and whatever and he's like what's your maximum output now.

And kushti is like, no, casually just says 15,000 or whatever in one transaction at 45,000 on-chain transaction. And Charles is like, holy fuck. I just, I just remember that one clear as day. Yeah.

[23:24] **Dan Friedman**: I know that that was all the right place at the right time. Yeah. Cause we're all in Dubai and yeah. Yeah. So since I was finally able to put that, pull that together. Cause people have been asking me for that. it was, you know, it's not easy to do all that stuff to coordinate everybody.

But yeah, that was a good one. That was actually after the, I believe it was after the Ergo meetup that we did in Austin that we did during Consensus 2022. And we did this Ergo... Yeah, it was 2022. So we did an Ergo meetup in Austin.

A lot of people came, including Charles. And so, yeah, we did that transaction live, right? So, a max output transaction live. And I think at that point it was what, like 15,000 or something like that. It was the top and yeah, yeah, yeah. So we, yeah, we put that together and that was actually really good meetup. You know, people, I think we onboarded quite a few people during that meetup.

Quite a few people, you know, a lot of people really started to, I mean, they kind of knew Ergo, but they really started to talk about it after the meetup. You know, I think that that actually, that meetup was actually the, one of the turning points, especially with the Cardano community to get more, you know, to become a lot more interested in Ergo, to participate in Ergo.

And I think that's actually kind of sparked the beginning of the social onboarding of people onto the Rosen Bridge era. You know, I think without that, without that meetup, without being able to get a little people in the same room and to talk about Ergo and without, you know, Charles talking about Ergo there and kind of giving us some really good, you know, some really good feedback and soundbites, I think it would have been a lot harder to kind of get people to really understand the impact of being a watcher on Rosen and participating in the catalyst proposal, the first one we put in for Fund 10.

Because that was also, you can't just come in there and say like, oh, hey, guys, by the way, we want money from your ecosystem. And we don't really have it really built anything in your ecosystem. But we kind of did. And you know what? We were able to do that because people were familiar. They saw that Ergo was ready to build something.

In Istanbul, that was a really good one. We had MHS Sam do a presentation on Rosen Bridge. Yeah, that was really cool.

[26:35] **CW**: I was in Dubai. You did one in Dubai and to Turkey.

[26:37] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah, we did one in Dubai. But the problem with Dubai was that that was organized kind of really poorly and it was sort of like in an office lunchroom and some random building and it kept moving like three times.

Yeah, the Dubai one it was supposed to be an actually kind of a nice venue. And I'm not even sure why. But for some reason, they moved it and they moved it like a couple of times. And they ended up being in this office. And I like it just some it was like literally an office lunchroom. And they had pizza and stuff. And I'm just like, and it was shitty. It was like cold.

And I was talking to some of the people in there that I didn't know like, Hey, so do you know about Ergo? No. It came for the pizza. I don't know for the pizza. Like, oh, OK, great.

Yeah, at least, you know, at least the one in Istanbul, there were people there that were like genuinely fascinated with Ergo. We had a media coverage over there. We had a couple of, you know, pretty well known Turkish influencers talk about Ergo. So that was really cool. That was really cool. And we actually we did...

Kind of give, you know, I I I I see a lot more life in the Turkey Ergo telegram chat now after that has happened. So hopefully I think I noticed that as well. Some good some bad.

[28:10] **qx()**: I got sucked into I got sucked into like a baseless version of a Turkey chat. It was like I got involved in that. That was rough. I got attacked as soon as I got in there. I was like what the fuck is going on in here? And then one of the guys, one of the nice guys in the chat was like, hey man, just don't pay attention to these guys. These are the guys that kicked out of the main Turkey chat. This is a fucked up chat. I was like, oh, OK.

[29:00] **qx()**: Well, one of the guys was a Mohammed Esmer, who was banned from the main chat. Yeah. And now he thumbs down every single post of course. No. Thumbs down everything, because people.

[29:14] **Dan Friedman**: It could be like big brain. You know, you would think that kushti is like the most like admired, benign dude that nobody hates. But then he's got some haters. I remember I remember one of the first AMAs that we did.

And you know we saw the comments and there was this Russian guy and they're writing in Russian and he was just going off on kushti and I mean like kushti like I said I was like the most like benign like like sweetest dude you don't even think like no how can you hate kushti and this dude like hated him like yeah yeah just go go to prison he's gonna be in prison and then he called me mario like later on he called me mario.

Yeah, yeah, yeah. I whacked it right back at you.

[30:21] **qx()**: You did. Good job, sir. All right, what about, I think we could name all the blunders that happen when we give, when Joseph Armeanio was given the keys to something. I remember one time...

[30:32] **Dan Friedman**: I didn't want to mention that. I didn't want to mention that.

[30:35] **qx()**: We'll start off easy.

[30:37] **Dan Friedman**: Well, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. You know, like Joe, man, he's an awesome dude. I love Joe. But like once in a while and he knows it I'm not even like I don't think you're gonna be like embarrassed by this at all but like once in a while you ask Joe a question and he'll give you an answer there's nothing to do with what you asked.

I don't know if it's on purpose or not. Did I just ask that? Am I just too stupid to understand the answer? Like once in a while I'm just thinking, I'm like, you know, the dude is pretty smart. So maybe I'm just too stupid to understand the answer. And then I'm like, No, no, he just kind of didn't answer it at all and just did what he wanted to do.

Like Joe was like one of those guys. He's like the free spirit of Web3. You know, he just, he's like, he's like the whip pre-Bohemian. Yeah. Like, oh yeah, that question. I'm going to answer that, but I am going to answer this other thing.

[31:43] **Quokka**: He has a great answer for another thing. That's for sure. I haven't noticed that, but I do remember back when the thing with the keys that happened, I'll just say the Twitter account, it happened during CNFT con or a bit before that. I remember. And that's where I met, that's where I met you, Dan, like in person.

And Joe and I remember I completely agree with Joe about everything about regarding the Twitter account where people would pay tens of thousands of dollars for this kind of exposure and we're getting it for free and I like I still agree like I think the whole ordeal was blown way out of proportion by people who were just upset about you know get offline dude see your family or something. Well, I don't know.

[32:28] **CW**: That's a good point as well. Because if you look at the pricing things, for example, say an article on like CoinDesk or something like that, we've got one for free. It's 50k for free. So that thing, it's like you've got your, you know, your moral compass and all that sort of bullshit. But you know, whatever, marketing is marketing, business is business.

[32:47] **Dan Friedman**: But literally Charles paid for the thing to be made like yeah I was I was working at IOG I was working at IOG when he was doing it he had this whole like Ethereum Classic team and he was literally like employing these two guys when I want to do is is a mainnet client or something yeah yeah yeah it was Mantis and so he was like he was actually pumping all this money into building up that account and that like that that was him that wasn't because you know because people just like you know organically flocked to it he like dumped a bunch of money into this account you know like with his own socials with like everything and built it up so it's like well yeah i mean yeah it was that community thing but it's it's almost like like you know...

You know, the Sigmanauts, right? Does the Ethereum, or I'm sorry, does the Ergo Foundation own the Sigmanauts account? Well, no, it's like its own thing, you know, it's part of the ecosystem. Now, for some reason, the Sigmanauts decide to go to like, I don't know, like, I don't know, Alephium or something like that. You know, you're not going to be like, well, give back that account, that's an Ergo account.

[34:25] **Quokka**: It's whoever has the keys. It's whoever has the password and the fact that they didn't have access to it.

[34:29] **CW**: It's kind of... That's a very good point because if anything in crypto, if there's any lesson to be learned, it's not your keys, not your crypto. And that's a perfect example of it. And it's been multiple things in that ETC community that sort of, you know, they've blundered or let that sort of security side lapse of things.

Quokka can probably attest to this a little bit as well. And this is going back to when I think it was when Dan first came on and suggested doing more videos and more social things and having the AMAs and the dev updates and things. And Joe was I was talking to him sort of privately and he probably wouldn't mind me sharing this. He just basically says, you know, we're going to start doing these videos and things like that. And one of the chats that we're in, I think Quokka was in at the time as well, is like, everyone was starting giving him, he released the first video and the price of Ergo dropped like a dollar. And then the next week releases another video and then sure as shit, fucking bang, another 50 cents gone. He's like, why am I doing these videos?

[35:48] **Dan Friedman**: You guys are cool, but you need to go outside for a while. You know, like the videos were just like, okay, guys, you can't stay, you can't stay indoors all day long. You have to go outside and play just a little bit to let people know that you're, you know, that you're alive because you can only fit so many people inside your house. You know, you can only invite so many people to your house. Like, come on, don't be afraid. I actually have these, you know, these are real conversations just to go on in a little tangent with a few people, with a few builders that are in the Cardano ecosystem as well.

There's no way they said that. This is a real conversation. I'm like, I'm like, you guys are not going to fucking outer space to Jupiter. Like, you gotta go outside. You must go outside. And yeah, like, these guys are like, probably like, they're like, raw dogging you or something. Yeah, man, I'm gonna raw dog for two weeks, man. I don't need, I don't need to be outside.

[36:59] **qx()**: Oh, God. I can't imagine what the chair smells like, Dan. Holy shit.

[37:30] **qx()**: So I remember a time, what was it, somebody, who was it, somebody tipped in about, back then it was probably only like $100 or $50 worth of GreasyCex token, or somebody tipped Joe about $100 worth of GreasyCex token. And then there was an event and the price went up quite a bit and Joe being Joe is just fucking around and shit. He's like, yeah, cool. Cool. There's an event. I'm going to give somebody all the tokens that somebody gave me. He ends up tipping somebody like nine hundred dollars worth of GreasyCex tokens. That's enough to tank the liquidity pool. But in classic Joe format. Right.

[38:09] **CW**: I remember him getting tips. It was like a. I was over a billion or a billion Husky token someone tipped it to him. I'm assuming it's Husky but and he's like, yeah, who wants it sends it off to some random on Twitter.

[38:27] **qx()**: And Joe's like, well, I guess it's me. And so that's how he got roped into it. But that's how we all get roped into this shit. There's a hole and somebody's got to fill it. That's for sure.

[38:58] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah. I'm sorry, guys. I came in and I got you out of your comfort zone and I made you like, shave and take showers. And well, you know, if you had this case that then would then didn't take but you know, I'm just someday I'll take. Yeah. Maybe someday, maybe someday your wife will yell at you enough. You're like, okay, qx(), you take a shower and bring it out the garden.

[39:21] **CW**: Oh, okay. You're just about to say something, mate.

[39:27] **Quokka**: Oh, I was just going to say, I remember in the early days, like, like early 2021, people would be tipping in the group chat, like send like 30, 40, 50, a hundred ERG. And now the price is even lower and people are tipping way less.

[39:41] **qx()**: It's like squirrels holding on to their nuts at wintertime.

[39:44] **CW**: It's funny you say that. I wanted to at one time go through my tip wallet and actually sort of work out how much it fluctuated over time because like you said, you know, you just throw in 20, 30, 50 ERG around here and there and the price was like, you know, four bucks, five bucks or something. You can give it a second thought. And now it's like, you know...

[40:27] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah, because I gotta jump off of this.

[40:30] **qx()**: Dan's wife is literally standing right in front of him staring at him right now. She's been doing that for the last three minutes, I bet.

[40:37] **qx()**: Yeah, there she is. Blink twice if you're okay, Dan.

[40:42] **qx()**: Oh, boy, he's in trouble. Alright, let's do this.

[40:48] **CW**: So what are we doing?

[40:50] **qx()**: The Wallabies, mate. If anyone doesn't know, the Wallabies is a rugby team. It's our national rugby team. And I'm not talking about that at all, because it's woeful.

[41:16] **CW**: But in regards to the future of Ergo, Dan, you mentioned it, I think one of the biggest catalysts will be Rosen. Oh, big time, big time. Having the security sort of backing the Ergo, the Rosen Bridge framework and how it interconnects all the existing and future listings and networks that are supported by Ergo, as by Rosen, I should say, sorry.

Yeah, it's exciting. I couldn't sort of be happier in the way sort of things are progressing as well with the speed and things. So there's a lot of things going on behind the scenes and just delivered the Bitcoin bridge, the EVM modules have been created. There's just a bit of refactoring needed to be able to implement that at the moment.

But then after that, we'll start to sort of phase out the Rosen Light era. And then what that means is we'll start listing potential tokens and sort of native assets cross-chain, so both Ergo tokens, Cardano tokens, Ethereum tokens, as such. I think that will be a pretty decent catalyst for bridge utility. And that's, yeah, it's all these transactions, whether it's happening between Bitcoin or Cardano or Cardano and Ethereum or Ergo and Cardano, et cetera, it all sort of benefits Ergo because it is, the consensus is happening here on Ergo.

[42:38] **qx()**: CW, do we know that?

[42:40] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah, Palmyra is slated to be released on Rosen as well. It's already in there.

[42:51] **qx()**: Do we know the, in all seriousness, do we know the next arrows of Rosen? Is it going to be after Rosen Light? Is it going to be Rosen Whipped? And then after Rosen Whip, it's going to be like Rosen heavy cream.

[43:00] **CW**: Full cream.

[43:01] **Dan Friedman**: Go to your room.

[43:09] **Dan Friedman**: I was thinking about that joke.

[43:13] **qx()**: You're like, I was gonna try it with extra virgin olive oil.

[43:17] **Dan Friedman**: But you know, I actually saw qx() years. Yeah, yeah, like smoke coming out and like years like moving like yeah.

[43:28] **qx()**: All right in all seriousness bringing this back yeah I think before we go too far off the engine I think people need to remember of why Rosen Bridge chose Ergo you know that proof of work security layer that's just unbeatable anywhere else and Rosen actually has incentive to make sure that Ergo succeeds and is always you know secure with enough hash rate to secure the network so...

I mean, you have that big catalyst there that's driving Rosen to, you know, make sure Ergo is successful. So I think, you know, it's a great partnership and it's fantastic that the team chose to chose to write on Ergo.

[44:12] **CW**: And it's a cool little story as well, how Rosen came to life. And basically, Quokka, you remember this, the Susie bridge and the Graviton partnership, and they were going to bring or open up the Ergo ecosystem. And time after time, MHS and his teams building these connectors and Susie changes and gets rugged and turns into...

It's like sweet candy swap or some stupid shit now. Who knows where it's at.

[44:44] **Quokka**: I made a BTC as a scam. I'm putting this on the record and it should have been on the record for a while.

[44:52] **CW**: Call a spade a spade. But then also, The Ergo philosophy, the open source or open mindset, it's like, fuck this, this is a problem, let's build our own solution. And here we are with Rosen Bridge. And that's one thing I love about the ecosystem. It's just like, identify a problem, build a solution, open source it and send it out to the world.

[45:13] **Quokka**: And in the end of the average...

[45:38] **Dan Friedman**: But it was actually, Rosen was, you know, was in a way accelerated by Palmyra because, you know, I mean, I obviously saw the awesome potential of it right away. I also saw the like, you know, soon TM happening a little too much with it. And I said, all right, guys, what do you need to roll this out? We need to roll this out. This is needed for the ecosystem.

Said okay well we need liquidity and we need to come on a thousand dollars and this is like yeah yeah yeah and says okay let's let's make it happen yeah and we did that we did the proposals with them through Palmyra for you know to to work with Cardano twice you know we did one for for just you know Cardano Ergo we did the other one for EVM.

And yeah, they just pushed them over the line, you know, and they started just blowing up. And you see now we've got a proposal now for runes as well. Yeah, yeah, yeah. This one for runes. Yeah, this one for runes. Yeah. And it's I mean, look, you know, like we were talking about this on the AMA the other day by kind of like this tribalism. Right. And I think that some people in the Ergo ecosystem are a bit too obsessive about we want to have, you know, we want to be super unique. Right?

And we don't want to be, you know, we don't want to be associated like we don't want to be like the Cardano, the, you know, the brothers of Cardano or Cardano's little brother or whatever, whatever they feel that associating with Cardano does. And I just think that I'm sorry, that's bullshit mentality. You know, it's, we're on the same journey. You know, both of, both chains are on the same journey.

For eUTXO, we have, we have the same, you know, we have the same first principles. Many, many, you know, Cardano people are Ergo people, Ergo people are Cardano people. There is nothing wrong with working with both ecosystems and you can see how helpful the Cardano ecosystem has been to really getting and Ergo innovation out.

And so I just think we should embrace that. I don't think that us associating and being close with Cardano minimizes the individuality of Ergo at all. I think that it's the wrong way to think. I think that working together, we can get a lot further along. And then we should really embrace that. Because to me...

I work in both ecosystems and Cardano is, yeah, work quote unquote, right? And yeah, qx(), I mean, and it's not like, you know, sitting in some freaking computer room with the word, the lights go on and off automatically and pretending like you're working at that, you know, a Cornell university or wherever you work at, it's real work. Yeah, yeah.

So, you know, it's okay to me. To me, they're very, very unique. You know, Ergo is unique. Cardano is unique. They don't blend together, you know, and I think many people really truly understand that it doesn't blend for them either. It's not a competition. It's a cooperation. You know, like me and qx(), there is no competition. It's just cooperation.

And, you know, I mean, yeah, I do say... You might need a neck.

[49:14] **Dan Friedman**: You might. I mean, it's...

[49:18] **CW**: It all comes back to the neck. All right, qx(), here you go. Here's your thing for the future. You got to grow a neck.

[49:24] **qx()**: You know, Quokka and I were talking before you guys finally fucking decided to show up for about 10 minutes earlier. And we were talking about how Ergo it's it's it's interesting that people are trying to Ergo is involved in a time right where we're in a group of cryptocurrency builders and blockchain builders right but the unique thing about Ergo is that...

We're not facilitating or trying to aim for the same things necessarily that these other blockchains are aiming for so to compare something like Solana or to compare something like I don't know Kaspa or all these other or what's a bro chain or the Barney chain that Coinbase has Base or something.

Base Base chain Base Barney yeah so these these chains are looking for quick adoption burning bright you know lots of money pouring in for things that you know on the surface are you know NFTs that or or meme projects or that kind of thing I'm not saying anything bad about NFTs but meme projects...

And I feel like trying to put that same measurement tool and looking at Ergo is not, you're not doing any justice to anybody there. Ergo will have its moment to shine when this other shit burns out, or even before this other shit burns out. When people start realizing, oh, holy shit, this is what blockchains are for. Here are financial tools. Here's here's money that I can trade with my neighbor in another country or my family in another country. And it's going to cost me a nickel or a penny to do it by that time.

You know, all this kind of stuff that's finding the world's hopefully going to wake up to and be like, holy fuck, this is what blockchains are. And eventually that group of people in third world countries and, you know, non-U.S. countries are going to adopt and they're going to eventually drown out these fucking crypto bros who are like, just we're in it for speculation. We're just going to pump shit.

[51:33] **Quokka**: Yeah, anything that's not decentralized is fucked. But I'm going to say something controversial right now.

[51:36] **qx()**: Oh, shit.

[51:37] **Quokka**: All right. Oh, people were all saying Ergo is undervalued. All that. But my argument is not that Ergo is undervalued. It's at about what like 80 million market cap. I don't know. 50 million.

My argument is that all of crypto is overvalued because if you actually look at the stock market and you see, you know, 50 to 100 million dollar stocks then you see like these are actually valuable companies, you know, actually putting in physical labor and creating physical goods and all that. But if you go to crypto, you see like a billion dollar blockchain, that's really kind of worthless. You see that a lot. And that's what you're comparing Ergo to when truth or a multi billion dollar ERC 20 token.

[52:21] **CW**: There you go. Has absolutely zero utility and has nothing in it. Yeah.

[52:25] **qx()**: I was asking, I was asking kushti after the AMA, I was like, kushti, please tell me you have like a fucking cat or something that I can put in a fucking meme and put out on Twitter. He's like, no, no, I used to have a cat. I was like, that doesn't do me fucking good. No, no.

[53:01] **Dan Friedman**: I have a wolf. I have a wolf. I let him wander. I don't have a cat. I have a wolf. He lives. He lives in my house in Siberia.

[53:13] **CW**: It's gotta be a husky surely.

[53:16] **Dan Friedman**: His name is Quantum or something.

[53:19] **Quokka**: Quantum raises my children. I let them take care of my kids in the back.

[53:24] **Dan Friedman**: He was the original Sigmanauts.

[53:28] **qx()**: But on all seriousness, guys, that's the reason I'm in Ergo. Specifically because it's the only thing that stands out to me as something that's serious in that nature, that there's a problem that it wants to solve that's more than just pumping somebody's bags, pumping somebody's pockets.

And I'm saying that as somebody who does speculate a little bit in their head, and will appreciate when Ergo fucking moons at some point hopefully and doesn't rip that point out because this will be on the Ergo account but but yeah of course I want Ergo to go up in price of course I am invested in Ergo but at the same time I'm backing a project that I believe has real world usage is founded on solid fucking principles and we just saw the the SEC filing today right going after the latest fucking thing what was it on...

Charging that company for swapping. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I ran it through ChatGPT. I was talking to Joe about and I ran it through ChatGPT and I said, you know, give me a summary of this and tell me how this will affect proof of stake and tell me how this will affect proof of work.

Even ChatGPT couldn't find any really good thing of how it would affect Ergo and proof of work there. I mean, Ergo is built for as Joe says, and as other people say, it's fucking built for war. I mean, this is what it is. You can run a node on a goddamn refrigerator for fuck's sake. You know, you have a you have a permissionless mixer, you know, it's what are they gonna either gonna fucking take down GitHub to remove the mixer.

And even with that, you know, you could program the mixer to do some intricate smart contract hops where it funnels part of the funds out each time to make it even more hard to kind of track. You know and do fifty of those hops before it ends to something, you know, is the SEC going to require CEXes to look back a hundred fucking transactions, you know, networking through wallets to make sure you didn't swap it. No, you know, so this shit's built for war, you know, and it's it's permissionless. So I don't think anything else really is, you know, in the front of my mind. That's like that with them.

[55:29] **Quokka**: Like before the call we said the real vindication is when every other cryptocurrency kind of fails because they're not sufficiently decentralized enough that's it's not about price for me at this point and I say that after three years of down all right I don't give a shit about pricing at this point you know yeah but yeah and the cool thing of and this is one thing I've always said about the Ergo community it always attracts a like-minded person.

[55:56] **CW**: So if you look at people, you know, everyone's got their different opinions and all that sort of stuff. But their core sort of belief in the reasoning why they are here is for a number of the reasons that you both have just mentioned. And that's where you have that.

And I guess it's some sort of an unwavering sort of conviction within Ergo, you know, price doesn't matter. If you hear that around there, and people invest their hard earned and things like that, and they want to see a return on that, obviously, but the end of the day, they're here for a right reason and that's one thing I love about the community here.

[56:30] **qx()**: There's a word for that. There's a word for that and it's called fanaticism. The funny thing is I actually check, I actually check myself once in a while. I sit down and think, am I just being a fucking fanatic? Am I, do I have wool over my eyes? Am I drinking the Kool-Aid? And I have to sit and really check myself once in a while and be like, why am I here? What am I looking for?

And then I think, you know, back to the unstoppable medicine built for war. somebody could come in and ban all cryptocurrency and arrest kushti, you know, arrest us for promoting it arrest people who maybe they think made the mixer. It doesn't fucking matter. Ergo still gonna fucking take away. And that's the fucking crux of the issue right there. Not the issue, but the crux of the matter. It's going to be here no matter what. And it's going to be standing when everything else falls.

[57:21] **Dan Friedman**: You can be, you can be the Donald Trump of Ergo. Do you like that title with Donald Trump of Ergo?

[57:57] **qx()**: That's the grassroots marketing that we make sure there's an Ergo logo tattooed right on my forehead. Yeah.

[58:04] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Just make sure it's like backwards to that, you know, it translates the right way.

[58:11] **qx()**: Yeah. No regrets.

[58:16] **Dan Friedman**: You'll have, yeah. It's all like, it's all like...

[59:08] **CW**: Yeah, I think that we'll wrap that up here. It's been an awesome conversation and touching on a couple of cool subjects and reminiscing about things that have happened in the past. And we just briefly touched on where we see Ergo going in the future.

And I think it's in pretty good hands within the community and the people developing and things like that. So yeah, I'm excited. So it'll be interesting to see where it goes. And then also, just like to say, make mention that, you know, kushti's got the conversation coming up on the five yearly forecast of where he sees Ergo going and the development plan and things like that. So yeah, very bright future here at Ergo.

[59:47] **qx()**: Yeah, that's on July 1 at 4pm UTC. And then there's another one on July 2 at 4pm UTC that we invited all the devs to and community devs and Sigmanauts. So hopefully those are two big spaces. The one on the first is with Nervos and Alephium, you know, kind of piggybacking piggybacking, but showing that Ergo has that spirit of kind of cross chain collaboration, and all that kind of stuff right from the core members. So that's really cool to see.

[60:15] **CW**: Yeah.

[60:18] **Dan Friedman**: All right, guys, any last comments? Yeah, you know what? We're going to keep building away on Ergo and let's just do it. Let's build on Ergo. Let's not watch Ergo. Let's build on it.

Then when I then when I see you in Vegas, you're going to be subsequently roped into paying for breakfast that IHOP for everybody.

[61:28] **qx()**: I guess I'll have to be a bottom in Vegas. My bad.

[61:31] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah, yeah, you're just gonna be like, and you can't be like, too far, too far. And it's like, I'm like, yo, yo, it's too far, man. It's way too far. I'm like, no, it's not too far. Come down. And then he's like, bam, 100 bucks.

[61:46] **qx()**: They're texting me. I'm like I text Dan in the morning in Vegas and he's I'm like, hey, where are you? We're gonna go to IHOP he's like, yeah, we're there. We've already ordered I'm like, oh cool, which IHOP he sends me the pin. It's like not the IHOP that's like six blocks away It's a fucking IHOP that's a mile and a half away in Vegas. I'm like great Dan.

[62:03] **Dan Friedman**: I'll be done fucking 45 minutes Wow, it's it's almost like you had to you had to trek with a backpack.

[62:14] **qx()**: All right. I'm glad I asked any last comments. The rails are done.

[62:21] **CW**: Yeah. All right, guys. Thanks very much. It's been an insightful conversation. I loved every moment on it. It's had a great time. So, yeah, we hope that you enjoy the rest of the anniversary content that people are putting out. And yeah, have a good time. This is Hash It Out with Dan, Quokka, myself and qx(). Have a good one.

[62:40] **qx()**: Ciao, everybody. Peace.
