[00:22] **Dan Friedman**: Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey! It's the Ergo AMA and you know who this is. Well this is Dan, right? So I'm back in Japan. I am your man with the Ergo merch like a fan.

[00:45] **Dan Friedman**: And I guess I ran out of stuff that I can rhyme with Dan, so I'll hand it over to qx(), who is a man.

[00:57] **Dan Friedman**: And oh, well, excuse me, sir. You shifted your way. But that's all right. Oh, you're not qx(). You're like qx(). You're confusing me. First, half of you is gone. Then you're Alex. Oh, there is Alex. There he is. All right.

[01:27] **qx()**: I can keep rhyming, Dan, if you want to.

[01:32] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah, but I think Alex is in outer space right now. That's what I think.

[01:37] **qx()**: He's in the Tesla that got sent to space, I think.

[01:41] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah. But isn't that one with like a roadster?

[01:45] **qx()**: It's got no top. How are you doing, Alex? How are you doing, Dan?

[01:47] **kushti**: Yeah. So hello everyone. My pleasure to be again on the AMA and yeah, don't miss the spaces tomorrow. The first reminder for the community. So yeah, it will be spaces tomorrow.

[02:03] **qx()**: It's today, Alex.

[02:06] **kushti**: Spaces. Oh, fifth, is it today?

[02:10] **qx()**: Yeah, buddy, it's today.

[02:12] **kushti**: Oh, my bad actually. Yeah, but what time then? So yeah, I thought like last time it was on Friday. Okay. All right. So yeah, don't miss the spaces today. So qx() invited all the developers, right? Including even some themed. So yeah. But he will release them, you know, right?

[02:43] **Dan Friedman**: You know, qx(), see what you did. You confused even kushti.

[02:47] **qx()**: I did. I went by his dates, though. So I don't know.

[02:54] **Dan Friedman**: Pretty messed up because kushti's a smart guy. So he's difficult to confuse and you confused him. That's okay. That's my - I'm confused by a hairdo. Shouldn't you like be wearing a hat that's slightly tilted sideways?

[03:09] **qx()**: You know, I went to put on a hat today, Dan, and my wife said, don't wear a hat. It's a good hair day. So I kept my, I kept it on for you. I figured you'd be here in the AMA, Dan.

[03:18] **Dan Friedman**: Oh, well, that's adorable. Yeah.

[03:22] **qx()**: Tell us about your life. It's been like a month or two since you've been on.

[03:26] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah, it's been so much more than happened. Well, yeah, I ate food and I went to different places and I slept at night sometimes and now I'm back and that happened. Yeah. Many things like that. Now I know, I actually, it's been, yeah, I've been away for quite a bit of time and I mean, it's just been like nonstop travel.

[04:01] **Dan Friedman**: So I don't know if, have I done one since I've been back from Argentina?

[04:06] **qx()**: I don't think so.

[04:07] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah, yeah. So the one, the first trip that I was on was back in July.

[04:13] **qx()**: That was a lithium trip, right?

[04:16] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah, yeah, that's right. So it was to Argentina to kind of get into tokenizing lithium on Palmyra. Which went really well. And so we're working towards that right now. It's going to be very exciting because there's quite a bit of volume that actually is already being done with lithium trading in general.

[04:39] **Dan Friedman**: And we have an end with some really key lithium producers. And the good thing about lithium is that there is no problem with demand. There's actually something like some ridiculous amount. There's like 20 times more demand than incoming supply. So it's literally any time you mine lithium, it's already bought. You have no problem. It doesn't sit around. You can always sell it, which is really good because that means that the actual commodity we're not going to have to deal with. They're not really going to have to deal with sales too much, but we're actually starting from the other side.

[05:25] **Dan Friedman**: We're starting from the production, the mining side, so that we can assign traceability, assign tokenization to it for more transparency, for more opportunities. Basically, the tokenization that's going to happen is most likely going to be a security token offering and also a commodity token. So both will happen. We're still kind of figuring out exactly what the mechanics behind this are.

[05:58] **Dan Friedman**: But like I said, this is going to be quite exciting because the volume is going to be on Ergo. And so this is going to bring quite a bit of volume to Ergo because, like I said, there is no problem with moving this stuff. It's literally always, as long as you have it, it always moves. And we're actually right now talking to one of the largest mining companies in Argentina about working together on that.

[06:32] **Dan Friedman**: So that was a really great trip. I'm going to be back in Argentina in October to continue the conversation to, well, not just the conversation, but to continue the business and also visit the mining provinces. So there are several provinces in Argentina that are specific for lithium mining. I'm going to be visiting those provinces in particular and working with local governments to, again, onboard them onto the platform, get credentials going, get all these things happening. Like I said, quite a bit of exciting movement.

[07:13] **Dan Friedman**: After that, of course, I came back home for a week and then went to Las Vegas and shared an apartment with qx(). I will never be the same again after that. I still haven't showered enough.

[07:34] **qx()**: You're locking your door in your bedroom at night?

[07:36] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah, I still am. I still have that trauma.

[07:40] **qx()**: It happens.

[07:43] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah. Well, but Vegas was actually, I think this time it was actually a lot more productive than before, at least from our end. Plus there were quite a few people interested in Rosen, we got some in the Sigmanauts. We got a bunch of merch out. I still have a bunch of my Sigmanauts merch. Somebody actually stole one of my sweaters. I don't know who. Probably his name is probably not qx(), although it probably is.

[08:18] **Dan Friedman**: What are you going to do with that sweater? It's like you and your wife can wear it and you'll still have room left. There was a sweater, you know, somebody gave me a sweatshirt and it just disappeared. It was like right there. I'm pretty sure you snagged it.

[08:34] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah. But you know, I got my Ergo T-shirt, I got my Ergo sweater and you know, the good thing about that was after Vegas, I actually ended up going to Canada to see Luca.

[08:54] **qx()**: Did you bestow on him some merch?

[08:54] **Dan Friedman**: I bestowed the merch on me because it was freezing because Montreal was freaking cold, man. So it was a good thing that I had the sweater because I was like, what the hell am I going to do with the sweater? Because it was what? Like 100 degrees in Las Vegas.

[09:09] **qx()**: And then, yeah, something like that.

[09:12] **Dan Friedman**: And then I would go, I go to Montreal to see Luca and it's barely like 70 and miserable. It's raining outside and I didn't bring any pants. You know, I just brought like shorts with me because it was supposed to be a quick trip and I was, yeah, I was freezing man, but that sweater came in handy. So I did support Ergo merch in Canada, in Canadian.

[09:42] **qx()**: Fantastic.

[09:43] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah, so all those trips are really great. And like I said, I think Vegas was really good for us. I think we got a lot of new interest in Vegas. We had several of our community members come out. Mark the Shark was with us. Shishir was with us and mgPai, he also came out on his way back from Japan. Yeah, it was overall, I think it was really good.

[10:16] **qx()**: Yeah, you guys had a lot of interest in Palmyra there. You guys have very good name recognition in the community, for sure.

[10:22] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah, this is actually, this is really great to hear because, you know, it took quite a bit of time because like last, even last year, people still weren't, you know, they knew the Palmyra brand, but they didn't really know the Palmyra brand as much this year, really, you know, because we focused on Palmyra and people just knew the brand. We had our own merch. I don't know if some of you might've seen it on socials, Keep Palm and Tokenize RWAs. Those are the t-shirts that you got if you signed up for the Palmyra newsletter.

[11:03] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah, so that was good. Actually, this t-shirt right here, if some of you recall, this is actually from our Austin meetup. And that was a really nice meetup. It was really good. It was a good time. You know, we got, we had over like 120 people show up. I actually think that that was the main event that got, you know, obviously the Cardano community is a lot more bullish on Ergo than they were even like two years ago, right? So there's a lot more people involved.

[11:41] **Dan Friedman**: There's, you know, and then obviously it's not just because of the meetup, it was because of and because of the different things that are happening in the ecosystem. And we already had, of course, Cardano people in the Ergo community, but I really think that at that meetup, we definitely added people to the community. I think that people that weren't or kind of were curious about Ergo really became bullish on Ergo during that meetup. And I think they stayed in the community and they've been following through on...

[12:14] **Dan Friedman**: Did you turn from good to evil right now, qx()? What happened?

[12:18] **qx()**: It's synced with my emotions. When was the Austin meetup, Dan? When was that?

[12:23] **Dan Friedman**: That wasn't '21? Or was it '22? No, I think it was '22. Yeah, I think it was '22-ish. I don't know.

[12:35] **qx()**: So when things pick back up again, don't forget, we've got an open invite to Colorado. Joe's got a building there that we can use for a meetup.

[12:44] **Dan Friedman**: Joe's got a mountain there.

[12:46] **qx()**: Well, I don't know if he wants to invite people to his private mountain, Dan, but he does have a community building in town that he's opening up.

[12:56] **Dan Friedman**: Oh, I see. I'm glad to see that that made you happy and bright.

[13:02] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah, well, that's really sweet.

[13:06] **qx()**: So I saw Chef was working with an olive oil farmer.

[13:12] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah, that's right. Farmers.

[13:15] **qx()**: Wow, so that's tokenizing olive oil. So because I understand that olive oil is stricken with a lot of counterfeiting, right? They'll mix it with crappy stuff and ship it off kind of thing. So how does your tokenization, you know, ensure or help with that kind of pureness of the olive oil market in the corruption that's there?

[13:38] **Dan Friedman**: Well, basically, olive oil is in high demand. Oh, I see parts of me. Wow, okay. I think kushti went kaleidoscopical again.

[13:58] **kushti**: Yeah, because otherwise I have to hold the device all the time and it's bad.

[14:08] **qx()**: No worries, because your picture looks nice.

[14:12] **Dan Friedman**: Alex, you do know they have invented these things called phone holders for your car. So you could potentially utilize that technology.

[14:25] **kushti**: Not often I am doing calls in a car, to be honest.

[14:31] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah, well, you know, we are not the same because I literally, my last call that I did right before this was from the car. So, you know, I like your life better though. I don't like taking calls from the car. It's just, it's like, the car is my private time to think about all the bad things I've done. And, you know, it's just take and call it anyway. But, you know, business is business. What are you going to do?

[14:59] **qx()**: You're driving from New York to California, Dan? That's probably going to take a while to pass through all that drama.

[15:07] **Dan Friedman**: No, I was driving from Eastern Osaka to Shigenowate.

[15:14] **qx()**: Tell us about the olive oil.

[15:16] **Dan Friedman**: So let's get back into the olive oil. Again, really cool because we're going to really get to dig into the traceability part with it and to really utilize all these different great things with Winter Protocol on Ergo. And so basically one of the issues with Greek olive oil and well olive oil but especially Greek olive oil is that Greek olive oil is a hot commodity but there's actually quite a bit of counterfeiting going on out there.

[15:55] **Dan Friedman**: In fact, a story that Theo has is that he went to a supermarket in Canada and saw Greek olive oil on the shelf, and he was happy. I mean, he's a chef, right? So he was happy. He wanted to get some Greek olive oil. He brings it back home, tastes it. And he knows, I mean, you know, obviously, especially a chef, a professional chef knows what Greek olive oil tastes like. It's different, right? So different olives have different have a different flavor. And he knew that this was definitely not Greek olive oil, even though it said it was Greek olive oil.

[16:34] **Dan Friedman**: This is not an isolated problem. This is quite an extensive problem out there with just brands saying that it's Greek olive oil, but how do you know?

[16:51] **qx()**: Maybe the owner's name has the word Greek in it.

[16:56] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah, I mean, look, so what that creates is actually a high demand for a Greek olive oil that can be verified as Greek olive oil. And so this is what we're doing. So we're actually working directly with Greek olive oil producers and just Greek olives that are meant for Greek olive oil, putting them on Palmyra and tokenizing them and then tracking and tracing them to go directly to the buyer so that the buyer doesn't have to be concerned with, is this really Greek olive oil?

[17:32] **Dan Friedman**: They don't have to go with the trust me bro ethos or have to develop these long-term, well, I mean, we want them to develop long-term relationships, but not these relationships where it takes them a while to develop trust. Because you should be able to use the system so that you don't have to develop, so you don't have to really trust the producer because you can just check the data on chain and make sure that you know, the olive oil that they are being sold is the real deal?

[18:10] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah, so just it really solves a lot. Yeah, I even okay. You're thinking evil thoughts right now, aren't you?

[18:17] **qx()**: Yeah. It's hard to compartmentalize this early in the morning, you know.

[18:22] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah, it's at morning is it's, you know, but an hour till midnight right now.

[18:28] **qx()**: So how long, how long are we looking till they'll start using, you know, the product, the Winter Protocol, all that kind of stuff?

[18:36] **Dan Friedman**: That's alpha that's actually going to come out in the next few weeks. We will let the community know when Greek olive oil is going to be available on the platform. And we believe there's going to, is going to be a big deal. And there's also going to be other campaigns that we're going to be running that are going to be directly, you know, aimed at the community so that they can participate in Palmyra.

[19:07] **Dan Friedman**: So, yeah, that's it in a nutshell.

[19:09] **qx()**: I look forward to you bringing some samples of olive oil to the next conference so I can give a couple away.

[19:19] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah, yeah, but listen, we already got some requests here. We definitely need to do another Ergo meetup. The last one was actually in Istanbul, Turkey last year, and that was actually a really nice one. What happened to qx()? Come back.

[19:39] **kushti**: All right. Then by the way, are you going to Dubai in October, late October?

[19:46] **Dan Friedman**: That's right, I am going to be in Dubai in October for the Cardano Summit.

[19:51] **kushti**: Cardano Summit, it's all the same. And actually, there will be a lot of events around in late October. So I've gotten invites even to talk at Cosmoverse, but yeah, I don't really know what to talk about there because I know nothing about Cosmos these days. Then, yeah, there will be Cardano Summit and there will be some Bitmain conference in Abu Dhabi, just around the same dates as Cardano Summit.

[20:27] **Dan Friedman**: Well, I think that actually it might be, I mean, we were talking about it last year, qx(), you seem so small. Or is it just because your head grew more and you don't fit in the frame?

[20:39] **qx()**: That's what it is. Yeah, like the Grinch my heart grew ten times.

[20:45] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah, your heart. Yeah, that's right. It's your heart. Yeah, definitely your heart. I think that we should this year - I mean we spoke about it last year talked about doing an Ergo summit or an Ergo meetup in Dubai and actually we did do one.

[21:01] **qx()**: I thought you did, yeah.

[21:01] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah, but I think that we can do a bigger and better one. And in fact, maybe, and I can't promise anything, but Charles will be there, so we might even get him to come hang out with us again at this meetup. But we'll figure it out. We'll talk about it some more. And I think there's going to be quite a few people in Dubai that are also Ergo community people.

[21:29] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah, it might be good. We just need to really kind of think about what it's going to be about. And we're going to have to, I want to have a theme for it. You know, something that's very much Ergo-related, promoting the tech. Maybe have, you know, maybe, I guess, do something that's Rosen-themed or Dexy Gold-themed or something. Something interesting. Yeah. So let's definitely discuss it and see what we can do.

[21:57] **kushti**: Yeah, well, we can also do another podcast with Charles, right? We could do that. Since the last one already, like two and a half years past, right? So a lot of new things to talk about.

[22:17] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah. And actually Charles is going to be in Japan next week. So I'm going to see him and we're going to spend some time together. He's going to come to Osaka as well. And hopefully we're going to host him at the Palmyra office. And qx(), you're half the man you used to be like in that old Nirvana song.

[22:45] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah, yeah, and so we'll talk about, and I think, yeah, I mean, if schedule allows, he's always happy to participate in some, you know, in an Ergo AMA or an Ergo video so we can all do a video again, I think. Well, in fact, you know, I can negotiate it. Hey, half face, you know, two face. Go back.

[23:12] **kushti**: Do we have records issues all the time?

[23:17] **Dan Friedman**: Well, your video keeps coming on and off. So I think Andy is confused.

[23:24] **qx()**: All right. Give me some core exercises.

[23:28] **kushti**: Yeah. I will try to call this device all the time. Yeah. It's not super convenient. All right. So, yeah, so development as usual and yeah that is based on the development more or less so what's going on so what I've been focused with what I witnessed so yeah well in the first place 6.0.

[24:05] **kushti**: First DevNet is out like one week ago, right? And well, in one week there will be another DevNet. Then third one and yeah, after that we can do release candidates or to be close to mainnet release. Yeah, that's for Sigma 6.0. So for new features in contractual interpreter and yeah, the current DevNet was requested by Lithos guys and already used by Lithos and she has actually promised to do a forum post on how it's used and what contracts the Lithos will be based on.

[24:51] **kushti**: Well, working also on sub-blocks now a little bit more and I think actually in a few weeks we can have some rough DevNet with peer-to-peer network based on sub-blocks for block transactions propagation. We can start testing performance. The goal is to achieve the maximum performance which is achievable by classic proof-of-work cryptocurrency with commodity hardware. So the setting will stay on. Well, the classic flat peer-to-peer network setting not like what some data center-based, well, quasi-blockchains are doing now, right?

[25:50] **kushti**: So then, yeah, well, contributions are much welcomed. Well, like scripts for load testing, start-on-proxy modification, and yeah, writing scripts with new features for 6.0 testing, all that stuff. Yeah, so good news from pgr456. He's doing Explorer work for the Sigmanauts Explorer instance. And actually I'm thinking to propose to Ergo Foundation to support this. So we need to get better explorers.

[26:37] **kushti**: Then what else? mgPai is working on Keystone, right? And at Ergo Foundation we are going to support this with some kind of grants. So that's also been discussed right now.

[26:59] **qx()**: kushti, can you... Oh, Dan, yeah, don't tell Dan that you're taking one of his men. kushti, what's the difference, Keystone and Ledger? Keystone's more open-sourced than Ledger, is that my understanding, the difference between the two?

[27:11] **kushti**: Yeah, so it's more verifiable, right, and yeah, more open, and yeah, more true in some regards, right, so they're actually trying to do their best to be fully open and verifiable. So, well, a really good spirit there. I do not like Ledger these days. But yeah, so for Ledger, as far as I know, there is a request now to do some audit, right? And some done by some friendly company, friendly to Ledger. So I don't really know what's going on there. So here folks are working on that, right? So maybe, you know, better than. But yeah, so something is going on, hopefully, right, to get on Ledger as well.

[28:15] **kushti**: But yeah, so Keystone is, I mean, to me at least better, right, because of the spirit at least, and the attempts to be, well, transparent and better in terms of security, right. Right. All right. So yeah, I personally would buy some after Ergo support will be done. And yeah, but why I was asked about Dubai then? So we need to bring T-shirts to the town, right? Because there will be a lot of people around like Cardanians, Cosmo people and ordinary crypto public in general a lot of people in Dubai so yeah we need to bring a lot of t-shirts.

[29:14] **kushti**: Well t-shirts we shall have. Right yeah so yeah so the development is going on as usual that's a full steam mode.

[29:27] **Dan Friedman**: That's very good to hear. So what about you, qx()? What have you been getting going on up to in, except for not paying your light bill?

[29:42] **qx()**: Yeah, I know, right? Let's see. So exciting news about the Sigmanauts mining pool. Cheats has had on our testnet, he's had storage rent going strong for a good week and a half now on testnet. So that's really awesome. We have plans this weekend to get some tea and do a Zoom call and upgrade the mainnet test server. And so that means that we've asked for volunteers from the current Sigmanauts mining DAO to point some hash to mainnet for storage rent collection.

[30:21] **qx()**: And we've got about 28 gigahash out of our pool that are going to point. That should give us maybe a block a day and maybe a block and a half, two blocks a day. So that'll be very exciting. As soon as that's up, we'll spread the word to our DAO and they'll repoint and hopefully we can start seeing some storage rent rolling in to that pool. Once that gets done and we feel comfortable, we will then have Mark the Shark upgrade the actual new pool that he moved to on a new server and then all our hash will point to that and we will officially be the first full pool to implement storage rent on mainnet. Super, super exciting. So that's this weekend, I hope.

[31:04] **qx()**: What else is in the system? Cyberverse did a car mint on Cardano. Super, super cool. I always love their minting transaction views animations. The Gen 3 animation was super cool. This mint is pretty cool. If you're an Ergo person only, let me move now that kushti disconnected. There we go. If you're an Ergo person only, you can connect a Cardano wallet. And if you have a few ADAs in there, you can then mint a car right with your ADA. I think I had like 150 or 180 spare ADA kicking around in one of my wallets. So I just connected that to my Cyberverse account and minted two cars. It was super cool, super fun. And I think Kilver just said that he just bought a rare Cardano mint car off of the J-Pink store. So that was pretty cool as well. Banner in both windows. That's fantastic.

[31:56] **qx()**: What else? MewFinance opens on the 9th I believe from what I read and he announced today that he has P2P escrow trading so that means you can specifically bundle items together in a package and only give permissions to a certain address to take it if the price is right this kind of thing. So super super cool there currently that was only really done with I believe at the bank, I think, right? What the hell is it called? The SigmaUSD Bank site. And that was even limited there.

[32:42] **qx()**: All right, we also have Sigmanauts moderation document. Went over some review over the weekend and in chats. There's some comments that I have to smush down and integrate into the document. But once that's done, I will put out the vote and we will start enforcing some community standards. Oh, now it's just me, Dan. Dan, you are trouble. You are trouble, sir.

[33:07] **qx()**: And once that's done, that'll be great. Then we can start enforcing standards, making sure everybody is held accountable for best community practices as far as that goes. Nautilus has TX history. Super damn cool. Everybody's been wanting that for a long time. So you'll see, and I don't think it's in the Canary build yet. I didn't check though. But you'll see a fifth tab, I believe it is, right in the middle on the new build when it comes out. That will allow you to view all your TX history. So that's nice to see instead of having people go to explore or explore and have to fish through it and figure out how to translate that it should be nice and pretty in that view.

[33:55] **qx()**: The raffle for Gluon SDK that is around 30% filled, but there's only six days left. I think we've got over 5,000 ERGs left to help fund it. That's a fairly important endeavor to get that out there so that we can really, you know, Gluon can really provide kind of an open interface for people to work with with that SDK. So that kind of stuff's, you know, while it might not be understood by the general public, it's super important for all that kind of stuff. I think that's it and kushti's back fantastic dan you're out of the frame now.

[34:25] **Dan Friedman**: You gotta move back. No, it's that's me over there.

[34:31] **qx()**: That's your teddy bear. That's how you felt after Vegas. That's me in the corner being hugged so much. That's me in the spotlight losing my religion. Great. All right, we got any questions?

[34:43] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah, we do. We do. We have a couple of questions here. Oh, well, Luke Gray Smith, always with a good one. So what does the crystal ball say about Ergo node 7.X? What do the next few years look like for Ergo and the crypto space at large? So maybe who wants to tackle this one? qx(), Alex, who wants to do this one?

[35:11] **qx()**: And I think Luke wrote Ergo node 7.x. Is that a different model of Ergo node?

[35:18] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah. Ergo nodes. Yeah. So what does a crystal ball say about Ergo nodes? Are we going to do Ergo nodes? I hope not.

[35:27] **kushti**: No, I don't know. 7.0 for the next version after 6.0. So the plan of mine at least currently well is to see how 6.0 will work out and maybe to focus on some refactoring to support sidechains, side chain constructions like and side chain launches but yeah that's mostly about some evolutionary work and not many soft works will be required.

[36:16] **kushti**: And yeah, in regards with updates, Sigma 6.0 would require a soft fork and the sub-blocks is just a velvet fork update, so it should be a very soft, the softest one probably. So it's just peer-to-peer, no, not just peer-to-peer, so yeah, I mean, miners would need to update at some point. So yeah, it's kind of soft, but yeah, very soft actually. Only miners do need to update.

[36:59] **kushti**: After that, the plan is to do some research to see how things work out. There is a lot of research around. I'm now tracking a lot of new things in cryptography. I'm currently catching up with some developments. Let's see. And actually, yeah, it's only about cryptography now, so for peer-to-peer network and so on. So it seems already optimal solutions are known. So let's see. And in cryptography, we will see a lot of breakthroughs for years to come. So yeah, let's see.

[37:52] **qx()**: You said something about, you said something in chat about sub-blocks today that you're digging in and you're thinking about timings, the TPS research.

[38:03] **kushti**: Yeah, so initial DevNets would be based on the current 5.x code base probably. Now then, yeah, it can be rebased for 6.0. That's not an issue. The idea is to check it all together. Probably 6.0 would be needed because there would be a need to add a new parameter for miners to readjust. Miners can readjust block size and so on. I'm thinking to do sub-blocks per block. Well, the average number is also adjustable. Miners can actually do faster transport if the network is long for that.

[39:16] **Dan Friedman**: So what about you, qx(), what do you think about this? What do you think about Ergo nodes?

[39:23] **qx()**: You know, I think we have a spaces coming up, not today, not today's spaces. Today's spaces are more serious discussion, but in a week on the 25th, no, on the, no, on the 5th, 12th, I think it is next week, we have a spaces about mnematics. And that kind of stuff. So I think that's a great opportunity to talk about what that kind of stuff means to a serious chain. I mean you have - I mean every chain likes to think they're a serious chain, right? But of course they have these layers on top that do that kind of stuff. So yeah, I think that's a good discussion to have there at that time.

[40:09] **Dan Friedman**: All right, all right, okay. All right, let's see. So let me ask you something, qx(), as long as we're talking about the future, the not too distant future. And we kind of spoke about this in Vegas, I guess. You know, the Sigmanauts are kind of trying and OK, so kind of rewind a little bit where, you know, just kind of give you an understanding where my thought process is. So if some of you are following Cardano, there's quite a bit of, you know, governance talk, autonomy, right, kind of a bigger plunge into decentralization.

[41:13] **Dan Friedman**: And I've always respected Sigmanauts and organizations like Sigmanauts within Ergo because it's an autonomous organization within a decentralized ecosystem like Ergo that is doing their stuff. And so the Sigmanauts are kind of trying their own thing, right? So you're kind of trying these different things. You had initiatives. Oh, there I go again on my own. Anyway, you guys, oh, there I am. Okay. I was about to do hand puppets. And, you know, the Sigmanauts, you guys did what you, you did the merge, right? So you had a vote on Paideia. And then, you know, in my mind, I always say Paideia. Yeah. And then, field does it in a very Greek proper way. And I could ever say it like that. But whatever, you know what I mean.

[42:05] **Dan Friedman**: So you decided to do the merge, right? So that did some things, right? So what, I mean, what's next? I mean, like, what do you, well, first of all, let me ask you this. What is the Sigmanauts roadmap, say for the next year or something?

[42:23] **qx()**: What is it? So you see, so people should look at Cardano and see the order of operations here. So what Cardano did is they essentially developed a monetary system where there's a funding system in place, right? So they have Catalyst, they have a treasury, they have those kinds of things already built. And then they're building the community on top of that. So I mean, that's a smart way to go, of course. The Sigmanauts have to do that the opposite way, unfortunately. The Sigmanauts have to build a community and then slowly we have to find funding options and ways to fund it.

[42:58] **qx()**: That's what you see with the developer DAO, hopefully with the Good Things DAO as well at some point when we get back on track with that. So we have to develop a strong community of strong individuals that, you know, support our mission, support the mission of Ergo, support their mission, essentially, if they're part of it. And on top of that, we have to develop funding options. So that's really what I've been pushing super, super hard lately.

[43:25] **qx()**: Right now, we're waiting for Four Eyes to finish SigmaLock. When SigmaLock is finished, hopefully that will also coincide with about the time that Sky Harbor releases their front-end UI and their new smart contracts. So the idea is that we have a roadmap right now of revenue exploration or revenue discovery. The first one is Sigmanauts Mining DAO. As I said before, Mark's moving to another server, which should allow us to make some profits as well as pay some of the people that are actually working on it.

[44:01] **qx()**: Two is SigmaLock. Three is the Sky Harbor front end being taken over and powered by the Sigmanauts once that's released. And four, the final one, which is the most difficult, is M4L messaging. And all these, hopefully, the either UI fee or the mining transaction fee with M4L messaging, things like that, a percentage of that will go to the Sigmanauts. So then slowly, we can start building up some sort of treasury. Because we can't always just ask for money from the EF. We can't. They're not going to be around forever as far as the treasury goes, depending on what they do for revenue streams.

[44:33] **qx()**: So we really have to be self-sufficient and self-sustaining as kushti knows with the things he's done as well as a developer DAO. But that's our roadmap. So I think it's the opposite of what Cardano did. We've developed a very strong community. And the benefit to that is you have players inside the community that are not dissing how Cardano did it. You have benefits of the Ergo method that we've done here that we've had to be required to do because that's what it is.

[45:08] **qx()**: The benefit is the people that are here want to be here, not because there's a lot of money in the treasury and not because we have a ton of money to spend, but because they have a vision and a shared vision of the purpose and intent of what Ergo is and what it does. So then we build off the top of that. And we find revenue sources based on that and with those principles and we move forward. I think that provides a very strong foundation. So that's essentially where we are. Sigmanauts' main mission right now is to continue to grow the community and bring revenue streams in.

[45:42] **qx()**: The immediate not so far mission is to break into more subgroups. I think that's the most efficient with the way that I've experienced Ergo and the Ergo community. It's very hard to get a bunch of people together to agree on certain things and to push forward, especially in this ecosystem, especially Ergo. I mean, everybody's very special in Ergo, I should say very kindly. So what I found that might be helpful in something like the Sigmanauts group is to have kind of subgroups.

[46:13] **qx()**: And that is the mining DAO broke off to a mining DAO. So while they still kind of push funds back to the Sigmanauts as a main mission, they can also act autonomously. So if you don't like the main Sigmanauts group, then go to the mining DAO. Same thing's going to exist for when we take over at Sky Harbor front end. Same thing's going to exist for NFT. There's going to be a Sigmanauts NFT DAO, which bolsters the NFT community, which upholds it, which pushes it forward, which does all those kind of checks and balances. So if you don't like the main group or the DAO mining group, you go to the Sigmanauts NFT DAO. Same kind of thing across the board.

[46:51] **qx()**: So we'll have a treasury DAO. We'll have all that kind of stuff. That'll be a subdivision of that. We've got a treasury person. Hopefully he's watching. He came to Vegas with Mark. His name is Jake. I'm not sure if he came to the last meeting, but I wasn't there because of the US holiday. Hopefully we'll introduce him next week and we'll see if he's still interested in doing treasuring. So that was a big thing as well. All the treasury kind of stuff is here and there on a couple Google Docs. Some people edit it, some people don't. It's about finding those people that are passionate about it that will do those specific tasks and move forward. That's it in a nutshell, Dan.

[47:27] **qx()**: Essentially, revenue stream, keep bolstering the group, break off into sub-DAOs and keep growing those sub-DAOs and the main-DAO forward.

[47:41] **Dan Friedman**: Well, that's pretty DAO-tastic. I think, yeah, yeah, it sounds very interesting sounds very autonomic, autonomous. I like that. Decentralized autonomous. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Exactly decentralized autonomy.

[48:14] **kushti**: Yes. That sounds interesting and I proposed so pretty much the same to go DAO now, but yeah, well still discussing how to organize things there. So my idea is to have the model of so-called partial leadership, right, so when you have some small squads like maybe two to three people even, right, well they have some leader which is well and I know that this team is working on one direction only, right? And yeah, you have some joint conversation, but without, you know, one person involving in talks about everything. It's not efficient, kind of. So it's mostly about small teams. I guess we are targeting for high efficiency. So small targeted teams they wanted to deliver things.

[49:12] **qx()**: Yeah, I feel that in Ergo, at least, there's so much stuff to pick up and run with. We don't need to be fighting over, you know, over certain, even if opinions clash and personalities clash, which they're going to. There are so many things to do and pick up on and you can find your passion on that. We don't need to argue about, even in the case, if there's something that somebody wants to work on, let's say there's something that the Sigmanauts want to work on, and some people in the group disagree, some people agree, but there's enough of a consensus to move forward.

[49:47] **qx()**: Those people that disagreed it's permissionless. They can do they can group up themselves and and do a thing as part of another sub-Sigmanauts group or or their own Anti-Sigmanauts group. It doesn't matter. You know what I mean? That's the beauty of the system. Nobody's gonna look at you poorly or anything like that if you build something and it gets adoption then that's great. You know, so there's lots of opportunities for that and this kind of permissionless system.

[50:15] **kushti**: No, I mean, so it's rooted in the blockchain itself, right? So when it's permissionless, then yeah, I mean, everything on top of it as well. So you can have indeed groups, maybe you don't agree with or simply hate, right? Still there in the same financial space. So that's maybe not convenient to everyone, but yeah, that's how it works.

[50:45] **qx()**: Yeah, some people have a hard time getting their mind around that, but I try to preach that in the Sigmanauts at least. If you don't like what we're doing or if you don't like what the majority of us are doing, then it's permissionless. You don't have to ask us for permission. The only thing that we have to ask permission on is the votes in the DAO. So anything else you're welcome to do with a small group or on your own or anything, it's awesome. That's one of the things I love about Ergo.

[51:10] **kushti**: Yeah, and it's also about, I don't know, everything being open source, right? And not just open source, but being free, right? So, well, most of stuff I'm checking is under permissionless licenses, right? So you have a right to run it and modify it right without paying license fees or whatever right without a risk to be sued. Then yeah so it's kind of free rights kind of I don't know for financial genuine movement rights which resulted into Linux operating system and not only so yeah could be seen like that.

[51:59] **qx()**: Yeah, I love it. A great example is HQx and Aco just taking the Spectrum contracts and the UI and redoing it and making Crux Finance and lowering the fees because they can run it cheaper, I guess. So that kind of stuff is super cool and nobody's pissed about it. It's like, oh, cool. You did this, you did that. You have a product that you're supporting. That's awesome.

[52:22] **kushti**: Yeah, so that's kind of, yeah, truly like hacker culture, right? Well, well known from 80s, right? And from 70s, actually, so well, it led to appearance of personal computers. Well, as far as I know, so high personally, not that tall, so I didn't witness those times. But yeah, so it was about, I don't know, people who built first personal computers in places like a garage, basically. Then GNU, movements, Linux, early internet. All those places were, by spirit, pretty much like Ergo now, I believe.

[53:20] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah, I do. I do remember those early days. I was just thinking about actually the 80s today. I was thinking, you know, I don't remember the last time I did what we did in the 80s, which is basically just go somewhere without any mobile devices and do stuff and be completely cut off from the world as we now think of it. You know, I was thinking about, man, you know, I remember that when I was in third grade algebra, I was doing all the calculations by hand, but then I started using the calculator at home for homework.

[54:05] **Dan Friedman**: And I noticed that you know, long division and everything. I used to do this all by hand. And, but then I just started using the elevator, the elevator, the calculator. And I remember that I started thinking like, I'm getting lazy, you know, I'm getting lazy using the calculator because it would just, and then when I took it away, it was so much, you know, it just was kind of like, it was difficult to, to get back to doing it by hand.

[54:32] **Dan Friedman**: So, yeah, the early days of whatever, the IT revolution, the consumer IT revolution. Yeah, I think, I think Ergo is kind of there right now. You know, we, you know, we're the T92, not the T82, the T92. In a world of those calculators, the ones that you didn't even have the solar thing on them, you had to plug them in and they had the red readout numbers. Yeah, those. In a world of those calculators were the T92.

[55:21] **Dan Friedman**: And so, you know, and I guess just like in the back in those days, people just didn't know how to use the damn thing. But now it makes perfect sense, you know, just of course, you know, it's a graphing calculator that does all these different equations that you need, and it's got all the software just built into it. So I think, and I know there's better examples, but just that's what comes to mind for me kind of thinking about those days. That's how I think about Ergo.

[55:51] **Dan Friedman**: I think Ergo is just this powerhouse way ahead of its time with all these different functions and all these different goodies built in. But people are still stuck on the plug into the wall, little red numbers and a couple of functions calculators. And they look at this thing and they're like, oh my god, I don't even know how to hold it. If you guys remember the T92, it wasn't a standard upright calculator. It was like the panorama calculator. So yeah, we're the panorama calculator in the world of upright calculators.

[56:31] **Dan Friedman**: Anyway, I think that's enough metaphors for today. You know, Alex is having a shaky car day right now. But that sunroof makes a hell of a lot of difference, though. All right, so are we going to wrap up?

[56:46] **kushti**: So then, yeah, the folks don't miss today's spaces. So not tomorrow, but today. In two hours. In two hours. In two hours. Yeah, so we have spaces. And yeah, so then next week, Thursday also, right? 12th. qx().

[57:11] **qx()**: Yes, the 12th. Yeah, that's on mnemonics.

[57:15] **kushti**: Yeah, so it will be spaces on marketing, memetic warfare, rights. Yeah, let's discuss all the I don't know, non-technical aspects like marketing, ideological roots, memetic warfare, whatever, I mean, it's free to join and free to speak. I don't know, so for memetics, we can give a mic to everyone, right, who is willing to take, I guess, because, I mean, why to have other rules.

[57:57] **kushti**: And today it will be mostly about developers' project leaders' rights idea and so what I'm willing to get is what do they need and what are their thoughts on adoption for funding options and what do they need from libraries and the core protocol and so on. So the idea is to get feedback to listen to them and what they need.

[58:38] **kushti**: All right. So yeah, in two hours, let's discuss the state of the applications, the ecosystem and how to improve it.

[58:50] **kushti**: Perfect.

[58:54] **Dan Friedman**: All right. Well, I think that's a good place to leave it off for this week. A lot of fun stuff coming up. Lots of important spaces, development updates. I mean, I'm really excited. I think there's quite a bit of stuff happening. People are concerned with the numbers and everything, but I'm not you know, I think I think we got a lot going on I think we are moving in the right direction and this will all pay off. I think this will all pay off in the end.

[59:30] **Dan Friedman**: All right guys. Well, I think yep, we should leave it off for here for the for this week and so yeah next week same time same place same channel. And until then, this is Dan from Japan, barely alive, but still with you. Signing off.

[59:57] **qx()**: Ciao, everybody.

[60:00] **kushti**: Bye, everyone. See you in two hours.
