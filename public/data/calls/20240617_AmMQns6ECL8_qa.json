      "question": "What problems exist with the current Rosen Bridge fee structure for smaller transactions?",
      "asker": "Implied from presentation",
      "answer": "The Rosen Bridge has a high minimum fee of up to $10 for transactions below $2,000, and only offers the lower 0.5% fee rate for transactions above $2,000. This creates a barrier for smaller fund holders who want to bridge amounts like $50 or $100, where a $10 fee represents a significant percentage of their transaction.",

      "question": "How does Rosenport solve the high fee problem for small transactions?",
      "asker": "Implied from presentation",
      "answer": "Rosenport uses batch bridging to solve this issue. It allows multiple smaller transactions (like $75, $100, $200) to be batched together until they reach the $2,000 threshold, then uses the Rosen Bridge to execute the batch transfer. This way, everyone pays a significantly smaller fee instead of the flat $10 minimum.",

      "asker": "Implied from presentation",
      "answer": "No, Rosenport is not a competition against the Rosen Bridge, but rather a complementary system built on top of it. It leverages the existing Rosen Bridge infrastructure to execute the actual cross-chain transfers once batches reach the required threshold.",
