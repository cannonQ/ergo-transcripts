# Ergo Blockchain Community Call Summary
**Date:** 2025-06-26  
**Topic:** Pattern | Mehrdad | ErgoHack 10

## Executive Summary

Mehrdad presented Pattern, a new AI-powered agent designed to provide real-time blockchain insights through multiple data source connections. Pattern has been built as a modular, extensible system with connectors to various blockchain APIs, enabling users to fetch smart contract source code, invoke contract functions, pull transaction histories, and perform on-chain analytics. The presentation focused specifically on Pattern's integration with the Ergo ecosystem, which was developed as part of ErgoHack 10.

The demonstration showcased Pattern's capabilities through practical examples, including querying Ergo smart contracts, retrieving ErgoTree scripts, and analyzing wallet transactions. Users can access Pattern through mvp.pattern.global using Gmail or wallet authentication, making blockchain data analysis more accessible through natural language queries.
