# Ergo Community Call Summary - July 4, 2024

## Executive Summary

Alex Chepurnoy (kushti), founder of Ergo, delivered a comprehensive vision for the next five years of the Ergo blockchain during the Ergoversary Summit 2024. The presentation traced Ergo's evolution from its launch on July 1, 2019, through its current state as a growing DeFi ecosystem, to an ambitious future roadmap. Kushti outlined plans for significant protocol upgrades including Sigma 6.0, expanded cross-chain connectivity, sidechains development, and enhanced developer tooling.

The vision for 2029 positions Ergo as a "hyperconnected blockchain" seamlessly integrated with Bitcoin, Cardano, Ethereum, and other major networks, supported by a rich sidechains ecosystem and advanced DeFi infrastructure. Key upcoming developments include the mainnet launch of Lithos (November-December 2024), multiple new stablecoins (Dexy and Gluon), expanded bridge connections, and continued research into rollups, storage rent optimization, and novel monetary experiments.

## Key Discussion Points

• **Historical Progress**: Five-year journey from painful crypto winter launch to established DeFi ecosystem with ErgoMixer, Oracle Pools, SigmaUSD, Spectrum DEX, and Rosen Bridge
• **Current Ecosystem State**: Multiple stablecoins launching (Dexy, Gluon), diverse DEX options (Spectrum, TradingHouse, CrystalPool), lending platforms, and cross-chain bridges with Cardano and Bitcoin
• **Sigma 6.0 Protocol Upgrade**: New contracting layer features enabling more efficient rollups, trustless hash rate derivatives, and Bitcoin relay contracts
• **Cross-Chain Expansion**: Ethereum bridge imminent, followed by EVM chains, Bitcoin runes support, and connections to UTXO Alliance partners
• **Sidechains Development**: Research from ErgoHack 7 and 8 to be published, with trustless relay implementations and mainnet launches planned
• **Developer Tooling Improvements**: Better error reporting, debugging capabilities, potential high-level language support (ErgoLisp), and formal verification revival
• **Governance Evolution**: Three current organizations (Ergo Foundation, Sigmanauts DAO, ErgoDevs DAO) with potential for additional entities like Ergo Association or Ecosystem Fund
• **Mining Decentralization**: Lithos mainnet launch scheduled for November/December 2024, revival of Fair Initial Mining Offerings as alternative to airdrops

## Decisions Made

• Sigma 6.0 development is actively underway with focus on contracting layer improvements
• Storage rent discussions to resume in late 2024 (referencing EIP-45)
• Lithos mainnet launch targeted for November-December 2024
• Research publications planned for sidechain designs from recent ErgoHacks
• Need to establish formal rules for releases, security protocols, and research-driven development processes

## Notable Quotes

> "So we can imagine Ergo has hyperconnected blockchain are connected with external blockchains such as Bitcoin, Cardano, Nervos Ethereum and so on. Also with rich sidechains ecosystem with safest DeFi for users and also largely built for peer-to-peer interactions to be trustless and secure." - **kushti**

> "I really hope to see a revival of Fair initial mining offerings. So, well, it seems much better than just ordinary airdrops, which always messy you know a lot of cheating happens in about every airdrop a lot of insider games and so on." - **kushti**

> "It will bring value to the real world with tools, with stable pricing and elastic supply to fulfill the real world economy's needs. But, yeah, well, those tools would be based on high-quality digital assets, namely proof-of-work assets such as Ergo." - **kushti**
