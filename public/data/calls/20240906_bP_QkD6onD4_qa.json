      "question": "How does Palmyra's tokenization help with olive oil counterfeiting and authentication?",
      "asker": "qx()",
      "answer": "Olive oil, especially Greek olive oil, faces extensive counterfeiting where products are mislabeled as Greek olive oil when they're not. Palmyra works directly with Greek olive oil producers to tokenize their products and track them through the entire supply chain using Winter Protocol on Ergo. This allows buyers to verify authenticity by checking on-chain data rather than relying on trust, eliminating the need for long-term relationship building just to establish product authenticity.",

A second DevNet will be released in one week, followed by a third DevNet, and then release candidates before the mainnet release. Lithos has promised to write a forum post explaining how they're using the new features and what contracts they're building.",

      "asker": "General development update",
      "answer": "Sub-blocks are being developed to improve transaction propagation in the peer-to-peer network. A rough DevNet with peer-to-peer network based on sub-blocks should be available in a few weeks for performance testing. The goal is to achieve maximum performance possible for classic proof-of-work cryptocurrency using commodity hardware, while maintaining the classic flat peer-to-peer network setting rather than moving to data center-based solutions.",

      "answer": "Keystone is more verifiable, open, and transparent compared to Ledger. They're trying to be fully open and verifiable with a really good spirit behind the project. Ledger currently has some audit request going through a company friendly to Ledger, but the status is unclear. Keystone is considered better because of their commitment to transparency and better security practices.",

      "answer": "Storage rent has been running successfully on testnet for about a week and a half. Plans are set for this weekend to upgrade the mainnet test server, with about 28 gigahash from current mining DAO participants pointing hash power to test storage rent collection. This should generate approximately 1-2 blocks per day. Once comfortable with the results, they'll upgrade the main pool server to become the first full pool implementing storage rent on mainnet.",

      "asker": "Luke Gray Smith",
      "answer": "After 6.0, the plan is to see how it works out and potentially focus on refactoring to support sidechain constructions and launches. This would mostly involve evolutionary work without requiring many soft forks. The approach will be to do research and see how things develop, especially tracking new developments in cryptography. For peer-to-peer networking, optimal solutions seem to already be known, but cryptography will see many breakthroughs in coming years.",

      "asker": "Dan Friedman",
      "answer": "The Sigmanauts are building community first, then finding funding options - opposite to Cardano's approach of building treasury first. Their roadmap includes four revenue streams: 1) Sigmanauts Mining DAO with transaction fees, 2) SigmaLock when completed by Four Eyes, 3) taking over Sky Harbor front-end UI, and 4) M4L messaging. Each will contribute a percentage of fees to build a treasury, making them self-sufficient rather than always requesting funds from the Ergo Foundation.",

      "asker": "Follow-up discussion",
      "answer": "The Sigmanauts plan to break into subgroups for efficiency, with each sub-DAO acting autonomously while pushing funds back to the main Sigmanauts mission. Examples include the existing mining DAO, planned Sky Harbor front-end DAO, and Sigmanauts NFT DAO. This allows people who don't like the main group to join specific sub-DAOs that match their interests. The structure leverages Ergo's permissionless nature - if people disagree with majority decisions, they can form their own groups and build competing solutions.",
