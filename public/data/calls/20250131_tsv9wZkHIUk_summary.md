# Ergo PoW Blockchain - Weekly Community Call Summary

**Date:** January 31, 2025  
**Call Title:** Ergo PoW Blockchain - Weekly Update & AMA - January 30th

## Executive Summary

The Ergo community call covered significant technical progress and innovative ecosystem developments. Key highlights included progress on version 6.0 implementation with sub-blocks development and upcoming public testnet deployment, and an innovative blockchain-based recycling initiative at Cornell University using BRICK tokens to incentivize plot recycling. The team also discussed storage rent collections, upcoming community events, and partnerships between Ergo developers and the Palmyra project. A community town hall was announced for February 4th to discuss monetary innovations and storage rent mechanisms.

Technical developments showed strong momentum with v6.0 nearing completion and all identified issues being resolved. The storage rent system continues generating significant value, with a notable collection of $20,000 worth of ERG/PHP token liquidity, demonstrating the unique value of Ergo's digital waste recycling capabilities.
