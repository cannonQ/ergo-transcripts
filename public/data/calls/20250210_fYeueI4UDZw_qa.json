      "asker": "implied community question",
      "answer": "DEX conversions use liquidity pools with slippage and price impact, where prices can lag behind actual ERG price creating arbitrage opportunities. The bank conversion uses the official protocol rate based on current ERG price, but has restrictions based on reserve ratio.",
