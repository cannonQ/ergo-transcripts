[00:28] **qx()**: Hello everybody, welcome to the August 22nd AMA.
[00:33] **qx()**: We got mgPai and kushti with us today.
[00:37] **qx()**: How you guys doing?
[00:38] **kushti**: Hey guys.
[00:39] **kushti**: Hey guys, I'm doing pretty well.
[00:42] **kushti**: Doing well, doing well.
[00:43] **kushti**: Long time no see.

[00:45] **qx()**: I know, it feels like it's been weeks since the last AMA, right?
[00:49] **qx()**: We did some spaces in between.
[00:51] **kushti**: Yeah, yeah, and we'll have spaces I guess in two weeks, right?
[00:57] **kushti**: But we also need to consider a topic.
[00:59] **kushti**: So did you make a poll for the community?
[01:04] **qx()**: I forgot I was assigned to make a poll for the community.
[01:09] **kushti**: All right.
[01:10] **kushti**: So yeah, we have a couple of days probably to trust the community on the next step.
[01:19] **kushti**: Well,
[01:20] **kushti**: So yeah, there will be space in two weeks.
[01:25] **kushti**: And yes, we can have the weekly space.
[01:30] **kushti**: So we'll be even more flexible with the format.
[01:35] **kushti**: And well, I will get a couple of questions from Michael over the telegram at some point.
[01:45] **kushti**: So yeah, we'll ask them.
[01:50] **kushti**: But first update, so let's start with your participants.

[01:56] **qx()**: Look at this.
[01:57] **qx()**: I'm wearing my shirt.
[01:58] **qx()**: Are you wearing your shirt, mgPai?
[02:01] **mgPai**: No, no, no.
[02:03] **mgPai**: I still got to dig through mine, still in a pile somewhere.
[02:07] **qx()**: In their dirty clothes that you haven't washed yet since the weekend.
[02:12] **qx()**: Perfect.

[02:14] **qx()**: So Rare Evo was kind of a whirlwind weekend, right?
[02:18] **qx()**: Just flew in, worked our butts off for a good three days.
[02:22] **qx()**: Some of us did, mgPai included.
[02:24] **qx()**: And then flew right out.
[02:28] **qx()**: I think I left Saturday night.
[02:30] **qx()**: mgPai, how late did you stay?
[02:31] **qx()**: Did you end up staying until Monday, Tuesday?
[02:34] **mgPai**: Oh, no, no, I stayed.
[02:35] **mgPai**: I left on Saturday and Saturday and I have no energy.
[02:38] **mgPai**: I came from Japan that weekend, so I was so tired.
[02:41] **qx()**: Yeah.
[02:42] **qx()**: Dan put you in like one of those freight carriers.
[02:45] **qx()**: You were riding with chickens all the way from Japan.
[02:48] **mgPai**: Yeah.
[02:48] **qx()**: Just saving money for Palmyra.

[02:53] **qx()**: So yeah, I was, what's it called?
[02:56] **qx()**: We all, Dan, mgPai and I bunked together.
[02:59] **qx()**: So it's 1 a.m. and I'm trying to sleep off some 3 a.m. my time kind of thing.
[03:06] **qx()**: And I get a text from mgPai, hey, qx(), what's the address of the Airbnb and what's the code to get in?
[03:15] **mgPai**: I was so lucky he was up.
[03:17] **qx()**: I wasn't.
[03:18] **qx()**: He woke me up, mgPai.
[03:19] **qx()**: Anyway, so it was quite the event.

[03:25] **qx()**: We had what we initially thought was really prime kind of real estate, which was right across from the main stage.
[03:34] **qx()**: But in reality, from what we discovered, prime real estate is essentially just right near the big IOHK booth, just right in that central area there.
[03:44] **qx()**: So I guess for next time, we'll know what's up there.
[03:47] **qx()**: But it was good.
[03:49] **qx()**: We set up the space.
[03:50] **qx()**: We came in.
[03:51] **qx()**: Dan had some last minute tweaks to the space.
[03:56] **qx()**: So we tweaked it up a little bit, but we ended up combining all three, Palmyra, Sigmanauts, Ergo, and Rosen Bridge, into one kind of L shape.
[04:06] **qx()**: And DC Spark was kind of in the upper corner of the L there on their own all segmented away.

[04:13] **qx()**: So it was good.
[04:14] **qx()**: A lot of people came to us with name recognition for Palmyra.
[04:18] **qx()**: which was fantastic of an entry point.
[04:20] **qx()**: So we then went on to explain that this is a combined booth of Rosen.
[04:26] **qx()**: Hey, have you heard of Rosen?
[04:27] **qx()**: Okay.
[04:27] **qx()**: Well, Rosen's built on Ergo.
[04:28] **qx()**: Here's what Ergo is.
[04:30] **qx()**: So a lot of those conversations back and forth with people.
[04:33] **qx()**: You're smiling, mgPai.
[04:35] **qx()**: Why are you smiling?
[04:36] **mgPai**: No, no, it was great.
[04:39] **mgPai**: I remember some people saying that Cardano is a token on Ergo and all.

[04:45] **qx()**: It was funny.
[04:45] **qx()**: Joe tries to tell people that at those conferences.
[04:50] **qx()**: But Joe gave away a ton of Rosen shirts.
[04:53] **qx()**: I think he brought like maybe 50 or plus Rosen shirts. Maybe a hundred and those things went like hotcakes.
[04:59] **qx()**: I swear people just come to these things just to get t-shirts. We had our swag.
[05:05] **qx()**: So we got a lot of Ergo swag as well.
[05:07] **qx()**: We have Ergo sweatshirts. We have these absolutely amazing mining hats, which we'll talk about in a sec and
[05:13] **qx()**: We had t-shirts as well with that Ergo the original astronaut on there that you can see in some of the pictures on Twitter

[05:22] **qx()**: So we were selling those to try to recoup some of the money.
[05:25] **qx()**: People would just come and take them and walk away.
[05:29] **qx()**: They're like, oh, swag.
[05:30] **qx()**: And they took it right out from the big screen that said the prices.
[05:34] **qx()**: So people are used to having those things for free.
[05:37] **qx()**: I guess if you get bigger, you can rely on selling them, perhaps.
[05:40] **qx()**: So we probably need to rethink our strategy and what that means for swag in these events in the future.
[05:46] **qx()**: It might be more beneficial just to give them away.

[05:51] **qx()**: The hats specifically were the hit of the entire show. So many people the funny thing is the duality.
[06:01] **qx()**: I called it multi-chain duality of the hats because we would have people come up and be like, oh my god make mining great again I love that.
[06:12] **qx()**: I'm a miner.
[06:13] **qx()**: This is perfect.
[06:15] **qx()**: I want one so we'd sell a hat that way. We'd also have people come up and say
[06:20] **qx()**: Oh my god, I have the real make america great hat at home.
[06:23] **qx()**: This is perfect.
[06:24] **qx()**: I love it. So this hat has the ability to hit both sides of the spectrum. The sides that are pro trump pro make america great and the sides that are like, oh, this is funny. You might be picking on trump and you're using that kind of analogy there. So this hat strikes that chord right in the middle, which is perfect.

[06:43] **qx()**: Mark and I, Mark the Shark was also there.
[06:47] **qx()**: We were wearing the hats outside of the Casino and we went to a restaurant and we promptly put them in our bags. He didn't want to cause some commotion out there because I imagine a lot of people at the Mexican Cantina have no idea what Ergo proof of work mining is so we figured we'd play it safe, better safe than sorry in that instance, but it was great

[07:12] **qx()**: I think we had a lot of interactions with the people there. What I found and maybe mgPai you can tell me your thoughts on what you saw. I'd say we had about 50% of the people across our booth were other exhibitors and 50% of the people were guests. So I don't think there was I'd like to see the numbers of Rare Evo, but I don't know.

[07:39] **qx()**: All I'm saying is there's a lot of room for telling people about Ergo that didn't know it before, that were there for Cardano, or there were some Solana people there as well as guests, but then also about projects saying, hey, here's what you can use Ergo for, here's what Palmyra does.
[07:58] **qx()**: Have you heard of Rosen Bridge?
[07:59] **qx()**: You have a token on Cardano, we can bridge it here, you can bridge it from there.
[08:03] **qx()**: kind of thing.
[08:04] **qx()**: So a lot of those were the exhibitors going on there, which was interesting, I thought.

[08:09] **qx()**: And by the end of the conference, I was convinced, maybe it was because I was tired, maybe not.
[08:15] **qx()**: But I was convinced that these conferences are more along the lines of, I don't want to say circle jerk, but other people have described it as circle jerk.
[08:22] **qx()**: But I want to describe it as a proof of life, I'd say.
[08:28] **qx()**: So if you're a project in the crypto space and you show up to this thing and you have a booth and you're talking to other people and mingling with them, that's proof that you're alive and you're doing it.
[08:39] **qx()**: I guess if we look at it under that lens at this point in time when the way things are maybe that's...

Yeah, Jamai confirmed definitely circle jerk and Jamai is one that got we had one VIP pass with our thing and Jamai got the VIP pass and went to the Elijah Wood Disco party thing.
[08:59] **qx()**: I think he only stayed for an hour though.
[09:01] **qx()**: It's very loud.
[09:02] **qx()**: mgPai What are your thoughts on how Rare Evo went?

[09:05] **mgPai**: Yeah, I think it was a great event, much better than last year's Rare Evo, much more exhibitors around.
[09:13] **mgPai**: Yeah, like qx() said, there's a lot of exhibitors, so I don't even know if half the people were just exhibitors or just normal people, genuinely curious.
[09:23] **mgPai**: So I'm sure there's a lot of exhibitors and their friends and their family, more so than the average public.
[09:30] **mgPai**: I think maybe for next year, we should try to advertise the general public more, at least even more so like at least the general crypto public right outside of the Cardano ecosystem, that itself would be a great start.
[09:44] **mgPai**: But definitely better event.
[09:46] **mgPai**: And I think the quality of projects were better too than last year, since it's probably more filtered out from the market conditions and all.
[09:55] **mgPai**: So I enjoyed a lot of projects, a lot of gaming projects.
[09:59] **mgPai**: However, the games this time around seem to be much more legitimate.
[10:04] **mgPai**: Like they seem much more graphically better and smoother.
[10:09] **mgPai**: So I enjoyed that.

[10:11] **mgPai**: But I got to say my favorite part of the event was the demonstration of Cardano's Layer 2 Hydra, because
[10:20] **mgPai**: They coded a game, an entire game called Doom on-chain.
[10:25] **mgPai**: It's a first-person shooter game, and it was entirely running on Hydra.
[10:30] **mgPai**: So every movement that you made, every shoot, everything, anything you did in the game was an on-chain transaction.
[10:37] **mgPai**: And if you're familiar with the game,
[10:40] **mgPai**: One of the lowest rates a game can run is 32 frames per second, right?
[10:46] **mgPai**: 32 updates a second.
[10:47] **mgPai**: And this is exactly what the game did on Hydra.
[10:51] **mgPai**: 32 transactions a second.
[10:53] **mgPai**: And that was a pretty cool demonstration.
[10:56] **mgPai**: Makes me super excited to see the future on Cardano.

[11:00] **mgPai**: them building on Hydra and also I don't think UTXO is going anywhere anytime soon especially because of this Hydra thing that Cardano is releasing so I'm just looking forward to the updates and I'm sure we can in the future apply this on Ergo as well because of the similarities of UTXO that both chains share.

[11:23] **qx()**: Yeah, it was pretty cool.
[11:23] **qx()**: 30 frames a second.
[11:24] **qx()**: I think they were running three Hydra heads to be able to do it at the time.
[11:29] **qx()**: But definitely interesting.
[11:30] **qx()**: We know you're very interested in speed.
[11:32] **qx()**: I think it's a young and ambitious mgPai.
[11:37] **qx()**: But that was pretty neat.
[11:37] **qx()**: I think that got a lot of attention there and they seem to be pushing that on socials as well.

[11:42] **qx()**: Another cool thing about the conference was that there were actually people that showed up, business people, that showed up.
[11:49] **qx()**: There were at least three that I spoke to directly before passing them off to Dan, and they came specifically because they're looking for things like Palmyra to get their goods out of a country.
[12:01] **qx()**: One guy was
[12:02] **qx()**: What was that guy?
[12:04] **qx()**: Goodness.
[12:05] **qx()**: I can't remember what the heck he was trying to export but we saw some opals that are being mined from an opal mine in Was it Washington State or Oregon or something like that?
[12:17] **qx()**: So that was pretty neat.

[12:18] **qx()**: Oh kushti shut off his video even though we told him not
[12:22] **kushti**: Yeah, sorry, so yeah Realized there is some spam in the no worries.
[12:28] **qx()**: No worries.
[12:28] **qx()**: We'll keep going.
[12:29] **kushti**: Yeah Already cleared.
[12:31] **kushti**: Yeah Let me check questions from michael here in two seconds.
[12:36] **kushti**: So yeah, well, I need to rotate my pets to read the chats then yeah, it's better to switch video off than to have it chaotically
[12:49] **kushti**: shaking.

[12:53] **qx()**: You look there, kushti, while I finish.
[12:57] **qx()**: So that was very interesting to see, for sure.
[12:59] **qx()**: Have people actually coming for that kind of thing.
[13:01] **qx()**: So in the future, I hope that we also have people coming for things like Rosen, or coming for the tooling that they hear about on Ergo.
[13:09] **qx()**: I mean, that's a hope, but we'll see.
[13:12] **qx()**: We'll see what happens from there.

[13:14] **qx()**: But overall, I think we had
[13:19] **qx()**: I don't know if I was exhilarated by the conference.
[13:23] **qx()**: Definitely next year, we should set some expectations, like this is what we expect.
[13:29] **qx()**: Here's some swag we're going to donate and give away instead of sell, those kind of things.
[13:33] **qx()**: So each of these is quite the learning experience for that.
[13:37] **qx()**: But overall, it did get our name out.
[13:40] **qx()**: It was proof of life there.
[13:41] **qx()**: And we have a ton of swag.

[13:43] **qx()**: We have about $4,000 left of swag, maybe $4,500 worth of swag left.
[13:47] **qx()**: And we are going to move forward kind of on a beta version of auction house swag selling.
[13:53] **qx()**: This is going to be without Anne Unreal's help.
[13:55] **qx()**: He's busy with some other stuff right now.
[13:58] **qx()**: So for now, we're going to mint NFTs one-to-one for the swag.
[14:02] **qx()**: We're going to post them on auction house.
[14:04] **qx()**: We're also going to mint NFTs for general shipping to different countries.
[14:07] **qx()**: Post those on auction house.
[14:09] **qx()**: You buy the NFT you want from the swag.
[14:11] **qx()**: You buy the shipping you want from the swag.
[14:12] **qx()**: And then you're just going to go to a little portal on the Sigmanauts site.
[14:15] **qx()**: Enter a relay address or an address to ship it to in our database will just not burn but will mark those NFTs specifically as being used and not able to be shipped to again and will ship you out the product from sunny Colorado where Mark the Shark is holding all the swag including these amazing mining hats they say

[14:44] **qx()**: There we go.
[14:44] **qx()**: Wear mine backwards, you wear his forward mgPai.
[14:47] **qx()**: So we'll post all those on Auction House at some point and start announcing them and put them in our social so people can click there and you'll have an NFT representation of your actual product and it'll also be used to ship you the product.
[15:01] **qx()**: So that's what we're looking for.
[15:02] **qx()**: kushti, what's new with you?
[15:04] **qx()**: What's new with Michael?
[15:06] **qx()**: Michael's got some questions for you.

[15:08] **kushti**: Yeah, but all the three questions are for mgPai.
[15:14] **kushti**: We'll ask them.
[15:15] **kushti**: We're giving the questions around.
[15:17] **qx()**: So what's new?
[15:19] **qx()**: You got node 6.0?

[15:21] **kushti**: Yeah, so actually, I had a lot of talks with Bruno about Gluon, post Gluon basically.
[15:30] **kushti**: Yeah, some other stablecoin constructions.
[15:35] **kushti**: Well, he has in mind.
[15:38] **kushti**: Then, yes, some variants of HODLcoin and some prediction market-like scheme based on variants of HODLcoin and so on.
[15:57] **kushti**: So, yeah, a lot of discussions and, well, hopefully,
[16:05] **kushti**: Well, an implementation of some new thing will be started soon.

[16:12] **kushti**: Then, yeah, well, Gluon is launched, right?
[16:15] **kushti**: And, well, still it's in the soft launching stage, so there was no broad announcement from Bruno in Stability Nexus and so on, as far as I know yet.
[16:31] **kushti**: But, yeah, it will be done in the coming days.

[16:35] **kushti**: Then, yeah, so for Dexy, well, we are still doing reviewing one by one, one contract after another, and deploying.
[16:47] **kushti**: So, well, recently LP Redeem was deployed, and now, well, me and not me only, so for us and so on.
[17:05] **kushti**: bank contracts right to well deploy them after so yeah well soft launch will be yeah in weeks so i think yeah there is a lot actually to learn from soft launch

[17:37] **kushti**: then yeah a lot of development towards Sigma 6.0 so now there is initial pull requests for 6.0 for testnet, right, and currently I'm working on launching my own developer network, kind of.
[17:55] **kushti**: test network on my machine with 6.0 activated and see how it goes.
[18:02] **kushti**: So the testing transaction maybe even this time there will be well testing kit with transactions using new features, new
[18:18] **kushti**: data type and so on.

[18:21] **kushti**: So also still polishing a lot of features in Sigma in Perl.
[18:30] **kushti**: And yeah, so for sub-blocks, mostly working still on refactoring and loading.
[18:41] **kushti**: Well, generation of Merkle proof for multiple leaves to then proceed with
[18:48] **kushti**: networking messages and implement a sub-block exchange on P2P layer.
[18:59] **kushti**: Yeah, so a lot of things.

[19:09] **qx()**: kushti, what's 6.0 deployment look like?
[19:13] **qx()**: What's that process look like for deployment?

[19:16] **kushti**: Yeah, it's usually for all the soft forks, including this one.
[19:25] **kushti**: It's about miners working right.
[19:28] **kushti**: So parameters are different on my own devnet and the mainnet, but still it's about miner signaling and automatic activation.
[19:43] **kushti**: It's about activation of sub-validation rules.
[19:49] **kushti**: I used to check, well, a couple of validation rules will be deactivated, but yeah, they are touching on the serialization, right, in regards to it.
[20:07] **kushti**: They're doing some checks, obsolete, right, where there is a new functionality now.
[20:19] **kushti**: And yeah, so something like that.
[20:23] **kushti**: And with that, old versions also would be in sync, right?
[20:30] **kushti**: So they will deactivate the same rules and yeah, we'll skip validation of scripts not being recognized.
[20:44] **kushti**: But yeah, so, well, they still will be in sync.
[20:49] **kushti**: So it will be like a 5.0 soft fork.

[20:55] **qx()**: So this will be the first vote that the Sigmanauts mining DAO will have to do on Paideia to see if we implement it or not.
[21:05] **kushti**: Right.
[21:07] **kushti**: And, yeah.
[21:08] **kushti**: So, before, GetBlok made some voting rights.
[21:13] **qx()**: Right.
[21:13] **kushti**: Right.
[21:13] **qx()**: They sent out tokens.
[21:14] **qx()**: You had to vote in a wallet.
[21:15] **qx()**: Yep.
[21:16] **qx()**: GetBlok did.
[21:17] **kushti**: Yeah.
[21:17] **kushti**: I forgotten for EIP 27 probably.
[21:22] **qx()**: It's about two years ago, whatever that was.
[21:24] **qx()**: Yeah.
[21:25] **kushti**: Yeah.
[21:26] **kushti**: So yeah, it was 27.
[21:27] **kushti**: I believe, the softest fork.
[21:31] **kushti**: only miners had to update actually and only miners validating actually in EIP 27.
[21:42] **kushti**: So other nodes, so yeah well don't need to do anything.

[21:50] **kushti**: All right so yeah also doing a lot of talks these days seems a lot of
[22:00] **kushti**: Maybe not a lot, but some new faces in development channels, right?
[22:08] **kushti**: Yeah, questions how to fork the Ergo code base and so on.
[22:14] **kushti**: So some more projects.
[22:18] **kushti**: I'm discussing, like, Jamai and so on.

[22:23] **kushti**: And yeah, so for ChainCash, I'm excited that, well, finally, I realized that API is done somehow at some point, so suddenly by Dusek.
[22:37] **kushti**: Kamal and yeah so I realized that yeah it's working and yeah I made the first mainnet ChainCash transactions actually for me minting reserve for minting first notes and then sending it to Kamal

[23:00] **kushti**: And then, yeah, so we found an issue in contracts preventing from spending the same notes twice for
[23:15] **kushti**: the same public key.
[23:18] **kushti**: So yeah, then our contracts got updated and yeah, the server got updated as well.
[23:24] **kushti**: So we are ready now for another round of testing.
[23:29] **kushti**: Now, well, we can include some more people there, like Jamai and so on.
[23:35] **kushti**: So yeah, if anyone is interested, please visit the telegram groups.
[23:44] **kushti**: And yeah, let's play around.

[23:49] **qx()**: How's the developer DAO going, kushti?

[23:54] **kushti**: Well, I think there is a need for another rework here because it's going quite slow.
[24:02] **kushti**: So yeah, well, let's see.
[24:07] **kushti**: So I think there is probably to reshape it.
[24:18] **kushti**: right and yeah so what we are discussing in yeah sorry yeah i've clicked somewhere oh okay yeah so what we've what we are discussing developers DAO is well doing tutorials right and supporting some integrations like hardware wallets

[24:44] **kushti**: And then, yeah, also supporting libraries where it's needed.
[24:48] **kushti**: So, yeah, if you need for some new feature in the library, whatever, please let us know.
[24:57] **kushti**: Then, yeah, probably, as asked for many times, there is need to update the Oracle Pool software, right, to support more use case, like people asked.
[25:11] **kushti**: for billing and so on.
[25:14] **kushti**: But yeah, well, we need to formalize requirements, I guess.
[25:20] **kushti**: And then, yeah, it will be possible to update the Oracle Pool software and the contracts probably also accordingly.
[25:34] **kushti**: All right, that's probably it.

[25:37] **qx()**: Yeah, it's tough to, I think I spoke with
[25:42] **qx()**: Who was it?
[25:43] **qx()**: I interviewed with Mark the Shark and TimErg on their show while I was in Vegas, and one of the things I said was, it's tough when you're trying to, like kushti, you're trying to kickstart the developer DAO.
[25:57] **qx()**: Unless you find somebody specifically to spearhead that with you or for you alongside you it's really tough to get something started when you only have like 5% of your time to dedicate to it so I was saying the same thing about the good DAO and that I'd love to in the near future perhaps step away from the Sigmanauts for a couple months just to focus on the good DAO and get that bolstered up and spearheaded and

[26:24] **qx()**: and get some people in there and more funds in there and then when that's good return to more things at the Sigmanauts so it may come to that actually because I don't want to see it's been slow burning for too long and I really want it to pick up so that's really it's really tough to start something when you have like one to five percent time stream to do it so

[26:47] **kushti**: Yeah, well, I think there is a need to experiment with different formats to find the efficient ones because, well, it's not probably the ordinary setting.
[27:02] **kushti**: So we have people from all the different time zones, all the possible different cultures.
[27:18] **kushti**: yeah then well level of dedication right is waiting from time to time and so on so yeah well there is need to find an efficient structure for that and yeah well i think that's doable after all

[27:42] **kushti**: And so, yeah, well, also we are having a lot of chats in the main group, right, and so on, periodically now, well, on what makes Ergo.
[27:54] **kushti**: And, well, I think a lot of materials will appear, hopefully, from that.
[28:08] **kushti**: Let's see.
[28:11] **kushti**: But I think in general, the Ergo position is quite unique at the moment.
[28:17] **kushti**: It's fully open sourced and the most permissionless, license-wise financial stack probably.

[28:33] **qx()**: I agree.
[28:34] **qx()**: I agree.
[28:35] **qx()**: And it makes me, sometimes these shows, definitely last year at the CNFTCon and not as much this year at Rare Evo, but sometimes I leave a little depressed about the whole ecosystem and space as a whole.
[28:49] **qx()**: from these conferences just because we're around we kind of live in a bubble around Ergo where everything's shared where we all push towards things that potentially will better society and give more freedom to everybody's personal financial state there and then we go to these conferences and we're like oh

[29:07] **qx()**: If you fluff me, I'll give you an NFT kind of thing.
[29:11] **qx()**: And it's quite the different experience when you go to these things.
[29:16] **qx()**: So it's nice to return.
[29:18] **qx()**: It's nice to go to get a reminder of what we do here and why we do it, which is great.

[29:23] **qx()**: I think we got a question for mgPai right here, right off the bat.
[29:27] **kushti**: Oh, sorry.
[29:27] **kushti**: We have four questions for mgPai, right?
[29:30] **qx()**: We got a question for mgPai.
[29:31] **kushti**: Yep, yep.
[29:32] **kushti**: So three from Mike and yeah.
[29:35] **qx()**: Let's do the, let's do, let's do Vydom first.
[29:38] **qx()**: He says, hi guys, mgPai, how is Keystone integration doing?
[29:42] **qx()**: Will you need some help from us as a community?
[29:44] **qx()**: Will integration be as long as Ledger?

[29:48] **mgPai**: Yeah, sure.
[29:49] **mgPai**: So no, integration won't be as long as Ledger.
[29:53] **mgPai**: It's much simpler or at least much more frictionless because you got to talk to a lot of people for Ledger or at least get official approval, which takes a lot of time.
[30:04] **mgPai**: So Keystone will be much faster.
[30:06] **mgPai**: I was just busy in the last few weeks traveling and all, but yeah, I started back on the Keystone integration and it's going pretty well.
[30:15] **mgPai**: And yeah, we're probably going to reach out.
[30:18] **mgPai**: For help from the Ergo DAO.
[30:21] **mgPai**: I just got to structure and know what exactly the responsibilities of whoever will help what that will be but I'm working with myself and Nemo on getting this together

[30:34] **qx()**: Awesome, and don't forget you have to go to school mgPai and succeed there, too. Let's not let that slip. kushti, do you have the questions on your end for mgPai from Mike?

[30:49] **kushti**: Yeah.
[30:49] **kushti**: So, one is a duplicate for that.
[30:56] **kushti**: And, yeah.
[30:56] **kushti**: So, another question is, when Ergo Names, Michael's question.

[31:03] **mgPai**: Yeah, sure.
[31:04] **qx()**: So I yelled that to you as well.
[31:08] **mgPai**: A lot of people are screaming at me on this names.
[31:14] **mgPai**: So yeah, it's getting, it's not complete yet, unfortunately, as I wanted, but there were some issues in the contract, or at least issues of actually implementing some things.
[31:27] **mgPai**: So just doing the smaller refactor of the contracts to get it working.
[31:32] **mgPai**: And then my friend Luca, LGD is working on that.
[31:39] **mgPai**: And once that's done, we're going to again begin the off-chain implementation.
[31:44] **mgPai**: So it's like nearly there maybe like 70% there. But luckily once all this is out like not many like upgrades or anything will be needed in future because it's quite robust, be thought of a lot of things with the payment structure so you can like pay with any token you want and then we have some names recursive sub names from the start So it's gonna be a really cool thing once launched

[32:15] **qx()**: Nice and we saw what's Cardano's called on the side is handle, right?
[32:19] **mgPai**: Yes, you see the handles.
[32:20] **mgPai**: Yeah.
[32:21] **qx()**: Well, they put they put a money sign in front of the word handle.
[32:24] **qx()**: So every time I look at it, I want to say shit handle.
[32:29] **qx()**: It's very confusing visually, but yeah, we saw Quokka there over there at handle.
[32:36] **qx()**: He works for handle as well.

[32:38] **qx()**: And that brings us to our next question.
[32:40] **qx()**: So I think Kilber asked, do we have any update on SkyHarbor's team progress?
[32:47] **qx()**: Last I heard, yes.
[32:48] **qx()**: they're, there was some progress done.
[32:52] **qx()**: I think he mentioned it this week last weekend.
[32:55] **qx()**: But he's fully aware as well that I'm going to make a Sigmanauts proposal to fork that and try to get funds for a dev that will agree to being paid from the revenue stream from the front end of that.
[33:08] **qx()**: So so we're all on board.
[33:10] **qx()**: We're pushing for it and we hope to keep it sustained, not just we don't want it to just be a fix.
[33:16] **qx()**: And then in one year we're going to run into the same problem where it's not updated and that kind of thing.
[33:20] **qx()**: The idea is
[33:21] **qx()**: Quokka's team is going to fix it, release it, and then hopefully Sigmanauts vote to fork it and find a dev that will work from the revenue stream there as well as the Sigmanauts management and keep it going forward there.
[33:35] **qx()**: So, excited about that.
[33:37] **qx()**: kushti, do you got another question for mgPai?

[33:40] **kushti**: Another question from Michael, the last one, is how is Palmyra development going for Ergo?

[33:54] **mgPai**: Yeah, sure.
[33:55] **mgPai**: So right now, it's going quite well.
[33:58] **mgPai**: We're moving forward, Palmyra's been in talks with a lot of different teams and all for potential people onboarding to our marketplace and also that front's going quite nice.
[34:12] **mgPai**: Again, I can't really talk much about this.
[34:16] **mgPai**: Then,
[34:17] **mgPai**: Yeah, again, coding wise, we've been focused on Ergo integration onto our Palmyra Pro application.
[34:26] **mgPai**: Palmyra Pro is something that businesses will use directly to add metadata to their
[34:33] **mgPai**: commodity itself right so that's the entry point into a traceability and the phone application itself is what's going to be directly connected to Ergo chain and we're going to be putting traceability from like the metadata the business's input on their commodity and that's directly going to be stored on Ergo all right

[35:02] **kushti**: And, yeah, so, talking also with Sam these days periodically.
[35:10] **kushti**: And yeah, it seems he's interested in all the kushti stuff, right?
[35:15] **kushti**: Like Gluon and yeah, Dexy, ChainCash.
[35:22] **qx()**: Talking with who?
[35:23] **qx()**: Who did you say you're talking to?
[35:25] **kushti**: Sam, so... Oh, Sam from Palmyra.
[35:29] **kushti**: Yeah.
[35:31] **qx()**: Very cool.

[35:32] **qx()**: All right.
[35:35] **qx()**: We've got another question here.
[35:37] **qx()**: This is for maybe everybody from, wow.
[35:43] **qx()**: Neuro.
[35:45] **qx()**: What would be the, I butchered that.
[35:46] **qx()**: What would be the downsides of extending the duration of ErgoHack?
[35:49] **qx()**: Wouldn't it potentially increase the amount of people that considered joining?

[35:52] **mgPai**: Oh, yeah.
[35:57] **mgPai**: I think it should be increased.
[35:59] UNKNOWN: Yeah.
[35:59] **kushti**: I think that already was done, right?
[36:04] **kushti**: So they had a long ErgoHack once, I believe.
[36:09] **kushti**: So they were very different.
[36:11] **qx()**: What happened between them?
[36:14] **qx()**: Was it successful?
[36:15] **kushti**: I've forgotten actually.
[36:19] **kushti**: Probably it was pretty much the same.
[36:21] **kushti**: So yeah, I don't know.
[36:24] **kushti**: So the problem with long ErgoHacks, people are getting distracted with real-life matters, right?
[36:33] **kushti**: So probably doing pretty much the same as in three days.
[36:36] **kushti**: Because, yeah, well, everyone usually, well, especially developers.
[36:46] **kushti**: So everyone is busy, right?

[36:49] **mgPai**: Why not like a month-long ErgoHack?
[36:51] **mgPai**: That would be fun.
[36:53] **qx()**: Yeah, but see my wife mgPai.
[36:56] **qx()**: Yeah, I spent four days not seeing my wife at all Weekends no Yeah, so so so pretty much the same.
[37:06] **kushti**: So it could be one month or one year, but Well people do have families jobs, right all that stuff.
[37:13] **kushti**: So yeah, then they would pretty much spent just one or two weekends writing

[37:24] **kushti**: No more anyway, so.
[37:28] **kushti**: Yeah, then I think there is not much difference for most of people, right?
[37:36] **kushti**: Between three days and one month.
[37:40] **kushti**: Anyway, three days would be dedicated only at most.

[37:51] **qx()**: Oh, I forgot to mention, too, on a side note about Rare Evo.
[37:55] **qx()**: We had a full rig set up.
[37:57] **qx()**: I brought my Razer laptop that I used to use as a mining testnet, mining core.
[38:04] **qx()**: And I threw up Cyberverse on it.
[38:08] **qx()**: And Mr. Pixel made us a character, gave it some tools, and renamed it Rare Evo, and we left it there.
[38:15] **qx()**: And while that booth didn't really facilitate a fun, or not a fun, but easy to play environment, it's table level, we probably should have had a booth up high, so like the other gaming booths where they could do it.
[38:29] **qx()**: Everybody that saw absolutely loved it.
[38:32] **qx()**: They love the play to earn kind of feature of it.
[38:35] **qx()**: They love the fact that you own all your NFTs with that 100% positive from it.
[38:42] **qx()**: I hope that Mr. Pixel sees some increased or maybe some more foot traffic in there from that, but we'll see.
[38:50] **qx()**: We'll see what he says.
[38:52] **qx()**: Super cool.
[38:52] **qx()**: I mean it was very unique.
[38:54] **qx()**: There was only there was one other game there on the other side I think made by the DC Spark guys that was kind of similar pixel based But nothing that's kind of quite the look as Cyberverse. Cyberverse has that neon kind of before I was born or the century I was born in decade I was born and kind of look that gives you that nostalgicness whereas the other games are more or less

[39:20] **qx()**: They look like Farmville that kind of thing.
[39:23] **qx()**: Cyberverse is very unique.
[39:25] **qx()**: So lots of positive responses from that and having that there.
[39:29] **qx()**: So that's something I could do every time as well.
[39:32] **qx()**: More of those kind of demos.
[39:33] **qx()**: Maybe we can set them up better next time.
[39:34] **qx()**: Bring headphones, bring a dedicated like pillar where the stuff can be set up and go from there.
[39:40] **qx()**: But lots of stuff to learn from them.

[39:42] **qx()**: All right, we got another question.
[39:44] **qx()**: kushti, what are the options you're discussing for the initial use for ChainCash?
[39:50] **qx()**: That's from Wombo22.

[39:51] **kushti**: Yeah, so actually, well, what I'm discussing with Piers and thinking about
[40:02] **kushti**: is the following options.
[40:06] **kushti**: The first one is to use it for communities, mostly trust-based currents like local exchange trading systems.
[40:18] **kushti**: Then it's about one UI.
