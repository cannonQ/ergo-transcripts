# Ergo Community Call Summary - September 6, 2024

## Executive Summary

This weekly Ergo community call featured updates from key developers and community leaders, with significant discussion around real-world asset tokenization, upcoming technical developments, and community governance initiatives. Dan Friedman shared progress on Palmyra's tokenization projects, including work with Argentine lithium producers and Greek olive oil authentication, while kushti provided development updates on Ergo 6.0 and sub-blocks implementation. The call emphasized Ergo's positioning as an advanced blockchain technology that's ahead of its time, with various autonomous community organizations working toward self-sustainability.

The discussion highlighted the contrast between Ergo's grassroots community-first approach versus other ecosystems that build funding mechanisms first. Key technical milestones include the first DevNet release for Ergo 6.0, progress on storage rent implementation in mining pools, and upcoming wallet integrations with hardware providers like Keystone.

## Notable Quotes

**kushti**: "The goal is to achieve the maximum performance which is achievable by classic proof-of-work cryptocurrency with commodity hardware... not like what some data center-based, well, quasi-blockchains are doing now."

**qx()**: "The benefit is the people that are here want to be here, not because there's a lot of money in the treasury... but because they have a vision and a shared vision of the purpose and intent of what Ergo is."

**Dan Friedman**: "I think Ergo is just this powerhouse way ahead of its time with all these different functions and all these different goodies built in. But people are still stuck on the plug into the wall, little red numbers and a couple of functions calculators."
