# Ergo Community Call Summary - January 3, 2025

## Executive Summary

This New Year community call focused on Ergo's 2025 development roadmap and community initiatives. Kushti provided updates on sub-blocks development, explaining the current challenges around transaction packing, state updating, and rules for different transaction types. He emphasized that while most transactions (99%) could be confirmed immediately in sub-blocks, some transactions dependent on block headers would only be allowed in full blocks every two minutes. The technical work is progressing with prototype code expected soon.

The call also highlighted Ergo's strategic vision for 2025, centered around "peer-to-peer digital free banking" with emphasis on uncensorable on-ramps, cross-chain functionality, and expanded stablecoin offerings. Community projects like Sigmanauts mining DAO's token recycling initiative and Cyberverse's upcoming Ronin network expansion were discussed, alongside infrastructure improvements including multi-sig wallet development and Keystone hardware wallet integration.

**QX on Self-Custody Philosophy**: "I think humanity at least has gone through a period of uneducation, right? The removal of self-custody and the removal of the importance of that. They've traded comfort or power over themselves and their own entities."
