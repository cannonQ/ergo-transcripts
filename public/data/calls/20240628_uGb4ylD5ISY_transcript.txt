as far as i know -> as far as I know
so well -> so well
the node -> the node
has some apy -> has some API
but yeah -> but yeah
it's -> it's
it's not even tested -> it's not even tested
so it would be good -> so it would be good
if -> if
someone can test it -> someone can test it
this API -> this API
is showing -> is showing
how much -> how much
you need to pay -> you need to pay
to get into -> to get into
the next block -> the next block

something like that -> something like that
Like Bitcoin wallets -> like Bitcoin wallets
are doing well -> are doing
after years -> after years
of different events -> of different events
and so on -> and so on
yeah -> yeah
in this regards -> in this regard
probably -> probably
applications -> applications
are not that hardened -> are not that hardened
but still -> but still
you can set -> you can set
custom fee -> custom fee
like everywhere -> like everywhere
right -> right
Yeah -> yeah
I can see -> I can see
that being useful -> that being useful

Yeah -> yeah
All right -> all right
Yeah -> yeah
Yeah -> yeah
Yeah -> yeah
Yeah -> yeah
Yeah -> yeah

in a very hashy type of way -> in a very hashy type of way
Yeah -> yeah
Yeah -> yeah
So just -> so just
a lot of stuff -> a lot of stuff
I've been getting -> I haven't been getting
much sleep -> much sleep

please update -> please update
to the latest -> to the latest
Rosenbridge -> Rosen Bridge
there -> there
There was -> there was
a 3.1 -> a 3.1
like -> like
a 3.01 -> a 3.01
maybe or something -> maybe or something
was a version -> was a version
and there was -> and there was
a bug -> a bug
in the release -> in the release
so they had -> so they had
people hold off -> people hold off
but then -> but then
they released -> they released
3.1.1 -> 3.1.1
for the Watcher UI -> for the Watcher UI
for the Watcher -> for the Watcher
and then -> and then
the 2.2.1 -> the 2.2.1
for the Watcher UI -> for the Watcher UI
so just do -> so just do
that docker compose pull -> that: docker compose pull
docker compose down -> docker compose down
docker compose up hyphen d -> docker compose up -d
and that's all -> and that's all
you have to do -> you have to do
and then -> and then
just go -> just go
to your web version -> to your web version
and make sure -> and make sure
that you have -> that you have
the those versions -> those versions
that i just mentioned -> that I just mentioned
and you're good to go -> and you're good to go
there's still -> there's still
we -> we
attempted -> attempted
a manual tx -> a manual TX
yesterday -> yesterday
to the guards -> to GARD's
did -> DAO
to -> to
refund people -> refund people
with the slashed permit -> with the slashed permit
from that accidental -> from that accidental
high fee transaction -> high fee transaction
that tried -> that tried
to go through -> to go through
the bridge -> the bridge
That didn't go through -> that didn't go through
for some reason -> for some reason
I think -> I think
maybe -> maybe
somebody missed -> somebody missed
a signature -> a signature
but they're looking -> but they're looking
into -> into
why that is -> why that is
and then -> and then
we'll try -> we'll try
to push it again -> to push it again
So you guys -> so you guys
should have -> should have
your permits back -> your permits back
soon -> soon
because -> because
we are actively -> we are actively
working on it -> working on it
to get that back -> to get that back
But yeah -> but yeah
great -> great
Should we take -> should we take
some questions -> some questions
Sure -> sure
let's do it -> let's do it
Let's do it -> let's do it
So let's start -> so let's start
from the top here -> from the top here
Question for Alex -> question for Alex
Can you explain -> can you explain
what bulletproofs are -> what bulletproofs are
So -> so
bulletproofs -> bulletproofs
well -> well
it's a kind -> it's a kind
of technique -> of technique
for zero knowledge -> for zero-knowledge
which is allowing -> which is allowing
for some specific -> for some specific
zero-knowledge statements -> zero-knowledge statements
specific statements -> specific statements
to be proven -> to be proven
in zero knowledge -> in zero-knowledge
for example -> for example
Monero -> Monero
is using -> is using
bulletproof -> bulletproofs
for range proof -> for range proofs
But yeah -> but yeah
well -> well
it's also possible -> it's also possible
to prove -> to prove
for generic statements -> generic statements
So basically -> so basically
to use them -> to use them
as an alternative -> as an alternative
to snarks -> to SNARKs
and actually -> and actually
trustless alternatives -> trustless alternatives
to snarks -> to SNARKs
because -> because
There is no -> there is no
trusted setup here -> trusted setup here
in Bulletproof -> in bulletproofs
so it's basically -> so it's basically
a specific form -> a specific form
of a Sigma protocol -> of a Sigma protocol
Well -> well
maybe not -> maybe not
a very correct statement -> a very correct statement
but yeah -> but yeah
okay -> okay
it's good -> it's good
for startups -> for start-ups
And then -> and then
yeah -> yeah
so -> so
well -> well
the point is -> the point is
that what I'm -> that what I'm
trying to do -> trying to do
is to have -> is to have
bulletproof -> bulletproof
verification -> verification
done in ErgoScript -> done in ErgoScript
And if that's possible -> and if that's possible
then yeah -> then yeah
it means -> it means
that similar kinds -> that similar kinds
of proofs -> of proofs
like recently -> like recently
appeared -> appeared
compact sigma protocols -> compact Sigma protocols
or well -> or well
old growth one out of many -> old Groth one-out-of-many
Proof -> proof
also could be used -> also could be used
Grosso -> Groth
was used -> was used
in an initial version -> in an initial version
of Zcoin -> of Zcoin
for example -> for example
And well -> and well
there are already -> there are already
some attempts -> some attempts
to use -> to use
compact sigma protocols -> compact Sigma protocols
in some projects -> in some projects
for verifiable credentials -> for verifiable credentials
all that stuff -> all that stuff
So -> so
yeah -> yeah
well -> well
in particular -> in particular
if that's possible -> if that's possible
that means -> that means
that's a variety -> that's a variety
of zero-knowledge -> of zero-knowledge
protocols -> protocols
could be used -> could be used
well -> well
along with -> along with
Ergo contracts -> Ergo contracts
right -> right
And that means -> and that means
that -> that
well -> well
in particular -> in particular
you can have -> you can have
hybrid contracts -> hybrid contracts
right -> right
So you can have -> so you can have
something -> something
verified on chain -> verified on-chain
well -> well
and with execution -> and with execution
right -> right
with revealing -> with revealing
all the needed data -> all the needed data
for contracts -> for contracts
but also -> but also
well -> well
for some sensitive data -> for some sensitive data
you can just -> you can just
verify proof -> verify proof
in a contract -> in a contract
and avoid -> and avoid
data disclosure -> data disclosure
So that means -> so that means
the whole new world -> the whole new world
of possibilities here -> of possibilities here
in regards with -> in regards with
combining contracts -> combining contracts
and zero-knowledge statements -> and zero-knowledge statements
Anything to add -> anything to add
to that QX -> to that, qx()?
No -> no
I was going -> I was going
to ask a question -> to ask a question
I didn't want -> I didn't want
to take up -> to take up
too much time -> too much time
though -> though
I was just -> I was just
going to see how -> going to see how
Yeah -> yeah
I can ask it later -> I can ask it later
No worries -> no worries
Keep going -> keep going
Dan -> Dan
Let's bang out -> let's bang out
some more questions -> some more questions
All right -> all right
so another question -> so another question
from Wombo22 -> from Wombo22
for Dan -> for Dan
Can you explain -> can you explain
the significance -> the significance
of the ZenGate -> of the Palmyra
and Chainlink partnership -> and Chainlink partnership
Right -> right
so what we're -> so what we're
going to be doing -> going to be doing
with Chainlink -> with Chainlink
is we're going -> is we're going
to be utilizing -> to be utilizing
a proof of reserve -> a proof of reserve
and their functions -> and their functions
through a proxy function -> through a proxy function
in Winter Protocol -> in Winter Protocol
to be able -> to be able
to provide -> to provide
on-chain warehouse receipts -> on-chain warehouse receipts
which are used for -> which are used for
well -> well
traditional warehouse receipts -> traditional warehouse receipts
are used for -> are used for
traditional trade financing -> traditional trade financing
so on-chain -> so on-chain
warehouse receipts -> warehouse receipts
are going to be used -> are going to be used
for decentralized -> for decentralized
trade financing -> trade financing
which is basically -> which is basically
a way to de-risk -> a way to de-risk
to do risk capital -> risk capital
to be borrowed against -> to be borrowed against
or to be lent -> or to be lent
by creating -> by creating
a receipt -> a receipt
of collateral -> of collateral
to be borrowed against -> to be borrowed against
So essentially -> so essentially
when a producer -> when a producer
say deposits -> deposits
a commodity -> a commodity
into a bonded warehouse -> into a bonded warehouse
they'll get issued -> they'll get issued
this receipt -> this receipt
Now with our -> now with our
relationships -> relationships
with bonded warehouses -> with bonded warehouses
we can actually -> we can actually
get that receipt -> get that receipt
issued on chain -> issued on-chain
using an oracle -> using an oracle
in this case -> in this case
using one of -> using one of
Chainlink's oracles -> Chainlink's oracles
coupled with -> coupled with
an IoT device -> an IoT device
that will also -> that will also
give you -> give you
a continuous -> a continuous
kind of -> kind of
proof of existence -> proof of existence
So that either -> so that either
could be -> could be
well -> well
we're still seeing -> we're still seeing
what the different -> what the different
options are -> options are
It could potentially -> it could potentially
be a camera -> be a camera
or it could be -> or it could be
a weight sensor -> a weight sensor
So there there's -> so there are
various different things -> various different things
could be -> it could be
a weight and motion sensor -> a weight and motion sensor
could be weight motion sensor -> could be a weight, motion sensor,
and camera -> and camera
just depends on -> just depends on
the commodity -> the commodity
depends on -> depends on
on -> on
how -> how
granularly want -> granularly you want
to get it -> to get
with the auditing -> with the auditing
of the actual reserve -> of the actual reserve
Yeah -> yeah
so that's basically -> so that's basically
what we're doing -> what we're doing
with them -> with them
And as I mentioned -> and as I mentioned
before -> before
it's not -> it's not
a zero sum game -> a zero-sum game
for us -> for us
with Oracles -> with oracles
In this particular instance -> in this particular instance
we chose Chainlink -> we chose Chainlink
not just because -> not just because
of the function -> of the function
that they have -> that they have
but also because -> but also because
of the size -> of the size
of the network -> of the network
because of -> because of
the various different -> the various different
support -> support
that they provide -> that they provide
for what we -> for what we
need to do -> need to do
However -> however
the plan here -> the plan here
is to utilize -> is to utilize
various oracles -> various oracles
including ergo oracles -> including Ergo oracles
One of the things -> one of the things
that I'm actually -> that I'm actually
thinking of doing -> thinking of doing
is potentially taking -> is potentially taking
some of the capital -> some of the capital
that we have raised -> that we have raised
through -> through
you know -> you know
that as it is -> as it is
being raised -> being raised
to the token sale -> through the token sale
to actually -> to actually
build out -> build out
ergo oracles -> Ergo oracles
because right now -> because right now
we get what -> we get what?
Like two -> like two
right -> right?
So -> so
so it's being -> it's being...
there's one being run -> there's one being run
by the foundation -> by the foundation
and there's -> and there's
one other one -> one other one
So I would like -> so I would like
to build that out -> to build that out
because -> because
yeah -> yeah
ergo oracles -> Ergo oracles
are native -> are native
They're a lot more secure -> they're a lot more secure
But we need -> but we need
to build them out -> to build them out
We need -> we need
to build out -> to build out
the network -> the network
And we need -> and we need
to build out -> to build out
the tooling -> the tooling
around it -> around it
specifically -> specifically
for the use case -> for the use case
in Palmyra -> in Palmyra
So that's also -> so that's also
the plan -> the plan
to kind of invest -> to kind of invest
into the ecosystem -> into the ecosystem
So yeah -> so yeah
that's it -> that's it
in a nutshell -> in a nutshell
Well -> well
this -> this
this -> this
is -> is
the Oracle version one -> the Oracle Pool v1
that's got -> that's got
not just -> not just
the F members -> the EF members
that's got -> that's got
several members -> several members
outside of -> outside of
the F as well -> the EF as well
And then -> and then
there's Oracle version two -> there's Oracle Pool v2
which is -> which is
running -> running
running the -> running the
for gold -> for Dexy Gold
gold -> gold
Dexie -> Dexy
Dexie gold -> Dexy Gold
with court rewards -> with GORT rewards
Yeah -> yeah
I'm thinking -> I'm thinking
of V2 -> of v2
I was thinking -> I was thinking
of V2 -> of v2
And can I -> and can I
just add to that -> just add to that
And I don't want -> and I don't want
to defend you -> to defend you
Dan -> Dan
at all -> at all
So nobody -> so nobody
mistake this -> mistake this
for me defending -> for me defending
Dan -> Dan
But air goods -> but Ergo's
going to be -> going to be
positioned -> positioned
in a place -> in a place
where companies -> where companies
are going to -> are going to
come in -> come in
and use -> and use
an aspect of us -> an aspect of us
or two aspects of us -> or two aspects of us
or three projects of us -> or three aspects of us
or the whole thing -> or the whole thing
and live on us -> and live on us
or maybe -> or maybe
only one part -> only one part
of them -> of them
live on us -> live on us
And we have to -> and we have to
be really careful -> be really careful
about being tribal -> about being tribal
in that sense -> in that sense
and recognize -> and recognize
that -> that
hey -> hey
this company -> this company
doesn't have to -> doesn't have to
be here -> be here
and they're choosing -> and they're choosing
to utilize -> to utilize
a part -> a part
of our ecosystem -> of our ecosystem
and that's -> and that's
a benefit -> a benefit
for us -> for us
So I think -> so I think
our knee-jerk reactions -> our knee-jerk reactions
with these -> with these
kind of things -> kind of things
at least -> at least
in some of -> in some of
the community members -> the community members
can be -> can be
to -> to
be tribalistic -> be tribalistic
and say -> and say
why not all ergo -> why not all Ergo?
But if we're -> but if we're
going to be -> going to be
a supplier -> a supplier

reaching out there -> reaching out there
and the potential -> and the potential
is there -> is there
we have to be -> we have to be
welcoming -> welcoming
We have to be -> we have to be
not grateful -> not grateful
but we have to be -> but we have to be
understanding -> understanding
that we may have -> that we may have
something -> something

To one company -> to one company
but somebody else -> but somebody else
may have -> may have
something -> something
that works -> that works
for them -> for them
at that time -> at that time
too -> too
So they may be -> so they may be
in concert -> in concert
with each other -> with each other
or working together -> or working together
But that's -> but that's
that's how -> that's how
we're gonna succeed -> we're going to succeed
I think -> I think
in this -> in this
in this environment -> in this environment
Yeah -> yeah
no -> no
absolutely -> absolutely
A lot of -> a lot of
these things -> these things
it has to be -> it has to be
a combination -> a combination

So -> so
yeah -> yeah
and like I said -> and like I said
there's various -> there's various
you know -> you know
there's different tools -> there's different tools
for different jobs -> for different jobs

we're obviously -> we're obviously
utilizing ergo -> utilizing Ergo
I mean -> I mean
in fact -> in fact
right now -> right now
everything was -> everything is
running on ergo -> running on Ergo
So -> so
so we -> so we
we are -> we are
we are -> we are
so far -> so far
with ergo exclusive -> Ergo-exclusive
and then -> and then
I have nothing -> I have nothing

All right -> all right
let's go -> let's go
to the next -> to the next
question here -> question here
Let's see -> let's see
Maybe you -> maybe you
QX -> qx()
and then you -> and then you
Alex -> Alex
can comment on this -> can comment on this
Can you talk about -> can you talk about
possible speed -> possible speed
improvements -> improvements
for Ergo -> for Ergo
And this is -> and this is
Captain Ergo -> Captain Ergo
Yeah -> yeah
so we will do -> so we will do
another round -> another round
of discussion -> of discussion
So there are -> so there are
a lot of -> a lot of
community chats -> community chats
some drafts -> some drafts
and so on -> and so on
So yeah -> so yeah
well -> well
I think -> I think
right after -> right after

community text chat -> community text chat
maybe -> maybe
well -> well
all those -> all those
discussions -> discussions
can be revived -> can be revived
right -> right
Well -> well
it's worth -> it's worth
to discuss -> to discuss
and start -> and start
to implement -> to implement
something -> something
Probably -> probably
I mean -> I mean
there are -> there are
some sketches -> some sketches

network objects -> network objects
and so on -> and so on
You can find -> you can find
in one PR then -> in one PR then
Yeah -> yeah
well -> well
some drafts -> some drafts
and discussions -> and discussions
So -> so
well -> well
it would be good -> it would be good
to revive them -> to revive them
So -> so
well -> well
to choose a path -> to choose a path
So -> so
whether sub blocks -> whether sub-blocks

or maybe -> or maybe
also consider -> also consider
sidechains -> sidechains
What's good now -> what's good now?
Why this moment -> why this moment
is good -> is good?
Well -> well
I think -> I think
that's the -> that's the
current set -> current set

increasing throughput -> increasing throughput
then yeah -> then yeah
we have -> we have
a kind of -> a kind of
perfect benchmark -> perfect benchmark
I believe already -> I believe already
right -> right
Because often -> because often
well -> well
some blockchains -> some blockchains
Well -> well
do think -> do think
I don't know -> I don't know
some dubious -> some dubious
support -> support
for layer 2 -> for layer 2
so sharding -> so sharding
or whatever -> or whatever
from day one -> from day one
and then -> and then
yeah -> yeah
well -> well
they do have -> they do have
even years after -> even years after
empty chains -> empty chains
right -> right
and then -> and then
it's not quite clear -> it's not quite clear
I mean -> I mean
why do you need -> why do you need
for parallel chains -> parallel chains
sharding -> sharding
or whatever -> or whatever
if the chain -> if the chain
is empty anyway -> is empty anyway
So -> so
I mean -> I mean
you just spend -> you just spend
block rewards -> block rewards
inefficiently -> inefficiently
basically -> basically
in this case -> in this case
And also -> and also
well -> well
when you don't know -> when you don't know

then -> then
yeah -> yeah
well -> well
it's quite hard -> it's quite hard
to optimize -> to optimize
actually -> actually
That's funny -> that's funny
That's funny question -> that's a funny question
Say go for it -> say, go for it
Now -> now
yeah -> yeah
so with -> so with
a concrete set -> a concrete set
of applications -> of applications
and well -> and well
we can imagine -> we can imagine

also would use -> also would use
the similar design -> the similar design
patterns -> patterns
right -> right
Contracts -> contracts
would be similar -> would be similar
And then -> and then
yeah -> yeah
so for this -> so for this
mix of contracts -> mix of contracts
you have -> you have
on chain -> on-chain
for real -> for real
So -> so
well -> well
yeah -> yeah
it's quite easy -> it's quite easy
to optimize -> to optimize
to consider -> to consider
layer two -> layer 2
So -> so
well -> well

So -> so
yeah -> yeah
well -> well
it's easier now -> it's easier now
Sorry -> sorry
No -> no
no -> no
no -> no
it's funny -> it's funny
I never -> I never
whatever this -> whenever this
conversation -> conversation
comes up -> comes up
about faster blocks -> about faster blocks
or -> or
speeding up -> speeding up
the chain -> the chain
I always think -> I always think
the first thing -> the first thing
I went to -> I went to
was -> was
Oh -> oh
you know -> you know
what about -> what about
contracts -> contracts
that are based -> that are based
on block height -> on block height
and not -> and not
uh -> uh
you know -> you know
for time -> for time
as opposed -> as opposed
to actually -> to actually
the timestamp -> the timestamp
would be affected -> would be affected
But it's funny -> but it's funny
It never occurred -> it never occurred
to me -> to me
that -> that
with increased -> with increased

are going to -> are going to
tail out -> tail off
are going to -> are going to
run out -> run out
much -> much
much faster -> much faster
right -> right
Depending on -> depending on
what you do -> what you do
So unless -> so unless
that's correct then -> that's correct then
So that's interesting -> so that's interesting
But for people -> but for people
who are interested -> who are interested
there's a channel -> there's a channel
when -> when
a few people -> a few people
are interested -> are interested
but of course -> but of course
these kind of things -> these kinds of things
take some -> take some
motivation -> motivation
in somebody -> in somebody
to lead it -> to lead it
We have -> we have
kind of -> kind of
a test net -> a testnet
set up -> set up
for tweaking -> for tweaking
parameters -> parameters
on Ergo -> on Ergo
that would be -> that would be
you know -> you know
changing -> changing
the difficulty level -> the difficulty level
those kind of things -> those kinds of things
so if somebody -> so if somebody
is interested -> is interested
and that's something -> and that's something
you're really -> you're really
passionate about -> passionate about
and you don't even -> and you don't even
need really -> need to really
no code -> know code
you just -> you just
kind of -> kind of
need to -> need to
come in -> come in
