# Ergo Blockchain Community Call Summary
**Date:** 2025-06-27  
**Title:** RustChain | Scott Boudreaux | ErgoHack 10

## Executive Summary

This community call featured Scott Boudreaux (founder of Elian Labs) presenting his ErgoHack 10 submission: RustChain, an innovative blockchain system built on Ergo that introduces "Proof of Antiquity" consensus mechanism. RustChain aims to create a sustainable ecosystem that validates transactions based on hardware age rather than computational power, effectively creating a "living computer museum" that preserves old hardware while maintaining network security. The project includes an AI governance system called Sophia Core that can make autonomous decisions on blockchain proposals while incorporating human oversight.

Boudreaux demonstrated a working proof-of-concept including wallet functionality, transaction processing, block explorer, and AI-driven governance decisions. The system is designed to work alongside existing mining operations without reducing hashrate, uses low power consumption, and keeps older hardware out of landfills. The project represents an intersection of sustainability, historical preservation, and blockchain innovation, with plans for cross-chain interoperability with Ergo and NFT-based mining rate boosts.

## Key Discussion Points

• **Proof of Antiquity Consensus**: Revolutionary approach that validates based on hardware age using BIOS/firmware timestamps rather than computational power
• **Sustainability Focus**: System designed to repurpose old hardware, reduce energy consumption, and prevent electronic waste
• **AI Governance Integration**: Sophia Core protocol enabling AI-driven decision making with human oversight mechanisms  
• **Cross-chain Interoperability**: Planned integration with Ergo blockchain as potential sidechain for asset transfers and data sharing
• **NFT Mining Rewards**: Future implementation of NFTs that can boost mining rates for community contributions
• **Living Computer Museum**: Philosophical approach to honoring historical computing hardware that enabled modern blockchain technology
• **Technical Demonstration**: Live demo showing wallet generation, transactions, block explorer, and AI governance decisions

## Decisions Made

• Scott requested community feedback on cross-chain interoperability plans with Ergo
• Demonstrated functional proof-of-concept ready for community testing and development
• Established bounty system for community contributions (e.g., Apple II TCP/IP stack implementation)
• Presented complete system including documentation, code, and demo wallets for community evaluation
