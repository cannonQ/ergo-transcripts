[00:10] **qx()**: Happy New Year, Ergo.
[00:12] **qx()**: Welcome to 2025.
[00:14] **qx()**: How you doing, kushti?
[00:15] **kushti**: Happy New Year, guys.
[00:16] **kushti**: So yeah, I'm now trying to update a pinned post in the Telegram group.
[00:25] **qx()**: What's a pinned post in the Telegram group?
[00:28] **kushti**: Oh, so this is my announcement, actually.
[00:31] **qx()**: Oh, nice.
[00:32] **qx()**: Perfect.
[00:34] **kushti**: A bit late, but anyway, so yeah, it's just January 2nd, right?
[00:40] **kushti**: So everything is still quite chilling.

[00:47] **qx()**: Yeah, catching up on sleep, starting a new year. Have you done anything fascinating already this year, kushti?

[00:56] **kushti**: Not quite, so I'm actually working on sub-blocks CEP, so planning to present it, I don't know, like tonight or tomorrow, something like that, but yeah, just slowly working on that.
[01:15] **kushti**: We've been interrupted constantly, so yeah, let's see.
[01:22] **kushti**: Not sure it will be done today, but yeah, I'm working.

[01:28] **qx()**: Well, that's exciting. You think sub-blocks will see them, we'll see them, at least some proof of concept testing soon.

[01:37] **kushti**: Yeah. So what I'm working now is how to pack transactions into input blocks sub-blocks right and yeah then how to update state and yeah, what could be rules for different transactions because some transactions are depending on, well, block header contents, right, so predicted block header, so basically next block and, yeah, so validity of transaction can be changed from one input block to another.

[02:24] **kushti**: So, well, the current proposal is to allow them in order or ordering blocks only so well full blocks right in terminology so like every two minutes on them but they are like 99% of transactions it's possible to well, confirm them immediately.
[02:49] **kushti**: And then, yeah, the question is how to update state, how to form candidates and so on. So you're working on that.
[02:55] **kushti**: And yeah, so once this is fully clear and there is some prototype code, then yeah, I think other parts are quite straightforward.
[03:07] **kushti**: But yeah, still a lot of work, but yeah.

[03:13] **kushti**: I think in a few days it would be quite clear how to get and what could be time estimation about getting through the hardest part.
[03:29] **kushti**: So these transactions forming and state updating and then, yeah, it's more or less straightforward.
[03:39] **kushti**: A lot of work, but yeah, quite straightforward.

[03:44] **kushti**: All right. So is my sound good?
[03:47] **kushti**: It sounds great, kushti.
[03:49] **qx()**: It's doing great.

[03:52] **qx()**: Well, on our side, the Sigmanauts mining DAO is launching a meme token that we found during storage rent collection.
[04:06] **qx()**: So for those of you that don't know, if there's a box that's reached its age of four years and it doesn't have enough ERG to cover storage rent, the whole box is destroyed and claimable by miners.
[04:20] **qx()**: And if that box contains any tokens, those tokens also go to the miners.
[04:24] **qx()**: So there's a token that CannonQ launched with the new launch platform and it's a PHP token.
[04:32] **qx()**: It's meant to be a meme token that is gonna be educating.
[04:37] **qx()**: So I think there's still some room left if you guys want to help out with that launch.
[04:43] **qx()**: But it's kind of a cool concept as we come along.

[04:53] **qx()**: I think we got lucky with that. I think we got the whole supply of PHP.
[04:56] **qx()**: Somebody had made it as a test token four years ago and left it in one box.
[05:02] **qx()**: We're not going to get that lucky as time goes on, but there are some cool tokens that were made early on that we will hopefully grab if we do happen to get those blocks stuffed in there for that.
[05:17] **qx()**: So super, super fun concept. They're kind of recycling and rebirthing these meme projects as storage rent collects them.

[05:25] **qx()**: Super neat. Do you remember what that was? Do you remember what that token was back then, kushti?

[05:33] **kushti**: No, any idea who minted it.
[05:36] **qx()**: I don't know. He found the wallet. He found out where it came from, what exchange it came from. They brought money from an exchange and bought ERG from an exchange, brought them over and minted the token and then send the ERG back.
[05:49] **qx()**: And that was it, I think for that transaction. So specifically who it is.

[05:55] **kushti**: Yeah, I don't know if you show me address, maybe I can tell because back then there were not many people able to mint tokens, maybe.
[06:05] **kushti**: But actually there were wallets back then with token minting, so.

[06:10] **qx()**: Oh, wow. So somebody may have just been playing around and hit a button and then exited kind of thing.
[06:18] **qx()**: Pretty neat. Yeah. What do it stands for? If it's like the web PHP or some other.

[06:25] **kushti**: Who knows, I mean, that's just me today. But yeah, I mean, there are some addresses I can tell about, like Scala Hubs, for example.
[06:38] **kushti**: And yeah, there were a few other folks playing with tokens back then.
[06:44] **kushti**: But they also could be just some coin barn wallets user.
[06:49] **kushti**: So yeah, that's what it's supported. Talking meeting back then.

[06:57] **qx()**: Okay. Interesting. Very cool.

[07:01] **qx()**: So there's that. We also in the mining pool, we had a fun little bet that I offered in chat.
[07:08] **qx()**: I said if we mine a token within the first 69 minutes of 2025, I'd donate 50 ERG worth of project tokens to the bonus token wallet.
[07:21] **qx()**: And we found one with like four minutes to spare.
[07:25] **qx()**: So Mark, I think it's going to be distributing those over some new, I sent over some Paideia, some air Doge, or no, some Bober and one of the things as well.
[07:38] **qx()**: So Mark should be sending those out soon to current miners of the Sigmanauts mining pool.

[07:44] **qx()**: Oh, Kevin says Philippines is what PHP stood for. It must be in the description perhaps. Super neat.

[07:51] **kushti**: So he does now Philippines. Yeah, well, no idea. But yeah, so probably some Sigmanauts from Philippines then.

[08:07] **qx()**: Gotcha. So that's Sigmanauts mining DAO. That's going nice and strong.

[08:12] **qx()**: Oh, I got a Christmas present, kushti. And it's like a handheld gaming computer.
[08:20] **qx()**: But here's the first thing that I put on it fully.
[08:24] **kushti**: Oh, nice.
[08:25] **qx()**: Yeah, so the thing runs, let me click on it. The thing will run with controller mapping, which is really handy.

[08:41] **kushti**: Nice here.
[08:43] **qx()**: Everything works very nicely, very smoothly. You can remap the E and the K keys. You can car race.
[08:48] **qx()**: I find it much, much easier on a device like this.
[08:53] **qx()**: So I can't wait till Cyberverse comes to mobile.
[08:59] **qx()**: That's going to be fantastic.

[09:00] **qx()**: And speaking of Cyberverse, they also have their Ronin Mint coming up on, I believe, the January 6th, where they're doing cross-chain.
[09:10] **qx()**: Everybody knows they're on Cardano already, but also the Ronin network, where they won that competition and placement there.
[09:17] **qx()**: So there's going to be a mint there. So if any of you guys want to get some exclusive NFTs that are just minted on the Ronin side, then you can follow their tweet and whitelist your wallet.
[09:29] **qx()**: And have fun over there as well. Super cool.

[09:32] **qx()**: But I mean, it's hard to ignore the fact of what the recognized value of Cyberverse has done since Ronin, since they've won that competition at Ronin.
[09:45] **qx()**: So I'm really interested to see what's going to happen. Right now there's almost a hundred players live on a Cyberverse, which is quite a high watermark, but I've seen.
[09:55] **qx()**: So super exciting for that.

[09:57] **qx()**: If you have a Steam Deck or one of these guys, try it out. Remap the keys. It's absolutely fantastic.
[10:03] **qx()**: It makes mining a breeze when you're mining Cyberian Ores and watching TV kind of thing. It makes it super easy.

[10:12] **qx()**: Yeah. All right. What else? Sigmanauts are doing strong with our new multi-sig.
[10:21] **qx()**: I think we started a transaction to send some tokens for a little bit of liquidation or donation. I think it was as a vote upon idea that we pass that we're just executing.
[10:32] **qx()**: So that's going very well.

[10:33] **qx()**: I've also tried to set myself some goals for 2025 quarter one at least and that is one of them is to help organize the Rosen Bridge guards a little better see if we can get some automations there and get that going as well as some other things But yeah, that's pretty much it for the initial start of the new year trying to wipe the sleep off my eyes kushti, what about you?

[11:01] **qx()**: What are your plans besides the blocks?

[11:03] **kushti**: Yeah, so discussing with developers in Ergo Developers Group what could be realistic and nice plan for 2025.
[11:15] **kushti**: Which is, yeah, so what I proposed and what I'm thinking about is mostly oriented towards what I'm calling peer-to-peer digital free banking, including options for peer-to-peer smart contracts powered on ramp for Ergo and also cross-chain tests, which would be huge, especially for assets which are now well-being ignored, right, censored by centralized exchanges such as privacy coins, right, and well, proof of work assets to some degree.

[12:17] **kushti**: Then, yeah, so I think well, with sub-blocks still, there is need for some layer 2s, right? Well, the only question is what are desirable properties and what's concrete layer 2s, right? Would be beneficial.

[12:45] **kushti**: So I think there is I need to start discussions, right? Well, applications are already there and we can think about optimizations about it.
[13:01] **kushti**: But yeah, so the idea is to have, what do we need to have is peer-to-peer on-ramp, right? Uncensorable, decentralized on-ramp.

[13:17] **kushti**: Yeah, I mean, for most of DeFi, the Ergo network is already working quite fine, right? So, well, getting along in minutes, right, is already... I mean, in peer-to-peer setting, I mean, like issuing bonds and getting it filled, like it's already a big deal.

[13:46] **kushti**: Well, we need for speeds, maybe low fees, specific use cases like, well, money transfers, right? where some stablecoin based layer 2s would be beneficial than what's on ramp contracts.
[14:15] **kushti**: Maybe, but yeah, so if it's about multi-sig escrow, then yeah, so even current network is enough probably.

[14:32] **qx()**: So how do peer-to-peer via on-ramps work?

[14:37] **kushti**: Also, there is a forum post by Mr. Stahlfeiger on Ergoforum, but basically the idea is to use somewhat like Bisq, maybe a UI like that, but yeah, with on-chain escrows.

[14:56] **qx()**: So we're talking that miners would, let's take miners for example, if people are mining 20, 30 ERG a day with their big rigs and they have, you know, saved up hundreds and thousands of ERG and somebody comes in on this peer-to-peer fiat arm ramp, essentially it'd be a bid.
[15:14] **qx()**: They'd say, okay, I'm selling the ERG for this much or I want to buy the ERG for this much.
[15:19] **qx()**: And the contractor would look for some off-chain oracle that this cash transaction happened in the fiat world, so it would release the ERG? Or how would that work?

[15:35] **kushti**: Oh, so, yeah, well, maybe it's better to put ergoforum post from Mr. Stahlfeiger.
[15:47] **kushti**: But yeah, basically it's like a multi-sig escrow, right, from participating in the exchange.
[15:58] **kushti**: Yeah, and maybe some arbiter party.
[16:04] **kushti**: So that's how hodl-hodl, for example, working for Bitcoin.

[16:14] **qx()**: I see.

[16:16] **kushti**: And yeah, so there is need for UI, but maybe even MewFinance is cross would be not.
[16:25] **kushti**: But yeah, I mean, we need to find, we need to start experimenting and then find, right, so what could be proper UI and well, concrete schemes around that.

[16:40] **kushti**: Then, yeah, so transfers, Then there is need for more stable coins.
[16:53] **kushti**: There are already talks started about a new USD pool.
[16:58] **kushti**: Finally, here people are organizing the

[17:06] **kushti**: Then there is some work towards silver, right, oracle.
[17:15] **kushti**: Then there are plans to tokenize lithium with also having physical lithium in the equation.
[17:24] **kushti**: And then, yeah, so with all those assets and cross-chain assets, the next step I believe is to have well-expanding tools for well monetary expansion right for expanding monetary supply on top of monetary base which is about ERG and other blockchains like ChainCash and so on but yeah that's the next step right so it's a bit later to get done.

[18:00] **kushti**: So yeah, well, that's what I have in mind.
[18:03] **kushti**: But there is a lot of other people in the community building with different visions.
[18:15] **kushti**: I don't know, physicals, right? Selling physical stuff.

[18:20] **qx()**: Right, right. We just sold, we sold three Mac, no, four Mac Pros, I believe. We shipped one to middle Europe, three to the US.
[18:29] **qx()**: And then I just sold my wife's personal M1 16 inch MacBook Pro from 2021 or two or whatever that year is. as well because she got a new one for Christmas it was amazing it was fantastic I'm actually about to ship that out today after I leave work to Western Europe so it's insane how easy it is to do you know mint a token with the information

[18:57] **qx()**: Post it up on MewMart and then just wait.
[19:03] **qx()**: It is interesting though, kushti, it's kind of a game to where you're like, okay, do I list it in ERG so that it's more attractive for people just to swipe it up?
[19:14] **qx()**: Or do I list it in SigmaUSD because I'm worried about maybe a 10% price drop or a 10% price increase, and then I'll have to be listed after that.
[19:25] **qx()**: So it's interesting the process of listing, of choosing what you're going to do.

[19:31] **qx()**: I decided to list in ERG just because it was easy, and the price did dip a little bit from when I listed it.
[19:37] **qx()**: But I was watching it and then of course it went back up now.
[19:41] **qx()**: So it doesn't matter in the end but it was super neat.

[19:45] **qx()**: So yeah, I encourage everybody if you have items that you want to sell ever and you want to become a seller talk to HQx at MewMart and get certified for a seller

[20:01] **qx()**: I think he's got a robust list of personal questions about your... No, I'm just kidding. I don't know what he asks.
[20:09] **qx()**: But it's going to be based on trust, of course.
[20:11] **qx()**: So if you screw people over, you're going to be pulled immediately.
[20:15] **qx()**: And if you're an unknown entity, you're not going to be probably allowed to list there.
[20:21] **qx()**: So that's kind of the trust thing there.

[20:24] **qx()**: So yeah, I encourage you guys to go there and look at it I'm gonna probably post some more things kicking around my house and I think we have some Mac minis I said here that we can raise money for the Cornell DAO as well That we can post as well, you know those kind of they're like i5 Mac minis with 16 gigs of ram or something like that good for good for little headless servers somewhere Yeah, so stay tuned for that physicals are really really cool.

[20:50] **qx()**: It's so nice to not have to you know, I guess a good thing for the, for the seller, at least my wife was saying, oh, should we, you know, should, do we ship it yet?
[21:00] **qx()**: Do you know the money's not in our bank?
[21:02] **qx()**: Should we ship it yet?
[21:03] **qx()**: And I was like, yeah, yeah, we can ship it.
[21:04] **qx()**: I said, the money got sent via a smart contract.
[21:08] **qx()**: I mean, it's in my wallet.
[21:09] **qx()**: It's not like PayPal can claw back.
[21:11] **qx()**: It's there for good.
[21:13] **qx()**: You know, so it was a really nice as a seller to know that, you know, the buyer's not going to screw me over at all.

[21:22] **kushti**: But here, Escrow also could be used, right?
[21:26] **kushti**: You could, yeah, 100%. Teller and some trusted watcher, right?

[21:31] **qx()**: Yep, yep. Speaking of that too, I spoke with, speaking of Escrow and fundraising at least, I spoke with Quokka for an update as well as Crass and

[21:46] **qx()**: And Quokka sent me the front end that he's been working on that's done essentially for the new Sky Harbor and the guy working on the smart contracts.
[21:58] **qx()**: I think the deal was they had an in real life job that was extremely demanding, which I mean, an excuse is an excuse.
[22:04] **qx()**: And it's been a while since the fundraiser.
[22:07] **qx()**: But I'll keep pushing on them on quokka to get that out.

[22:12] **qx()**: And that brought up another topic, kushti, about some sort of escrow fundraising.
[22:16] **qx()**: So the idea would be, at least we discussed it in the Sigmanauts.
[22:20] **qx()**: The idea would be that if you fundraise, those funds could go into a smart contract and then a third party could say, okay, here's a milestone you've met, we're gonna give you a third of the fundraising.
[22:32] **qx()**: Here's another milestone, we'll give you another third of the fundraising.
[22:35] **qx()**: Here's a final done, okay, we'll give you the last third.
[22:38] **qx()**: So I think that's a great way to go in the future.
[22:40] **qx()**: Then we're not stuck at these periods where, hey, where's the product?
[22:45] **qx()**: You fundraised eight months ago, and it should have been done in three months, and you still haven't done it kind of thing.
[22:50] **qx()**: So we can avoid those things.

[22:53] **qx()**: Manually, I think Sigmanauts are positioned to be able to do that right now.
[22:56] **qx()**: If anybody wants to fundraise as a project and do that, you can put our treasury as the address.
[23:01] **qx()**: We can track it actually in a sub address, a derived address in our multi-sig, and we can track it.
[23:08] **qx()**: and release based on the terms set in the auction that people agree to.
[23:12] **qx()**: So happy to do that now as Sigmanauts if anybody wants to fundraise and kind of do that.
[23:17] **qx()**: But of course, probably HQx might be working on something else as well at some point, as if he's not busy enough with his new life kind of thing.

[23:26] **qx()**: So yeah, that's really exciting and super fun, I think.

[23:33] **qx()**: Yeah. What time is it? 9.25. We got maybe got some questions.

[23:37] **kushti**: Yeah, so not so much updates this week. There was no developers chat yesterday, obviously.

[23:50] **qx()**: Yeah, holidays really take a burden on people, that's for sure.

[23:55] **kushti**: looking forward towards 2025 so it seems that there is increased interest now and yeah it's getting well more and more hot topic so

[24:12] **kushti**: Well, people do understand the value of decentralized communities, right? Well, it seems again.

[24:21] **qx()**: It's funny, kushti, it's funny you say that, because I think people understand I think people understand their desire for one, right?
[24:31] **qx()**: But I don't think they put a definition, at least mainstream.
[24:35] **qx()**: You see influences every once in a while.
[24:37] **qx()**: I'd say every week.
[24:38] **qx()**: There's some sort of eureka moment by some stupid influencer who's like, oh, you know, if only there was this project that was decentralized and peer to peer and didn't do rugpulls and didn't do this and actually had utility and was doing stuff.
[24:55] **qx()**: And it's like, OK, you know the issue, but you're too daft to understand or actually participate in the execution of it, like Ergo and those kind of things.
[25:05] **qx()**: So it's funny.
[25:06] **qx()**: I think people recognize the lack, but slowly, slowly we see them trickling over and making that connection to the actual realized product, which is Ergo.
[25:18] **qx()**: So I always laugh when I see those posts.

[25:23] **kushti**: Yeah, so actually, well, I'm participating now with talks with some big influencers, right?
[25:29] **kushti**: And yeah, it seems that they see value, right? And all that stuff.
[25:34] **kushti**: The only problem is that they are trying to extract value as well as they know how to do that, right?
[25:44] **kushti**: So I mean... They do. just to find Ergo and making a deal so I mean it's quite interesting that they are looking for a project what they call a blockchain project without basically then they are trying to make a deal with it right there so

[26:14] **kushti**: That's a little bit skinny. Right. Yeah. I mean, that's the current state.
[26:23] **kushti**: So I think it would be, we will get back to 2019, 2020, something like that.
[26:34] **kushti**: Hopefully in coming months.

[26:39] **kushti**: We need to have all those people, so it's not just the own issue.
[26:48] **kushti**: That's how the whole space was shaped in the last few years.
[27:01] **kushti**: For example, centralized exchanges.
[27:04] **kushti**: like everything in the space is just blockchain with team it's not even to explain them that the different options then yeah well influence and so on so the so well getting corrupted with it's right but yeah well I'm quite positive about

[27:35] **kushti**: Well, what's known in the community, right?
[27:38] **kushti**: How well, different, mechanism balance and check forming and, how are different, coming, wouldn't, do, any demo to, to, to, to eat with, ERG right financial interests or what's the business financial interest and so on so when i used to be a pro phonics so yeah we had some big guy you know coming and making calls developed co-co-op receiving for some reason and well

[28:29] **kushti**: Half of developers were anonymous, they made some type instead of jabber chat.
[28:41] **kushti**: Even in such environment they tried to get some commitments from co-developers showing the rights of certain players.
[28:58] **kushti**: with a core development space.

[29:12] **kushti**: Hopefully we will see it here, but we will prepare anyway.
[29:22] **kushti**: I mean, we need to prepare for a big, because anyway, they will cut it.
[29:30] **kushti**: And then, yeah, the query is how to avoid corruption.

[29:40] **qx()**: Yeah. You're breaking up space. You're breaking up a little bit, kushti. You want to kill some bots on your machine?

[29:49] **kushti**: Oh, I have a few problems here that are kind of critical, so probably not now.
[29:57] **kushti**: Let's continue. I mean, if it's, if it's okay.

[30:02] **qx()**: No, you're okay. You're about 90%. So it's not terrible. We get what you're saying.

[30:09] **qx()**: Yeah. Back to influences part. I'm hesitant to, I was hesitant to call them in floors, influencers when in actuality they're not influences.
[30:18] **qx()**: They're promoters. They're being paid. to promote a product, whether they believe in it or not.
[30:25] **qx()**: I think a true influencer is trend setting and setting a trend based on what they believe in and what's great and something that's actually that they're involved in naturally and organically.
[30:41] **qx()**: That's an influencer.
[30:42] **qx()**: So these things we see on YouTube and Twitter, those people are promoters.
[30:47] **qx()**: They're paid promoters.

[30:49] **qx()**: So it's a really I wish people could see the difference.
[30:52] **qx()**: There are people out there that are influencers that take the time, that discover things and are doing it because they actually utilize the product and maybe have self invested in the product because they believe in the product and then they preach about it.
[31:09] **qx()**: That's an influencer and they set trends.
[31:12] **qx()**: Most of the stuff we see out there right now are promoters, that's for sure.
[31:18] **qx()**: It's given me really sour taste for those kinds of things, at least.

[31:25] **qx()**: Oh, kushti, we have to pick some random numbers for the ErgoSanta for MewFinance right now.

[31:36] **kushti**: All right. All right. Yeah. So it's got to be the range.

[31:42] **qx()**: Why don't you pick a number from 25 and a half to 50 and I'll pick a number from one to 25. and a half you ready so from 25 to 50 yeah you go 25 to 50 I'll go one to 25 all right let me think so you start on me I'll go first I'm going to pick 13 all right 13 is my number what's yours kushti

[32:16] **kushti**: 13, so let's... 25 to 51.
[32:21] **kushti**: 25 to 51, so 48.

[32:28] **qx()**: All right, 13 and 48, there you go, HQx.
[32:30] **qx()**: So for those of you that don't know, ErgoSanta is a fun little thing that's been running for a couple years now.
[32:36] **qx()**: People donate things to projects and people donate things to an address.
[32:41] **qx()**: And then you go and buy tickets and you open those tickets and it's part of that distribution.
[32:47] **qx()**: And then there's some grand prizes.
[32:49] **qx()**: So we just drew the random tickets.

[32:54] **qx()**: I'm wrong, HQx? Oh, whatever. 13 and what'd you say 48 kushti? 48 yeah yeah so yeah perfect all right yes h here we got you 51 buddy

[33:11] **qx()**: Perfect. Great.

[33:13] **qx()**: All right, what's next? Should we try to hit some questions, kushti? Let's see what we have.
[33:17] **qx()**: Oh yeah, let's try.

[33:19] **qx()**: Okay. I've been told to stop swearing because kids are watching. Noted white cat.
[33:24] **qx()**: I will refrain from the field of F's that I've been saying.

[33:30] **qx()**: Let's see. We have, Jonas, Jonas would like to know, do we have multi-sig wallets on Ergo?

[33:41] **qx()**: We do. We do. We have a very cool multi-sig called Minotaur right now, which is on version two.
[33:50] **qx()**: Huge upgrade from version one.
[33:52] **qx()**: They're still, I think, in the pipeline working on built-in messaging so that you don't have to manually transfer the signatures to each other with Google Sheets or something else like that.
[34:03] **qx()**: or the commitments, but it works very well.
[34:06] **qx()**: We just did a transaction test a couple weeks ago on version two of the Sigmanauts treasury.
[34:12] **qx()**: We pounded it out in like 30 minutes after some struggles with learning, but it's pretty good.

[34:19] **qx()**: And then kushti, we also have MGPi is kind of on the back burner, but he's developed a multi-sig called Moria.
[34:26] **qx()**: which is a web-based multi-sig.
[34:29] **qx()**: You go there, you connect Nautilus to it, and right now I think it's a test version of Nautilus, a special build, because there had to be a little tweak to it to work.
[34:40] **qx()**: So you connect that to it, and that's your signing key, and the server handles the rest of the stuff.
[34:46] **qx()**: So you sign, it tells you who's next, and then they sign, it tells you who's next, it stores it all, and then it submits it for you.
[34:54] **qx()**: That will be a much, much easier multi-sig experience than Minotaur and passing the signing keys around or the signing JSON around yourself after you sign it.
[35:05] **qx()**: But I think we're waiting on some code being inserted into the final build of the production.

[35:11] **kushti**: Yeah, there is need for centralized server here.

[35:15] **qx()**: I know. Yeah, there is.

[35:17] **kushti**: Yeah. But yeah, I think there is also some alternative work on multisig server, right, for Nautilus, but I've forgotten.
[35:29] **kushti**: Maybe by Captain Nemo even.

[35:39] **qx()**: I mean, well, the trick is centralization of holding those JSON signatures and commits while it's in the process.
[35:49] **qx()**: So for those of you that don't know how multi-sigs work, you have a wallet that's your signing key that's essentially your password, right?
[35:56] **qx()**: And then it combines all those public keys of your signing keys and creates a smart contract that's the multi-sig that only allows threshold spending based on four out of seven, three out of six, three out of five, depending on how many yes signatures you need to push it forward.

[36:13] **qx()**: So there's two rounds in these scenarios.
[36:17] **qx()**: There's a commit round where you sign it.
[36:20] **qx()**: And then there's a signing round where you continue back up the tree and you sign again to actually sign it after the commit.
[36:27] **qx()**: And then the last person in line publishes it.

[36:30] **qx()**: So the idea is you have to pass around this sometimes you know, 50,000 character string of JSON file, and it builds as people tack their signatures on.
[36:41] **qx()**: So right now, we use Google Sheets for Minotaur and most of the multi-sigs that I'm part of, and you just paste it in the cell and you copy the previous one and you do that and you copy the previous one, paste it in, that kind of thing.
[36:54] **qx()**: So that works, but sometimes when you have a lot of outputs, and a lot of inputs, you run into a 50,000 character limit in a cell in Google Docs.
[37:06] **qx()**: So then for the old Sigmanauts multi-sig that we had to extract everything out of to the new one, we ended up just passing a text file around in the chat.

[37:18] **qx()**: Yeah, there's the issue of, like Moria Finance, do you centralize that process and go from there?
[37:27] **qx()**: Or do you develop some sort of on-chain messaging system, which I thought was Captain Nemo's or Minotaur's idea that they would try to implement something like that in the future where there's some sort of on-chain messaging where maybe the JSON is submitted to a block and that's looked for and brought up there kind of thing, or maybe it just hits a mempool and then vanishes, who knows?
[37:52] **qx()**: It could be anything, but yeah, definitely trade-offs in that, kushti.

[37:56] **qx()**: I mean, what are the chances that if I start a commit, kushti, and I'm multising, there is not much a centralized entity could do to screw with it, right?
[38:08] **qx()**: If before the next person commits to it, right? They would be known that it was messed with or could it be messed with along the pathway?

[38:15] **kushti**: Yeah, but so you know what's good about multi-sig and Ergo.
[38:21] **kushti**: So what makes it unique in comparison with other blockchains?
[38:25] **kushti**: So here is threshold signatures is real cryptographic threshold signature.
[38:30] **kushti**: So it is preserving zero knowledge, right?
[38:33] **kushti**: So for example, if there is you, me and Joe in a signing rig and two out of three signatures are needed, right?
[38:45] **kushti**: And you and me are signing them.
[38:48] **kushti**: Not any external observer knows that, right?
[38:51] **kushti**: And if we are doing that complicated procedure, then yeah, well, this privacy is preserved, right, in the ring.
[38:59] **kushti**: So only three of us.

[39:01] **kushti**: I actually know, right, who are your real signers, right?
[39:07] **kushti**: Because, well, in this case, Joe also knows that, you know, he didn't sign.
[39:13] **kushti**: And then, yeah, it's possible to conclude who are the signers.
[39:19] **kushti**: But, yeah, it's not possible to prove, maybe, but you need to check, actually.
[39:25] **kushti**: I mean, Joe cannot prove that to outside world.
[39:30] **kushti**: But I need to check that.
[39:32] **kushti**: I mean, if just two of us were in the signing ceremony.
[39:37] **kushti**: But yeah, so the server also knows, right, who are the miners for real.

[39:46] **kushti**: So in addition to Moria and Minotaur wallets, which is usable and actually quite good right now, I'm using it.
[40:00] **kushti**: So there is also alt application, desktop application, zero knowledge treasury, which can be used.
[40:07] **kushti**: It's kind of simple DAO tooling, so you can create proposals there.
[40:11] **kushti**: And yeah, basically what with multi-signature.

[40:22] **qx()**: Is that what the EF used?

[40:24] **kushti**: Not yet, so it was used by some Dark Funds, Zero Funds, which was made of me, Philippo Units, Martin MX, back in 2020.
[40:39] **kushti**: So we donated some money, received some donations to support some privacy-oriented projects on Ergo.
[40:48] **kushti**: And yeah, so this tooling is using multi-sig for kind of voting rights.
[40:54] **kushti**: So you can create proposal and then, yeah, other signers are signing or not.
[41:00] **kushti**: And if enough signatures collected, then payment is done.
[41:05] **kushti**: So kind of a very simple DAO tooling, actually.
[41:09] **kushti**: And yeah, also with preserving privacy of waters, which is quite, quite interesting also.

[41:18] **qx()**: Speaking of privacy, kushti, I saw a question on the line yesterday. I think it was. They're running the open source tool mixer.
[41:30] **qx()**: And they're wondering if they could change the hops after they've already submitted.
[41:35] **qx()**: So if they wanted to augment or increase the amount of hops it takes while they're in the middle of a mix, do they have to wait for the mix to finish?
[41:42] **qx()**: Or can they change that on the fly?
[41:45] **qx()**: Do you know? Have you ever come across that before?

[41:49] **kushti**: Yeah, so I think you need to wait and start a new mix.

[41:56] **qx()**: Gotcha. Okay. That makes sense.

[41:58] **qx()**: All right, let's see. White cat wants to know is Dan still in the team?
[42:04] **qx()**: I'm not sure what he means by in the team in the team. He's an Ergonaut or not.
[42:08] **qx()**: Yeah. Dan's sleepy. It's like 2 a.m. In Japan right now.
[42:13] **qx()**: And Dan's been doing a lot of traveling to Argentina, for the lithium, lithium mining kind of stuff that they're working on with Palmyra.
[42:22] **qx()**: So Dan is very much around.
[42:24] **qx()**: I wished him a happy new year, Merry Christmas.
[42:27] **qx()**: And he was alive and well.
[42:29] **qx()**: So I think he's in Japan right now.

[42:34] **qx()**: So I think he, I think he got back near Christmas time or so.
[42:40] **qx()**: Yeah. Dan and Japan. Yep.

[42:43] **qx()**: So we'll try to have Dan on again. It's interesting, because either people hate Dan or they ask where he is.
[42:50] **qx()**: There's never an in between for Dan.
[42:54] **qx()**: So this will make Dan happy that he's wanted by white cat.
[42:57] **qx()**: I'm going to picture this and make an NFT out of it for Dan.

[43:01] **qx()**: All right, let's see. Oh, here we go. qx() and kushti, what are you guys grateful for on this new year period?
[43:12] **qx()**: This is from Gabno.

[43:16] **qx()**: What are you grateful for, kushti? On or off chain?

[43:20] **kushti**: Is it the question?
[43:23] **kushti**: Yeah, yeah. What are you grateful for? On or off chain?

[43:27] **qx()**: Well, he didn't say, so I'm going to say, I'm going to leave it open for you.

[43:32] **kushti**: I mean, what do I prefer on chain? What do you think?

[43:37] **qx()**: What are you thankful for in life and in crypto in your experience with crypto in life?
[43:43] **qx()**: Give just what do you what are you thankful for? Are grateful for? I'll go first.

[43:52] **qx()**: You want me to go first?

[43:55] **kushti**: Yeah, so still, well, what I'm interested in is, yeah, to have crypto for real, you know, so for like, I don't know, so, you know, there are a lot of interesting experiments in how to call this even, like virtual space, you know, like, I don't know.

[44:19] **kushti**: Well, those games like CryptoKitties, then what do we have?

[44:37] **kushti**: like i don't know so some tokens with meme coins without utility and so on, right?
[44:50] **kushti**: But yeah, so what's good, what I'm interested in connecting, right?
[44:58] **kushti**: Like, well, cryptography and cryptographic assets, cryptographically secure assets with real world, you know, needs.
[45:12] **kushti**: So that's the most interesting thing.
[45:15] **kushti**: So then, yeah, cryptography per se, but yeah, I mean, there is need for applications, right?
[45:22] **kushti**: Otherwise you can spend decades with just playing fancy.

[45:30] **kushti**: games here like I don't know like iterating our different cryptographic schemes and so on like well discussing the properties maybe proving something coming up with the new schemes and so on but

[45:50] **kushti**: Yeah, I mean at some point I think there is need for real-world applications otherwise it's just I don't know so it's about getting grants or just I don't know some game in isolated space which is not very interesting to me.
[46:14] **kushti**: But then, yeah, also, well, software development programming. But yeah, it's also that there is need for real-world applications.

[46:28] **qx()**: All right, cool. Cool.

[46:31] **qx()**: I would say I'm most grateful for the time that we're, I guess, the timeline we're in, right?
[46:38] **qx()**: So sometimes I think, you know, it's hard because, how do I put it? How do I put it?

[46:48] **qx()**: You know, this is something totally new and totally like, even though it's new, it's still, and we have a lot of adoption in the meme space and the speculation space.
[47:03] **qx()**: Ergo is even kind of still true and new to that.
[47:08] **qx()**: So here we are kind of swimming against currents of these things that degrade what cryptography is and degrade what actual these decentralized and peer-to-peer financial tools are.
[47:22] **qx()**: And we're fighting against that all the time.

[47:26] **qx()**: I don't know how many times I've been somewhere and somebody will say something like, oh, somebody got scammed on crypto or look at this scammy crypto.
[47:34] **qx()**: When they look at me, I'm like, That's not what I do.
[47:37] **qx()**: You know what I do is totally different than these other kind of things that you're hearing about.

[47:44] **qx()**: So then I think about like how hard it is to start these kind of new revolutions.
[47:51] **qx()**: We're bucking against a system that's been in place for a long time by very powerful forces.
[48:01] **qx()**: So here we are trying to come up with and promote and encourage actual value that is owned by people themselves, as opposed to being at the will of people who have more power and money than you.
[48:16] **qx()**: So that's going to be another current that we're hitting as well.

[48:18] **qx()**: So I'm grateful that I can experience that and we can experience that all of us as part of Ergo right now in this timeline, right?
[48:27] **qx()**: So this is, this is a hard part. This is like the fight. This is the struggle where, you know, you see in the past people give up and that's it.
[48:39] **qx()**: And then some things never, you know, keeps going.

[48:42] **qx()**: That's where we're at. I feel in Ergo because we're fighting against the general idea that we need safety, we need some bank to hold our funds and be responsible for them for us.
[48:54] **qx()**: We're fighting against a current of crap tokens and meme projects that are just extracting value and scams.
[49:01] **qx()**: So it's not easy.

[49:04] **qx()**: But at the same time, I'm grateful that we're here to experience that because it just strengthens my resolve that this kind of stuff is what's important and what we need.

[49:19] **qx()**: All right, let's see. Oh, HQx messed up, kushti.
[49:26] **qx()**: He's 61 entries.
[49:30] **qx()**: So we have to take 61 and divide it by two.
[49:32] **qx()**: So 30 and a half.
[49:33] **qx()**: Why don't you go from 30 and a half to 61 and I'll go from one to 30 and a half.
[49:39] **qx()**: I'm going to take 27 is my number.

[49:45] **kushti**: Oh, but mine is still the same.

[49:47] **qx()**: So you'll stay at 48. Okay.

[49:52] **qx()**: Okay. So 27 and 48. There you go. HQx. We've done it legitimately.

[49:57] **qx()**: So we have the NFT wizard, new to the channel has a few questions. What's the high level mission statement of Ergo?

[50:10] **qx()**: You want to take that question?

[50:15] **kushti**: High-level mission statement of Ergo. So, yeah, well, there is Ergo Manifesto, right, about that in particular, and we are doing Ergo Book to include more materials, like Grassroots Manifesto, which is not so-so known, right, by Joe.

[50:41] **kushti**: So I think in very short, the idea here is to provide grassroots-based counter-cyclical tools in the form of peer-to-peer digital free banking.
[51:05] **kushti**: which means a lot of things when you are going to unwrap it, such as unsensorable nature of interactions, right?
[51:16] **kushti**: And then, yeah, well, you need to have features which usually only banks have, you know, even more.

[51:30] **kushti**: You have your, well, passing money emission rights to these peer-to-peer free bankings.
[51:43] **kushti**: So not commercial banks we have now, which are emitting most of money and so on.
[51:51] **kushti**: Then it means new principles of emission and so on.
[51:54] **kushti**: So yeah, like hundreds of different things, but yeah, in very short, well, the mission is like that.

[52:08] **qx()**: Well, to me, I guess.

[52:09] **kushti**: So what about you?

[52:11] **qx()**: To me? Yeah, I would say a lot of that, a lot of what Ergo's high level mission to me is what I just spoke about earlier in my rant about five minutes ago.

[52:23] **qx()**: I think I think humanity at least has gone through a period of uneducation, right?
[52:31] **qx()**: The removal of self-custody and the removal of the importance of that.
[52:36] **qx()**: They've traded comfort or power over themselves and their own entities, right?

[52:44] **qx()**: So, like I said, they've traded the ability to know that if they screw up or if they put their credit card number on a wrong site, they can call their bank and say, this was a fraud, and that kind of thing, and get it pulled back.
[53:00] **qx()**: So there's comfort in that, right?
[53:02] **qx()**: I think the opposite should be true.
[53:06] **qx()**: I think we need to re-educate, and it's a slow, long road.
[53:09] **qx()**: And I think there goes a position to do that, as well as perhaps some other projects.

[53:14] **qx()**: re-educate that you're in control of your funds on a network that I can trade and create value for with everybody else in the world, right?
[53:28] **qx()**: So that means if I screw up, I screw up.
[53:32] **qx()**: And it's a hard lesson to learn, right?
[53:34] **qx()**: But it's gonna be a lot of that early on, I think.
[53:38] **qx()**: So I think Ergo facilitates that.
[53:40] **qx()**: Ergo facilitates and puts the power back into the people's hands.

[53:44] **qx()**: It allows somebody like myself to run a Rosen Bridge watcher and verify on chain that funds are being transferred in a certain method and release those funds to other people, essentially.
[53:59] **qx()**: It allows me to go on to a decentralized peer-to-peer website like SigmaFi.
[54:05] **qx()**: and loan somebody, you know, a thousand SigmaUSD.
[54:10] **qx()**: or going to DuckPools and dump my SigmaUSD into the DuckPools pool to earn interest on it that nobody can really stop because it's a smart contract.
[54:20] **qx()**: So those kind of things are super invaluable to me and Ergo facilitates that 100%.

[54:27] **qx()**: It puts the power of finance back into the people's hands that's been intentionally de-educated, uneducated, this is a word I'm thinking of but I can't think of it, over the years, intentionally to keep people in control, in control and continuing to make money off that.

[54:50] **qx()**: Like I just saw the other day, yesterday, right?
[54:53] **qx()**: I saw the other day that a bank right a bank that already makes interest off the money that you put into it right so you put money into a bank they invest your money lend it out correct so a bank is just had an announcement the other day that a lot of banks do this of course with with their pro checking accounts but typically they have a free level of checking account but they're removing their free level of checking account and making it so that you had to either direct deposit into the account

[55:22] **qx()**: or you had to carry a balance over like a thousand dollars or they charge you a certain amount for a month like that is insane like this is exactly why self-custody is important right where they're already making money off the money that we put in there and now they're just pulling more and extracting more value out of the money that you've earned that you've put in there so

[55:45] **qx()**: Hopefully, crypto will change that.
[55:47] **qx()**: Hopefully, Ergo will be part of that, the drive there.
[55:51] **qx()**: It certainly has positioned itself to do so.
[55:54] **qx()**: And it's proven itself over the last four or five years that it's resilient.
[56:00] **qx()**: And it doesn't matter about market conditions on the outside or perception of crypto as a whole.
[56:08] **qx()**: That's what Ergo does.
[56:09] **qx()**: So that's my rant, kushti.

[56:15] **kushti**: All right.

[56:19] **qx()**: I think, I think we've hit all the questions. well, is Keystone integrated. Do you have an update on Keystone? Do we know?

[56:28] **qx()**: Is that C8 that's working on Keystone?

[56:31] **kushti**: Yeah, there's, there's updates one week. Oh, fine. It's, but well, it's, it's still as far as I know. recently,

[56:47] **kushti**: Well, it's with deterministic signatures solved for the consistent environment.
[56:56] **kushti**: And then, yeah, Keystone. So, latest update. Making good progress with the Keystone integration.
[57:05] **kushti**: SDK part is mostly 10 PR is opened against the case.
[57:14] **kushti**: Still being in the final push of displaying transactions, signing data and testing.
[57:24] **kushti**: Pull request can mount here. Some link, but is not updated for the latest changes.
[57:31] **kushti**: So yeah, it's still quite well.

[57:38] **qx()**: Did you see the nice, the nice design on Twitter the other day with the Ergo logo across the back of the Keystone?
[57:44] **qx()**: That was pretty nice looking.

[57:48] **kushti**: Yeah. Yeah. And the view is selling, I believe, Keystone pieces with something like that are going to, do you know what's going on?

[58:02] **qx()**: I don't know. I think it was just a promotion. I don't think it's live yet, right?
[58:07] **qx()**: I'll buy one as soon as it is.

[58:08] **kushti**: Oh, so, yeah. It's all right. Yeah. All right.

[58:18] **qx()**: Well, 10 o'clock, I got another meeting to run to kushti. I think your mic's starting to finally break up a little bit.
[58:23] **qx()**: So I think it's a good time to end it for the new year right on time.

[58:30] **qx()**: All right. Bye guys. Thanks everybody for joining. Ciao.

[58:35] **kushti**: Bye guys.
