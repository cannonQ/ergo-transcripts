# Ergo PoW Blockchain - Weekly Update & AMA - February 12th, 2025

## Executive Summary

This community call covered significant developments in the Ergo ecosystem, particularly around the Rosen Bridge progress and upcoming multi-chain initiatives. Dan Friedman from Palmyra provided updates on their token launch planned for later February, which will utilize Rosen Bridge for multi-chain deployment across Cardano, Ergo, and EVM networks. The team discussed strategic decisions around centralized exchange listings, emphasizing deep liquidity over broad distribution to ensure stable trading conditions.

Technical updates included progress on Ergo 6.0 RC2 testing, with improved testnet performance and ongoing sub-blocks development. The conversation also touched on the evolving US regulatory landscape for cryptocurrency and the importance of decentralized infrastructure. Community discussions highlighted the distinction between utility-focused marketing versus speculation-driven promotion, with emphasis on building practical applications that don't require users to understand the underlying blockchain technology.

## Notable Quotes

**Dan Friedman (Palmyra)**: "I can't afford that like, you know for one of my main jobs is to minimize risk, you know to minimize the risk... I can't have that. I can't have that. That's irresponsible for me to do and for the people that are in my ecosystem."

**Dan Friedman (qx)**: "Something like Ergo exists outside of these walls, right?... Ergo can survive in a state of privacy because it's optional. We're deregulated, essentially decentralized, because anybody can run a node in any country with just a small computer."

**Dan Friedman (Palmyra)**: "The UL provides a very, very needed and robust function that other products can be built on or built against or be benchmarked against... I really think that it should be up to the project. You know, the project, individual projects building on Ergo should be out there promoting and talking to the non-crypto people."
