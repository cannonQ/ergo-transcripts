      "question": "What makes Ergo's Autolykos algorithm special for mining?",
      "asker": "Marc the Shark",
      "answer": "Autolykos is ASIC resistant, memory hard, and very GPU friendly. It runs cooler on GPUs compared to other algorithms, making it easier on the cards. ASIC companies aren't going to come into Ergo and rug miners because the algorithm prevents ASICs from being effective.",

      "question": "How does Ergo's emission schedule work and when does it change?",
      "asker": "Marc the Shark",
      "answer": "Ergo's emission reduces every three months by 3 ERG. Currently at 12 ERG per block, it will go to 9, then 6, then 3 ERG forever. Block time remains static at 2 minutes. This decreasing supply creates scarcity as fewer ERG are emitted daily into the ecosystem.",

      "answer": "Calculate your daily ERG mined using: (hash rate / network hash) \u00d7 block reward \u00d7 blocks per day. Then divide your daily electrical cost by daily ERG mined. If it costs $1.50 to mine ERG but ERG is worth $0.60, you're at a loss. If ERG is $2, you're making 100% profit.",

      "asker": "Marc the Shark",
      "answer": "Autolykos uses memory intensive mining where the GPU core sits relatively idle but focuses on VRAM. Minimum requirement is 6 gigabytes of VRAM, with 8+ gigabytes being optimal. You should underclock the GPU, overclock the memory, and reduce voltage for efficiency.",

      "asker": "Marc the Shark",
      "answer": "Mining creates virgin coins in a virgin wallet - it's literally only ERG coming in that's mined. Nobody knows where you're at except the mining pool, and there are no other transactions tied to that wallet. It's a very anonymous way to dollar cost average into ERG without anyone being able to tie it to you.",

      "asker": "Marc the Shark",
      "answer": "Ergo maintains ASIC resistance through dynamic protection with scheduled memory increases that brick any ASIC attempts. This keeps mining power distributed globally with individual miners, ensures fair competition where GPUs compete on equal footing, and maintains true decentralization rather than centralized ASIC farms.",

      "asker": "Marc the Shark",
      "answer": "PPLNS creates a window of recent shares - for Sigmonauts it's 0.5x difficulty, roughly 12 hours. When you start mining, you have no shares in that window so you're penalized initially. After 12 hours you reach maximum participation. If you turn off your miners, you lose shares from that window proportionally based on downtime.",

      "answer": "Storage rent is Ergo's unique feature that collects fees from unspent boxes older than four years. It prevents blockchain bloat and provides additional revenue for miners. Sigmonauts mining pool distributes this proportionally to miners based on their participation, effectively increasing earnings beyond block rewards.",

The pool has 10,000 ERG in treasury, variable fees that can be voted on (currently 1%), and all major decisions are voted on by the community. Any miner can get a DAO token to participate in governance.",

      "asker": "Marc the Shark",
      "answer": "Each GPU generates 100-200 watts of heat, so 6 GPUs produce 1200 watts equivalent to a space heater. Key solutions include proper room positioning away from walls, understanding heat transfer principles, basement mining (warm air rises), garage ventilation, and in hot climates, AC costs can kill profits so consider mining during cooler night hours.",
