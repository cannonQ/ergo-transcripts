# Community Call Summary: A Better Proof of Work Fork Choice Rule

**Call Date:** July 1, 2024  
**Presenter:** Dionysis Zindros (Common Prefix)  
**Event:** Ergoversary Summit 2024

## Executive Summary

Dionysis Zindros presented groundbreaking research on POEM (Proofs of Entropy Minima), a novel proof-of-work fork choice rule that could significantly improve blockchain performance. Unlike traditional proof-of-work systems that score blocks based on their nominal difficulty targets, POEM scores blocks based on their actual achieved hash values - essentially counting the number of leading zeros in each block's hash. This approach allows the protocol to better utilize "wasted" proof-of-work that occurs when multiple honest miners produce blocks simultaneously, particularly in fast blockchain configurations.

The research demonstrates that POEM can provide approximately 50% performance improvements over traditional longest-chain rules while maintaining the same level of security against adversarial attacks. Importantly, this improvement is composable with other blockchain optimization techniques, making it a valuable upgrade that can be combined with existing scaling solutions without requiring fundamental architectural changes.

## Key Discussion Points

• **POEM Protocol Mechanics**: Introduction of a new scoring function that uses -log₂(hash) instead of traditional block counting, effectively measuring the "fatness" of blocks based on achieved hash difficulty

• **Mathematical Foundation**: The protocol leverages exponential distributions and connects discrete hash values to continuous mathematical tools like gamma distributions and Poisson processes

• **Performance Advantages**: POEM provides better adversary resistance in fast blockchain configurations where multiple blocks are mined simultaneously by honest parties

• **Composability**: Unlike other blockchain optimization techniques, POEM can be combined with existing scaling solutions like parallel chains and Prism without conflicts

• **Real-world Application**: The fork choice rule change could be applied to existing proof-of-work systems including Bitcoin, Ergo, and others without major protocol overhauls

• **Research Status**: The work is currently available as a preprint on ePrint and represents ongoing research not yet published at an official conference

## Decisions Made

No specific implementation decisions were made during this presentation, as this was a research presentation rather than a governance or development planning call. The presenter indicated this is ongoing research work with potential future applications.

## Notable Quotes

> "The idea here is that we will leverage some of the constructions from NIPoPoWs, which Ergo already leverages. And remember these NIPoPoWs, what we do is we look at the actual hash of a block instead of its target." - **Dionysis Zindros**

> "If we are able to get this 50% faster by following the simple change here, that's quite a bit of an achievement because we can compose it with every other system. It's not like we have to make a choice." - **Dionysis Zindros**

> "POEM changes just the scoring algorithm... It changes this fork choice rule. So this advantage in making proof of work able to run faster while withstanding the same adversarial resilience can be composed with all these other systems." - **Dionysis Zindros**
