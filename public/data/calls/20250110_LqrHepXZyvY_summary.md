# Ergo Blockchain Community Call Summary

**Call Date:** January 10, 2025  
**Call Title:** Ergo PoW Blockchain - Weekly Update & AMA - January 9th 2025

## Executive Summary

This community call marked Dan Friedman's return to the regular AMAs after the holiday break, joined by kushti for updates on both Ergo ecosystem developments and Lithos Protocol's lithium-focused initiatives. The discussion covered significant protocol updates including the recent block reward reduction to 18 ERG, ongoing Node v6.0 security audits, and various ecosystem developments including wallet integrations and bridge testing. A major focus was Dan's announcement of a new decentralized lithium pricing index project that will utilize Ergo's oracle infrastructure, representing a significant real-world application that addresses fragmentation and price manipulation issues in the lithium commodity market.

The call also addressed community concerns about marketing efforts, with both speakers emphasizing the need for stronger, more unified messaging while acknowledging Ergo's versatility as both a strength and messaging challenge. Dan announced that Palm Token's TGE (Token Generation Event) is imminent, with dates to be announced within hours of the call.

## Notable Quotes

**kushti on decentralization**: "Decentralization is not about, like centralized team consisting of devs cable connected with, I don't know, VCs, maybe even producer talking about decentralization. But yeah, well, it's about many players, right?"

**Dan Friedman on Ergo's positioning**: "Bitcoin is digital gold. Ergo is digital clay. That's what it is to me. You can, it's ready to create and mold so many different things and you can make it in so many different shapes and things that to me is digital clay."

**kushti on marketing**: "What I'm thinking about is how to get 10x developers right in 2025 for core and ecosystem development. That would be much more solid right so talking about well recognition and so on."
