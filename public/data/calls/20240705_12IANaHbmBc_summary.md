# Ergo Blockchain Community Call Summary
**Date:** July 5, 2024  
**Title:** Weekly Update & AMA - July 4th 2024

## Executive Summary

This community call celebrated Ergo's fifth anniversary ("Ergoversary") with mgPai joining remotely from Japan where he's working with Dan on ZenGate technology. The discussion covered mgPai's experience at the Alephium developer conference in Greece, ZenGate's integration with Chainlink oracles, and the Winter Protocol for commodity traceability. Key themes included the importance of cross-chain interoperability over blockchain tribalism, especially among proof-of-work chains, and Ergo's unique position as a community-driven blockchain without major venture capital backing.

The call highlighted ongoing fifth anniversary content releases throughout the week, upcoming merchandise initiatives through the Sigmanauts, and discussions about Rosen Bridge expansion plans. Participants emphasized Ergo's authentic developer community that builds out of genuine interest rather than corporate funding, contrasting this with more heavily funded competing blockchains.

## Notable Quotes

**mgPai:** "We got to be focused on what the real goal is, right? The goal is to be separate from these centralized institutions that are inherently corrupted by the government or like human nature. That's a real goal."

**mgPai:** "I think the most impressive thing Ergo has is its developer community. Given the price movement and size and market cap and users on Ergo, it's very impressive how much developers we have on Ergo. These developers, they really don't have funding. It's all done out of interest."

**qx():** "We really shouldn't be fighting each other. We're not at that stage yet... when we're still fighting the same main goal together to bring about adoption of these decentralized and peer-to-peer networks, I really think we need to take it easy on how hard we shit talk or go hard against some of the people that are working hard like us."
