[00:12] **qx()**: Hello, and welcome to the live edition dev update, Ergoversary edition.

[00:20] **qx()**: And with me today, Marc the Shark.

[00:24] **qx()**: How are you doing, Marc the Shark?

[00:26] **Marc the Shark**: Yeah, pretty good. Trying to stay cool out here in Colorado. It's warming up in the summertime, so.

[00:32] **qx()**: What's the temperature right now in freedom units?

[00:35] **Marc the Shark**: Shoot, I don't know. I couldn't tell you off the top of my head. It's probably, here, one second. I was like, where are all my apps? And catch me on the spot.

[00:48] **Marc the Shark**: 70 degrees. So it's not too bad. But my boiler, tankless boiler, is in the room next door.

[00:54] **qx()**: Oh, that's a little toasty, huh?

[00:56] **Marc the Shark**: Yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely.

[00:58] **qx()**: You're like, honey, why do you have to take three showers a day? Come on.

[01:02] **Marc the Shark**: Right. And I already run hot, too. So it's just like, oh, jeez.

[01:06] **qx()**: Oh, gosh. We just had to get a new boiler in our house. What a pain in the ass. Oh, goodness gracious.

[01:12] **Marc the Shark**: Yeah, so how are you doing qx()? Rocking and rolling?

[01:14] **qx()**: Rocking and rolling, hanging in there happy, all pumped up because of Ergoversary today. Ergo is five years old. Isn't that crazy?

[01:23] **Marc the Shark**: Yeah, that's wild. Are you going to sing Happy Birthday to Ergo for us? We can wait maybe and let you know.

[01:29] **qx()**: Do I have my guitar? Let me see what I have. I've got a ukulele. Oh, dude. I don't want to have to get up. My guitar's way over there. Oh, you got one too?

[01:42] **Marc the Shark**: Hell yeah.

[01:48] **Marc the Shark**: Cool.

[01:48] **qx()**: Hang on. Let me see what I got. One sec. Don't move.

[01:54] **Marc the Shark**: Cool. Cool. While he's hanging out, we'll just jam.

[02:11] **qx()**: What are we keying, sir?

[02:23] **qx()**: We just took a turn for the worse.

[02:25] **Marc the Shark**: Hey, I like it though. We gotta put a little riff together.

[02:31] **qx()**: We should. It's gotta be hard over the internet though.

[02:35] **qx()**: All right, let's get back on track Ergoversary. That was our edition of happy birthday Somewhere over the rainbow kind of mixture. Perfect What was it gonna say so Ergoversary what's that mean to you Mark as a somebody who's kind of new to the Ergo ecosystem Well socially right you've been poking around for quite a while, but just decided recently to pop your head in What's what's that mean to you, sir?

[03:00] **Marc the Shark**: Yeah, so I guess, you know, five years, five years old, so that's pretty sweet. I guess to me, it's kind of just to kind of, I don't know, it's kind of tough, I suppose, just in the sense like, since I am new to the scene socially, been around, you know, been around since 21, but it's crazy to see all the growth, you know, so you're up here, it's really nice to see just the,

[03:29] **Marc the Shark**: from where we were in 2021, you know, we were in Yoroi.

[03:33] **qx()**: Now we got... Oh, you're right, right?

[03:36] **Marc the Shark**: Yeah, exactly.

[03:37] **qx()**: Did you say that you can tell, you know, that's a good litmus test to see how old an Ergo user is just in the room say, Yoroi, and you'll tell the Ergo user it's been around for a couple years and just go... Yeah, right, exactly.

[03:52] **Marc the Shark**: So it's like we've come a long ways, you know what I mean? We've, and, you know, hopefully, right, some ideas in terms of how to live life is like 1% better every day. And so I'd say we're approaching some exponential growth, especially with respect to those shitty wallets that we used to have. Nautilus is just so much better. And especially all the cool stuff it does, especially the NSFW sort of filters.

[04:16] **qx()**: The scam token filter, yeah, right.

[04:18] **Marc the Shark**: Yeah, the thing that Rustin helped facilitate. So you guys aren't blasting us with these BRICK tokens.

[04:28] **qx()**: I think I think CannonQ really pushed for that. I think he's got some wallets for his kids and yeah. Oh God, I did not want that stuff in my kids wallet. So it's nice with with Captain Nemo having to do the rewrite for Google to stay on the store, the Chrome store. He was

[04:45] **qx()**: I think he felt bad that I was testing the abyss browser and he's like, okay, we can implement it real quick. So he did. I think he did it within like eight hours. He implemented the two toggle switches and that it would check out the repository, the I forget YAML file on GitHub. And anybody who wants to add to that a scam token, I know somebody was looking to add Neta to it. So you can just go to the GitHub and you can do a pull request for it.

[05:18] **qx()**: For those of you who aren't familiar with GitHub, all you have to do is go to the repository, make an account, and you hit that fork button on the upper side. You edit the file yourself, and then you'll see a pull request right there. You hit add a comment, and then Rustin gets notified, and he can activate it. And I think it's pretty instant, because I think every time you open up Nautilus or it loads, it checks that list for you. It's pretty good. I think it's a good tool to have to help with newcomers who maybe aren't in tune, but you know, once scam tokens start being prevalent and of course the BRICK images and that has incorporation.

[05:59] **Marc the Shark**: Yeah. And it's funny you brought up another cause it's like, I would say that's even the sign of the times too, relative to when you got integrated into the ecosystem. Cause I remember when Neta first started and was like, Oh sick, this is going to be really cool. You know, bought a bunch of the NFTs and everything. And then now obviously knowing where it's at now. So it's really cool. It's obviously, you know, we've had these bumps along the way, so to speak.

[06:25] **Marc the Shark**: And then now I think, especially with Rosen Bridge really kind of like shining a light to where they were. Ergo could go just from like an interoperability perspective. But then, of course, like the whole ethos of everybody, you know, permissionless and, you know, really for like for everybody versus like even today on the future of proof of work, you know, with kind of talking the difference between proof of stake and proof of work coins.

[06:49] **qx()**: That was a good that was a good that was a good spaces, wasn't it?

[06:52] **Marc the Shark**: Yeah, absolutely. And like my big takeaway was just like proof of stake. It's like it's very permission based. And I never really thought about that. You know what I mean? It's very, you have to own the token, you gotta buy at a certain price. And I guess you could say it could be said with a GPU, depending on the bull market and where you're at, you might buy a GPU. It's more expensive than not, but it was an interesting sort of paradigm I didn't really think about.

[07:17] **qx()**: Yeah, but in proof of work gives you the ability gives anybody the ability to enter the ecosystem on their own terms at their own rate, you know, so if you have a ton of money, or you have the resources to buy GPUs in mind and support the network that way, then that's great. Or if you have an old gaming rig that you're just kicking around, and you just fire it up and want to put like I have a

[07:40] **qx()**: 3090 in the basement that I just fire away with that because I game on something else. So that gives you the freedom of choice. You don't have to ask any permission to it. I could, although I wouldn't want to, I could solo mine if I want to. I can set up my own node and stratum and mine myself and maybe in a year on 300 mega hash, I'd hit a block.

[08:01] **qx()**: But you know, that's something I can do and I don't have to go find an exchange to buy something at. I don't have to make sure I'm KYC'd in to get something. It's just the pure, I guess, freedom of availability there that proof of work does.

[08:17] **qx()**: FC CannonQ in the chat said POS is security, life bought to blockchains, he says. So, yeah, I get it. Yeah, yeah.

[08:29] **qx()**: But yeah, so those kind of things are neat that it was nice to hear. I guess like-minded individuals talking about it, the Nervos people, the Alephium people, and kushti, of course, all kind of talking about the same kind of thing. And the overall thing that I got from that is that these systems are building slowly over time for like an unbreakable, I mean, they're building, as Joe says, they're building for war, you know, and that's, it's nice to hear that and hear that echo through these people too.

[09:02] **qx()**: that are proof of work chains as opposed to, oh, let's spin something up and, you know, who holds the tokens and put them somewhere and then people can buy them and that's how they're in. I'm not dissing proof of stake, but it's, you know, it's, it's a different beast and it facilitates different things. So,

[09:19] **Marc the Shark**: You know, a lot of it, I think, too, is like they're flying up the seat of their pants. It's kind of it seems like it's very just like a cash grab almost. You know, it's like, let's just we have this idea. Let's just run with it. Not all of them are like that. Right. But I suppose like it seems like Cardano, for example, they really took the approach. They really have all the research papers, so to speak.

[09:39] **Marc the Shark**: But like something like Solana, you know what I mean? I don't know. It seems like there's a table, just like a money grab and just trying to, you know, not really thinking about it versus even that's where it's kind of weird when some people say, well, proof of work is just so old. It's like, well, there were a lot of different paradigms within society doesn't mean we should throw them away because they're old. If anything, we should embrace them, fix the things. There might be a specific pillar on this specific structure that could be maybe helped, but right.

[10:08] **qx()**: How old is the Fiat system? I get asked this.

[10:12] **Marc the Shark**: Exactly. That's like, if we think about it, that's got to be like, I mean, over a thousand years old, probably even more than that because, you know, gold is, when did we first like, I don't know, everybody was obsessed with gold all the way to ancient times.

[10:28] **qx()**: FC says, show me which proof of stake chain didn't do a pre-sale. He said, it'll wait patiently.

[10:38] **qx()**: I think it serves a purpose for what it's doing there. But I'm a proof of work guy. So it's really hard to convince me otherwise at this point in my life.

[10:52] **qx()**: And did you see any of the videos today on YouTube? Have you watched those yet?

[10:58] **Marc the Shark**: I watched the first one with kushti. I think it was like ErgoTrees or no, Sigma trees. That was like super early in the morning. My little one decided to wake up at 5 a.m. so.

[11:13] **Marc the Shark**: How about you?

[11:14] **qx()**: Yeah, I watched some of that. And then I jumped over to the Stanford guy talking about how they could utilize these blocks, essentially. So the way the blockchain works is you have, oh, you can tell I worked on my car this weekend. The way the blockchain works is you have people inputting transactions into the blocks, and so you could have one chain here, one chain here, one chain here.

[11:43] **qx()**: This chain kind of finishes first, it's longer, or this finger's longer, I guess. So these other two chains are gone, and this is the only chain that's, this is a true chain, alright? And then it builds from there, the next one goes from there. So that's how it works. So in his video, from what I understand, the brief parts that I watched, is there's a way to not waste this effort from the other chains that are being built that didn't make it in time or weren't the longest chain. So it was an interesting idea that they're working on there.

[12:14] **Marc the Shark**: What would be the application, I suppose, with that?

[12:18] **qx()**: I guess I should rewatch it. I didn't catch that part. I was trying to work on a computer at work and watching at the same time. But you should watch it. It was a pretty interesting video. And then I think there's another surprise one tomorrow from somebody off chain.

[12:39] **qx()**: Let me actually see. I'm not going to tell you who they are because I think they're keeping them secret, right? I can at least hint to it. Let me go to content here.

[12:51] **Marc the Shark**: Which brings us to a nice little segue if you do want to get involved with the Ergo community and a community-based decentralized autonomous organization, the Sigmanauts.

[13:04] **Marc the Shark**: always accepting numbers. And we do have privy, which we are privy to the events that will be taking place over the next couple of days, so.

[13:11] **qx()**: Yes, yes, yes. So tomorrow there's, let's see, yeah, a better proof of work fork choice was what I watched today for the Stanford guy. I believe, oh, we've got a special one. I can tell you got a special one from Dan the man coming up. Tomorrow our Trade House was pretty cool. It's a really short one. It gives you a quite a quite a quick overview of Trade House We got Bruno coming up to tomorrow from Gluon and there's a Neat thing that we've heard kushti talk about briefly in the AMAs and there's gonna be a presentation about that tomorrow The guy's first name is Lucas.

[13:52] **qx()**: So maybe you guys can look that up and figure out what that is and. We've got the Sigmanauts, kind of history of Sigmanauts, chat up. That's myself. That's Mark Glasgow and Noah. And when we did that, I was like, okay, let's get Noah, who was there at the very beginning, and let's get Mark, who's been there all the way through, and myself, who came middle until now kind of thing. So it's a kind of a good like, hey, how was it back when you were there? And what made you make these decisions? So that was a fun talk. a lot of laughing, and Andy put a really shitty thumbnail of myself laughing. Everybody else was kind of serious, and I'm like...

[14:30] **qx()**: Thanks, Andy. I really appreciate it.

[14:33] **qx()**: But there's a good array of videos tomorrow, and also the spaces that's coming up, where we invited all the dApps and the projects up to talk at 4 p.m. UTC, so that'll be a lot of fun.

[14:47] **Marc the Shark**: Perfect.

[14:48] **qx()**: Are you going to come to the spaces, Mark? Are you free?

[14:50] **Marc the Shark**: Yeah, I should be free. I just need to check, I guess, what the UTC is relative to my time. But generally, schedule's pretty open.

[14:59] **Marc the Shark**: Perfect. Should be there.

[15:02] **qx()**: OK, let's see. You wanted to chat a little bit about the proposal you just put up on Paideia. Why don't you do that while I start scrolling through this damn dev update?

[15:13] **Marc the Shark**: Okay, perfect. Sweet. So if you guys don't know, Paideia is a framework built on the blockchain. And so basically allows us to vote the Sigmanauts work, we're testing it out beta testing it. And so when, when I first I guess got on boarded, I was kind of suggesting the idea of making a mining pool with the DAO. So

[15:39] **Marc the Shark**: because it constantly sort of in the mining space and crypto space in general, you know, miners are always worried about money relative to mining. And I totally get that it's a business, but also at the same time, I think it's also coming up to us to build tools for miners. And so for example, if you think about Ethereum, they kind of just said, forget miners, so to speak, for whatever reasons.

[16:03] **Marc the Shark**: And so it's important for us to have a say. And so where that. is setting up DAO. And so specifically for our mining pool, it would be great if we could have that. And so we could say, hey, we want to do XYZ with these funds. We want to vote on the pool's percentage fee. We want to do whatever. We want to pay some guy to do X, go to some event. Whatever. So essentially right now, the pool is run by myself and qx(), but I guess it's under the main umbrellas, the Sigmanauts.

[16:37] **Marc the Shark**: And so this proposal is to facilitate, I guess the branching and kind of creating like an ecosystem, I suppose it could be called for Sigmanauts. So Sigmanauts ecosystem, and then within that ecosystem, we potentially would have each respective organizations

[16:56] **Marc the Shark**: And so a lot of this is sort of up in the air and how this is going to work. And so I created a proposal on Paideia. And so to quote qx() here, the intent is that the pool is to run and controlled by miners. The whole idea is to empower the miners and teach them that they can control Ergo.

[17:13] **Marc the Shark**: and so that's what we're going to do and so just trying to create discussion in terms of how we should do that. What should our mission statement be? What should the Sigmanauts mission statement be? Should it be simply they will support the Sigmanauts ecosystem which currently includes the Sigmanauts mining pooled out? Should there be other stuff? What do you guys think? It certainly shouldn't just be what I think, right?

[17:39] **qx()**: This is community discussion. Paideia allows community discussion too. Anybody can come and comment without a wallet, right? Do you even need a wallet to comment on these proposals?

[17:49] **Marc the Shark**: I think you do need a wallet, but you don't need a token.

[17:51] **qx()**: You don't need a DAO token for that specific.

[17:53] **Marc the Shark**: Yeah. Because it does say like, specific people in terms of the address, commented and stuff.

[18:01] **qx()**: And I hope Sahar and Raro aren't watching this. There goes all of Paideia.

[18:08] **Marc the Shark**: So yes, let us know. Let me know what you guys think. Kind of testing out this sort of, I guess, prototype of democracy relative to the mining pool. And so another thing is traditionally mining pools are

[18:25] **Marc the Shark**: You know, for profit, obviously, right? But they're trying to make money. They're running across with multiple different points. Well, this pool is only on Ergo right now. So we're for Ergo, by Ergo. And so we're really just supporting the community, supporting the ecosystem. And so come help us, come join us, give us your hash rate or send us your hash rate. We're doing some pretty cool things that other pools aren't doing. And so you can help us shape what that democracy may or may not look like.

[18:54] **qx()**: And I said for a while now, and I'll say it again, I don't think the Sigmanauts should be the only community group. That's going to be like, what's the point of it? It's just going to be another foundation.

[19:07] **qx()**: So these kind of things where there's opportunities for groups to splinter off but still be kind of part of the Sigmanauts and still uphold the mission statement of the Sigmanauts and the purpose of the Sigmanauts. as well as be potentially a revenue source for themselves and the Sigmanauts. I think those can live in harmony and be better overall. The last thing you want is like a mining group that's kind of crippled in what they can do because they have to roll it back up to the Sigmanauts and ask questions and then get it voted on their Paideia before it comes back down and gets

[19:40] **qx()**: That's kind of a bureaucracy that's going to murder us all. So this kind of thing will make it a little more autonomous to where the mining pool can kind of operate on its own with still a responsibility to kind of help fundraise the Sigmanauts and uphold their values. So I think it's a win-win for everybody in that case.

[20:00] **Marc the Shark**: Yeah.

[20:01] **qx()**: I was showing it up on the screen while you were saying that. So people can see it.

[20:06] **Marc the Shark**: And so one thing we're actively problem-solving is how should we distribute tokens, DAO tokens, to the miners? So right now, if you're aware, me and qx() are in an alpha phase with this swap mechanism. And so we both, for example, have more than one mining wallet, essentially, right now. So if we were to do it per miner, we'd both get two tokens. That doesn't make any sense. We could do a snapshot. Again, maybe it doesn't make sense. We could distribute them, say, hey, raise your hand. I want a token. Verify they're in the pool. Fantastic. You get a token. But then how does it work in terms of they stay for a day, then they leave. And then now they have a DAO token. So again, it's very nuanced. It's very complicated. We need a lot of people's sort of opinions so we can kind of narrow on this solution.

[20:54] **Marc the Shark**: And this couldn't just be our. Our answers, I guess, you know, I think we have like 50 miners, so we should have like a decent amount of say and even to reiterate, like if somebody else wanted to spin off the realm of mining, you could use my mining UI.

[21:13] **Marc the Shark**: you know, you could reach out to us. We could probably give, you know, our config so you could set up your own mining pool.

[21:19] **qx()**: I've set my config to people already.

[21:21] **Marc the Shark**: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Totally. We should totally have more community mining pools. We need to get rid of this sort of like, I mean, granted, I think it's, you know, it's good to have these sort of big pools like DX pool, woolly pulley, but I think, you know, they're not actively developing as far as I know on the ecosystem. They're just sort of, you know,

[21:41] **Marc the Shark**: trying to make money either selling the coin right as you mine it. I mean, that's cool, I guess. Right.

[21:45] **qx()**: But at the end of the day, you can't rag on miners too much for cover. You know what I mean?

[21:51] **Marc the Shark**: But no, absolutely. Absolutely. But I think if we're in the ecosystem, reminding the coin, you know, it'd be great if you wanted to support something

[22:01] **Marc the Shark**: for the for the ecosystem. So maybe you can maybe boost your own bag, so to speak, if we're again talking about money here. So do something that supports that versus like you wouldn't want to.

[22:14] **Marc the Shark**: You know, from a US perspective, right, you're you're probably invested in a lot of companies that are in the US, probably not really

[22:22] **Marc the Shark**: invested in some companies, maybe outside of the US. Maybe, maybe not, right? This might be a stupid argument. But for the most part, like for me, for example, I'm invested into a lot of companies in the US. So I want the US I don't know, maybe. Now I'm kind of thinking about it. Maybe it doesn't make too much sense. But trying to come up with an analogy on the fly. But hopefully you guys get what I'm saying.

[22:46] **qx()**: I hear what you're saying, Mark. The cool thing about mining, too, is that regardless of price, you have a hash rate that fluctuates. But let's say you invest in some cards, all right? Until emission tails and the emissions goes down, for that period of time, no matter what the price does, you're mining the same coin as long as the hash rate is. You're mining the same amount. So the power that you've purchased from back in the day with whatever spending power you had there,

[23:13] **qx()**: Purchases the same coin each time regardless at the price goes to a dollar fifty or eighty nine cents so there's a benefit and a slip there as opposed to DCAing to is another you know method to do it of course, but then you're buying power of the dollar and

[23:30] **qx()**: might not be as much as it was worth back when you initially were going. And so there are variations and fluctuations there. I personally just like mining. I mean, I mine because I can set it. It's like my automated DCA kind of thing, even though it's a small amount. It does something. I get my Bitcoin, a Rosen Bitcoin right now for my wallet every couple of days. And that's good enough for me.

[24:00] **Marc the Shark**: Yeah, there you go. It's a yeah, it's definitely a really cool mechanism, and it really opens the door in terms of like just getting familiar with technology, you know, as well, especially just like, you know, if you want to learn Linux and run your stuff on Linux, it's a great, great way to learn and kind of open the doors in terms of that, you know, or whatever you're trying to do, put a spreadsheet together. It's a business. So it's a good

[24:26] **Marc the Shark**: It's a good, good lesson.

[24:27] **qx()**: I mean, that's the thing that I was surprised about too. I, I never thought of it that way, but I was talking to, I forget who it was, one of the miners and he's like showing me stuff and he's like, yeah, here's a spreadsheet I have. I'm like, holy shit. This guy's got like, it's legit. Like he's got everything calculated as energy costs. He can do a little tweak and boom, it changes all the numbers. So it's not just something that people willy nilly, you know, turn on and point this stuff to it's a thought out thing. And,

[24:55] **qx()**: people are mining Ergo, you know, right now, maybe not for the money, depending on where they live, but for speculation and to support the network. So it's, you know, it's, it's, it's, it's great. Great. We like the miners. We like miners.

[25:09] **Marc the Shark**: Exactly. And that's empowering. Let's educate them. you know, it's always great to learn, hopefully, right? So, and that's the whole point of the community based pools. And again, if you want to start your own, hit us up, happy to help you out. And plus, it'd be interesting if from like a community partnership level, if it was like, if we had different community pools that we could like work with, and like, how could that work? And so, you know, maybe,

[25:36] **Marc the Shark**: you know, we could like rent hashrate from them somehow. And then we get the reward or I don't know, you know, I mean, there's could be some nuances that that just aren't there because people aren't doing that yet. And so once that more chess pieces get added to the board, there are now more levels to be played. And then that could help other people in some different ways that no one's ever sort of thought about. So it's kind of interesting.

[25:59] **qx()**: I think it'd be neat to have a competing mining pool. I mean, you come to think about it, right? I don't think people realize that the less people in the mining pool, the less blocks you're going to hit, but the less blocks, but the more reward you're going to get divided amongst yourselves. So it all evens out in the end, correct? Over a certain threshold, it all evens out in the end. And we're sitting at a sweet spot 60, 70, 80, some 85 gigahash that produces on, you know, sometimes we'll get three blocks a day, sometimes like a couple days ago, we got one like 10, we hit a 10 blocks like three days ago. So we'll range in between those and, and it all evens out. So

[26:41] **qx()**: I mean, ideally, yeah, I think these couple hundred gigahash pools, it'd be really nice until Lithos comes at least to have these kind of subgroups around. So if anybody wants to, like Marc said, anybody wants to take our code and spin up a mining pool and go at it and garner some support and get some people pointing towards it. buy out, you know, all the power to you. That'd be, that'd be fantastic to have some, to be nice to, to have some competition in the, in the direct space. Right now, the only thing that motivates me is Marc being like, Hey, Andre, you got that, you got that shit done, you promise?

[27:22] **Marc the Shark**: No, it's all good. But yeah, it's like a little arms race, you know, we could have like some competition. That'd be so fun in some sense that, you know,

[27:31] **qx()**: Yeah, I mean, even like projects could do it on their own. I mean, Git Block was amazing back then, but nothing stopping like Mav from spinning up a Bober pool, where he gets 10, 20 giga hash from a couple people, from 10 people or 15 people. And he can start dropping Bober tokens as bonus straight. So you can have these kind of themed mining pools would be really neat.

[28:00] **Marc the Shark**: Right. And then we kind of sort of take on, I guess, some of the persona that like, I think Cardano does really well to where it's like becomes very marketing based with their sort of pools. And it's like, well, why would I join your pool? Like you're saying, it's like, oh, well, you can get bonus tokens of both of them. Oh, well, oh, you're going to do that. We're going to. create value over here. And so we're not just creating value and like the base token reminding we're creating value, I guess, within like the community members from like a human to human perspective. And then we're also adding value just in the tools to be able to like, oh, you're going to do that? Well, I'm going to make this mining spreadsheet. So from a tax purposes, you're more set up or we're oh, we're going to integrate with like Crystal Pools or you know, whatever the case, right.

[28:43] **qx()**: Yeah, when I went to Rare Evo last year, or not at Rare Evo, at CNF TECON, I came back with that exact same perspective because I met a lot of Cardano SPOs. SPOs, not ISPOs, SPOs. And I said, why can't we make running a mining core pool as sexy as SPO?

[29:05] **qx()**: I said, why can't we get like these people who are like big personalities that are like, come to my mining pool. It's really cool. We have Friday night hangouts, we have poker night on Sundays, you know, that kind of stuff, make it a community thing. And that's my hope eventually, you know, for that kind of stuff.

[29:22] **Marc the Shark**: So yeah, yeah, I think it's on I think, I think the wave is coming, you know, I think for sure, because I definitely want to push for that too. And I think it's all about empowering people to do that, just like, you know, in some sense, you've empowered me to

[29:36] **Marc the Shark**: kind of help and be where I'm at with respect to the pool, which has been pretty great. And I know there's some other folks within our Sigmanauts mining chat that have been super helpful and always want to learn things like that. So I think slowly but surely, keep doing what we're doing and eventually it'll stick, right? Build it, they will come, I think is a nice motto.

[29:59] **qx()**: So Marc, do you have your ticket for Rare Evo yet?

[30:03] **Marc the Shark**: You haven't sent it to me.

[30:05] **qx()**: No, I mean your plane ticket. Are you are you are you biking? Are you biking?

[30:09] **qx()**: Yeah, you're getting your solar car out and you're gonna start hitting three miles an hour.

[30:14] **Marc the Shark**: I'm actually I'm gonna I'm waiting for this weekend. I've got some personal news that may or may not change things where I'll be flying out at. And then once I have that figured out, but a friend of mine that I was able to swing with to come to the come to the event, he's already got our

[30:32] **Marc the Shark**: our hotel room, so we'll be staying in Trump Tower.

[30:37] **Marc the Shark**: Yeah, which is funny, because we got our hats. So we're making hats for the event. It's going to say, make mining great again.

[30:44] **qx()**: We'll have the Ergo logo on the back. They're going to be red with white print. It's going to look just like it. We're going to match the font. It's going to be great again. So we're going to put in a Paideia proposal for the Sigmanauts. I think 100 hats we're getting. Is that it?

[31:00] **Marc the Shark**: I think so, yeah.

[31:02] **qx()**: We might do something where we give away every five, so maybe we'll give away 20 hats in total. Either we do it randomly, like, oh, you're the fifth hat purchaser, here you go, kind of thing, so that we at least break even with that.

[31:21] **qx()**: Yeah, cool.

[31:23] **Marc the Shark**: And even though I want to put up, it'd be cool. I guess we should do it through the boat too. But I had this idea of it'd be sick if, if somebody wanted to pay through their hash rate for a specific amount of time. So it's like, you want to buy a hat? Well, you can mine the hat. And so, and then so we can keep track of whatever your hash rate is over some time. And then once that meets some agreed threshold, maybe we'll mention NFT and then. Of course get their details personally.

[31:49] **qx()**: We don't have to do a whole system, but it would be kind of cool We can do that pretty easily we can do Essentially we can do a hat pool and a hat just like we do BTC and Rosen for now I could make a hat wallet and people can mine to the hat wallet and just you know segment their thing like we do with the other things and then after a certain threshold it

[32:12] **qx()**: Yeah, we can't switch them off it. But on a certain threshold, we could send them an NFT to their wallet and say, hey, by the way, switch your miner switch your miner back to the normal pool because you've earned a hat.

[32:26] **Marc the Shark**: Yeah, that'd be so sick. Honestly.

[32:30] **qx()**: would be cool a hat and from merchandise and we're getting them from GreasyCex is the leader of GreasyCex has a kind of a gateway to apparel he's he that's what he does kind of in his real life so we're gonna quote for that and we'll put that up there hats sweatshirts all that kind of stuff so that should be I can't wait to buy my GreasyCex not my GreasyCex my own make

[32:56] **qx()**: make mining great again. You know, funny thing is, I had a red hat that had white writing on it once that I wore a couple years ago. And it's funny, you know, I live in a very, very liberal town, college town, big 20,000 kids just in school alone. So it's a very liberal college town. And walking through like Wegmans or that kind of thing, you should see these

[33:20] **qx()**: Very affluent like grayish, you know graying hair ladies that look like their hair is absolutely beautiful and silky just looking at me for a second It's a good way if you're not trying to get anybody to sit by you, you know Just put the hat on like I don't know if you watch the Curb Your Enthusiasm episode with that

[33:47] **Marc the Shark**: Yeah, basically he is like, he's sitting at like a sushi restaurant and he's got his hat down. Oh, you want to sit here? Sure. He puts the hat on. It's like, yeah, go ahead. Oh, no, no, no. Oh, boy.

[34:00] **qx()**: All right. What else did you want? There was one more thing you've met brought up that I told you I would definitely forget.

[34:04] **Marc the Shark**: Oh, geez. I think I did forget it. I'm trying to think real quick. Yeah, I guess it's not important.

[34:15] **qx()**: All right, maybe we'll come to it later. Cool, cool. Oh, I wanted to mention this right here. Let me go to this right here. Congratulations to Crystal Pools for winning first place. That's a self-custodial exchange, order book kind of thing. DuckPools got second place with the options trading platform. And Analog Ergo on the charts again. Two Ergo hacks in a row.

[34:43] **qx()**: with their Lightning Network integration for this. Super, super cool. Super, super glad to see that. And these are the votes from the, I believe, the Ergo Foundation who puts out the Ergo hack.

[34:58] **Marc the Shark**: Nice, nice. Yeah, I'm excited to see what everybody goes with it just because I think from the last couple, you know, generally new projects get stood up and new, you know, just new ecosystems sort of just attracts people. It's like, it's an on ramp to the ecosystem and

[35:14] **Marc the Shark**: I'm personally really excited for Crystal Pools because I got some ideas for our mining pool, so we'll have to reach out to them.

[35:22] **qx()**: And the cool thing, too, about Crystal Pools and Trade House is that potentially they can start sharing liquidity. And then, perhaps, too, Luivatra is trying to do some, what's it, buys or sells? or something with some limit orders with the Spectrum liquidity pool. So when these first came out, when Crystal Pools and Trade House came out, kushti was like, Oh, can you integrate Spectrum liquidity pool? So it's possible, I think. But that'd be really neat.

[35:53] **Marc the Shark**: Really, really, especially for like slippage, you know, for some of these tokens, you like, like we're talking like, I'm not sure about Bober, for example, but like, say you're a Bober whale, and you're trying to liquidate

[36:03] **Marc the Shark**: you know, probably going to be a lot of slippage fees, I guess, or something like that. So I guess that would be when that would write.

[36:09] **qx()**: That would be something that would help negate that or totally give you a great visualization of where your slippage is going to occur at exactly what level and how many how much how much how much token is there for you to get before that slippage occurs. So that's the beauty of those kind of ordered order books. You can see that precisely when that's going to happen and how much depth there is. So transparency. That's what's up. Yeah. Yeah. Speaking of Bober,

[36:32] **qx()**: I was talking to maverick earlier. He was setting up mgPai ErgPy I always tell mgPai you cannot abandon that tool. That's like the best gateway drug into into the Ergo ecosystem I mean, who doesn't know Python Chad BGPD knows Python for shit sake, you know, I mean you can definitely use it for for anything so I was talking to maverick and he was we were talking I don't know how we got the subject about it, but we were talking about central exchanges

[37:00] **qx()**: and how him and some other people were chatting about it at their poker night. I think Pixel and a few other people in Kilver. And they were talking about the benefits of central exchange listings. And he said something really that made a lot of sense. He said, and I think we should change our narrative based on that, at least when these kind of things happen. He said, you know, they're talking and with central exchanges, the listings, everybody thinks they're for the immediate everybody thinks like at least for Ergo that it's a pump, it's going to pump the price and then we're going to the price is going to stay up or maybe trickle down a little bit, but it's going to be a pump.

[37:37] **qx()**: But historically, we've seen with all the listings that we've had so far, at least in my recent memory, and even other people's listings, it doesn't sustain that way. Either it doesn't ever blip, like MEXC didn't even do anything. It just went down. So he said, look, he said, we really need to be thinking about this as we are setting up the framework for when people finally realize what Ergo is and why they need it.

[38:08] **qx()**: And then at that point, they're going to be able to access it in the United States, they're going to be able to access it in Indonesia, they're going to be able to access it wherever they need to, because we'll already be on those exchanges. So I think that's a really good point. If we start looking at these exchange listings as not something that's going to be for a pump, an immediate price pump, but something that's laying the framework for accessibility for the not-so-far or the far future, then perhaps a community might be a little bit easier to, more willing to invest in it for that kind of long-term investment, as well as manage their expectations of what its price might even go down because people speculate against it, trade against it at that point.

[38:48] **qx()**: But I thought it was, you know, fairly insightful and a semi decent kind of narrative to to put forward when when these kind of things are happening.

[39:00] **Marc the Shark**: Yeah, absolutely. Because yeah, because I think ultimately, right, we want to bring on more users. And, you know, more on ramp, right? That's kind of really what we're driving towards, I would say. And, and I think, yeah, a lot of the times it's correlated centralized exchanges.

[39:17] **qx()**: With onboarding more users But yeah, like you're suggesting it's not all that's not always good for the price No, right, so but people have this huge expectation that that's what's gonna happen Then they're let down and then that trickles and cascades even more when they're disappointed and sell so it's just I think if we do a good job of saying that right off the front that

[39:39] **qx()**: Hey guys, here's the listing we're going for next. Historically, remember, this is what happens when we list. So just a reminder, this is why we're listing. This is actually the true nature of why we're listing. We're listing for better access to this adoption. Not everybody can mine, so some people are left to buy it, of course. So this gives a better access not only for right in the immediate, but far into the future.

[40:04] **Marc the Shark**: And it's like, there's not really a healthy expectation to just because we get a tier one listing, we're going to go to the moon. But what happens if we don't, what's going to be your narrative? Yeah, why, you know what I mean? And so from some aspects, again, it's like, let's not worry about like, our expectations where we should be. Why aren't we there? Let's worry about now today, let's continue to build forward. And, you know, maybe eventually we'll get there. But

[40:28] **Marc the Shark**: If we focus too much on our expectations, especially in terms of price, it really doesn't help anybody. You know what I mean? You could even see this like in your own personal life, just laying out specific expectations, like, oh, this happens or, oh, whatever the case, then you get upset. You get upset with other people, you get upset with yourself. It doesn't really help anybody. So you got to kind of level set your own expectations. Cause otherwise you should kind of be, you're going to make yourself kind of like an asshole, I guess. And I don't know.

[40:58] **qx()**: All right, how about we dive into the dev updates?

[41:01] **Marc the Shark**: Let's do it. Can you ping the specific where we're starting at?

[41:07] **qx()**: Yeah, look back on the date 6-26-2024. It starts with Aberg, and I can get started with Aberg while you find it. OK, cool. You'll see kushti tag everybody for let's have a chat.

[41:23] **qx()**: All right, so we have Aberg as a Satergo dev. So check our dev update. Improved keyboard navigation. Oh, nice. Improved the screen reader experience so that blind people can use a wallet in a better way. Fixed so that screen readers read dialogs. That's awesome, Aberg. Improved the extended seed password, aka BIP-39 password, aka mnemonic password presentation to these. I remember that chat. I don't know if he brought that up in the Sigmanauts or the dev update, but that was a funny chat. He got, I think he got a lot of advice that he wasn't necessarily looking for that moment. He was like, I felt like he was about to say, fuck this. I'm not happy that I asked, you know, the app build is a bit smaller now. Awesome. Next working on tools section with tools like burn tokens, combine UTXOs transfer everything and airdrop.

[42:14] **qx()**: I wonder if we could talk Aberg into integrating the, the filter list too, as a, opt in if you want to. I know Nautilus defaults to opt you in, but, you know, Aberg might be better, better minded or, you know, prefer on his tool to maybe just have an opt in option as opposed to automatically opt in. Super cool. Oh, we got your favorite right here. Crystal Pools up next.

[42:41] **Marc the Shark**: All right, so create slash unlock wallet done, found a balanced UX security trade off. mnemonic is stored encrypted with password and local storage, but survives page refresh and is shared across tabs with service workers. service worker, added token selection widget for deposits, working in deposits proxy address for mobile wallet deposits. Sweet.

[43:13] **qx()**: All right, what do we have right here? We've got kushti up next. Ergo protocol R&D, most of time spent on this pull, finally had to rewrite paging logic completely. Now that there are tests, manual tests done as well. Next, unspent API methods for blockchain as paging logic there is different. Testing 5.0.22, still a lot of things to check it seems. Mostly finished with the Scala sigma state interpreter on this poll. We'll push soon and then we'll review what's left for Sigma 6 again, a side of new bigint type.

[43:47] **qx()**: Dexy discussing main net launch with code for us and others nice ChainCash fixed Shamir issue discussing further work on ChainCash server with Dusek And looks like you've got another guy we were talking about earlier Or another project we were talking about earlier Yes, and not all this really stable v zero point one one point zero and

[44:15] **Marc the Shark**: added EIP-44 support, arbitrary data signing, and then Fleet SDK released v0.50. Have to take a look at that. SIGMIFY revamped the UI with focus on usability, and then other Sigma Rust fixed WASM type exporting for modern bundlers, and then asking kushti and Dusek to review.

[44:45] **qx()**: We've got Luivatra with Sun Paideia. UI fixes and updates, working on moving last remaining DanAids calls to use index node CruxFinance API instead. Done contract work for treasury consolidation, contract work for min-state amount for proposal creation, allowing DAOs to limit who can create proposals based on stake size. Oh, interesting. Max value for this is always half total staked amount to prevent locking a DAO.

[45:16] **qx()**: So this is neat. So the way Paideia works, everybody, if you're not familiar with it, is you're given DAO tokens. Essentially, when you create a DAO, you bind tokens to it. And you say, hey, when this DAO was made, this is a damn governance token. And it's a token that you mint. So then it's your job to distribute those tokens. So you can distribute those, just like, let's say, how we did for Ergo hack. So I took Ergo hack, for the community results. I gave five tokens to everybody who donated to the raffle. I gave two tokens to the Sigmanauts cause they were running the whole thing. And I gave one token to the faucet people who connected the faucet in the community and wanted to vote themselves.

[45:59] **qx()**: So what this is saying, what this will do is this will say, okay, we only want people with, four or more tokens to be able to actually create proposals. So that would essentially make it so that only the people that voted in the raffles could then create proposals for people to vote on and the Sigmanauts with two tokens and the community with one token wouldn't be able to do that. So it really kind of segments it out at all. What it allows it allows for

[46:25] **qx()**: a broader range of participation, while still kind of controlling a little bit of the top part. Where, you know, you maybe want a lot of community consensus and community participation, but you don't necessarily want somebody coming off the street like Sahar and making a fucking Paideia proposal about, I don't know, BRICK or his balls or something. You know, so this kind of stuff really, really helps with that. So it's really good to see.

[46:53] **qx()**: With CruxFinance, refactoring the backend for dex data as it was quite Spectrum specific. Almost done integrating Trade House order history and order book data. Oh, nice. Soon we'll show combined order history for the different DEXes and which DEX on order is executed on. Also differentiating between orders made on Spectrum UI, CruxFinance, DEX, or other UIs or direct LP interaction. With the refactoring done, it is much more generic. So adding Crystal Pools will be fairly trivial. Awesome. So he'll get all those in. CruxFinance, it seems like it's really coming along to be the Swiss Army knife of kind of portfolio viewing. It's great.

[27:29] **Marc the Shark**: Yeah, definitely. Yeah, a really cool tool. You guys have probably heard enough about our mining pool, but we're working on running on Flux. Actually, Second Lucky Time Mining, he's been a huge help with that. And so, yeah, looking on running it on Flux, we don't block down the dash, or rather the mining core. Specifically, we're going to run it on ergo-miners.com. So I bought that domain. That's not up yet, but TBD. We already talked about this. It's not a vote yet, but it's a proposal. And then I'm looking at the register R9 for miner ID NFTs just so we can add

[48:11] **Marc the Shark**: Just some type of photo. Shout out to everybody who donated for the raffle. We've got RSBTC for bonus rewards. And then we're just waiting on qx() to finalize the APIs so we can open up the beta for swapping.

[48:32] **qx()**: We're pumping out that. I'm pumping that out, all right?

[48:36] **Marc the Shark**: Yeah, we just need the APIs right so I can put in the dash stuff and then we can open it to other people.

[48:42] **qx()**: I thought you meant bonus rewards as in somebody donated.

[48:44] **Marc the Shark**: Yes, that is done. Yeah, that's all integrated. Yep, great.

[48:50] **qx()**: Oh, we've got a big one from Rosen Bridge. Here we go. The bridge scanner, they added authentication to the RPC scanner. For Bitcoin, added random ID to Bitcoin RPC scanner API calls. Fixed address extractor, update query not to store duplicate boxes. I wonder if they did this to stop people from getting rate limited, if that's what they're talking about. Perhaps that means, but imagine whoever they're calling.

[49:20] **qx()**: Well, there are some RPC providers. It's kind of like another method to get information from a node, from the blockchain. So random ID to Bitcoin RPC security API calls. I don't know. I think I'm overthinking that. That's probably not what I think of this. Fix address extractor update query not to store duplicate boxes. Fix abstract extractor spend info extraction. This was a node issue that I think they're working on fixing too. This is not necessarily a Rosen Bridge, but they fixed, they'd made a workaround until the nodes fixed for that.

[49:52] **qx()**: I think it was showing duplicate boxes after a certain, if there were over 200 boxes in the wallet, I think it would start showing duplicate boxes. So not like you can do anything with it. It's just a reporting issue. It's not like you can double spend a box. That's the beauty of Ergo. It's just reporting that it's there.

[50:12] **qx()**: Apparently there's a bug when signing Bitcoin transaction using hardware wallet through Xdefi. We contacted Xdefi team and they are checking it. This is on the Rosen Bridge, Rosen app. Disable submit button while the fees are being fetched. Invalidate stale fee data when any source target or token changes. Add rate limiting to APIs and service actions as a prerequisite for enabling Rosen API access to the public. Prevent events page from crashing if networks inside of the code differ from the ones in tokens file. Enhance the code quality within the wallet and network modules to ensure robustness and maintainability.

[50:46] **qx()**: Develop the core logic for the X-verse wallet. Implement dynamic refresh functionality for available wallet extensions during runtime. Optimize the assets page by improving its logic, responsiveness, and overall user experience. For the Rosen Bridge health check, they add random ID,

[51:03] **qx()**: and authentication for Bitcoin RPC scanner health parameter, update all parameters, format, and descriptions for the next version. For the CLI, they added a tag option to CLI download assets for downloading specific version of assets. Oh, that's great. The CLI watches finally used, I think, once to salt their passwords. So every once in a while, watches will probably dip into the CLI. Luckily, the Rosen team, they're great. They made a Docker for it. So essentially, you just download the Docker. You don't have to change anything in your system and just throw it a command and it spits out what you need. Rosen Bridge notification, finish implementation of the abstract package and start working on Discord package.

[51:46] **Marc the Shark**: Nice. So we have Luivatra. I completely forgot. A week is a long time. Indexed node with a GraphQL facade for use in Nautilus. It uses indexed node instead of Explorer and feeds mempool data as it is confirmed. So balances real time, although with double spending, et cetera. It could show buggy numbers using indexed node instead of Explorer is easier to distribute. So even without the mempool stuff could be interesting.

[52:20] **qx()**: All right, we've got, oh, even mgPai says it's very cool. Got the mgPai stamp of approval.

[52:27] **qx()**: All right, we've got Death Grips On. No, Death Grips On, as Joe told me last week. Analog Ergo atomic swap, second place winner, third place winner. Integrated several market price APIs for Ergo and Ethereum price feeds, such as Bitpanda, Kraken, et cetera. Almented order type updating allows market server to config order types, grab prices from market APIs, and update all order types on an interval. Includes things like min and max volume, price rounding, and which market API to get prices from per order type. Account creation generalization removed any hard coding relating to accounts, servers, and clients that automatically find accounts created by the users. CLI account setup script also updated for generalization.

[53:11] **qx()**: Market server blocking operations fixed. Any operation that requires more than an instant prevents the server from serving other clients during the long process wrapping in. allows it to execute in parallel without blocking the main event loop. ErgoScript verification bug fix removed multiple calls to get height. The market server was getting blockchain height multiple times during contract deployment. This led to server sending a slightly different static lock height to the client if a new block was found during deployment.

[53:39] **qx()**: and a real verification failure, a client will refuse fulfilling the swap and refund their own coins from their side of the atomic swap contract. I can't imagine how complex this thing that Death Grips On is building. It's pretty amazing.

[53:54] **Marc the Shark**: Absolutely.

[53:55] **qx()**: And then a BRICK asked me for prices from Spectrum and I gave him the wrong URL to be an asshole Just kidding. It's the right URL. Let's see kushti changed his His image to the astronaut and this is what we're gonna make some t-shirts We're gonna try to make some t-shirts for Rare Evo and we're gonna put this astronaut on the old-style Aston, it's gonna be great

[54:18] **qx()**: It's going to be great again.

[54:20] **Marc the Shark**: Absolutely.

[54:24] **qx()**: Let's see. Anything else here? We're on the 27th. That was it, sir.

[54:30] **Marc the Shark**: Okay, cool. Nice, nice, nice.

[54:34] **qx()**: Is this your first Ergoversary?

[54:37] **Marc the Shark**: Yeah, officially, I suppose, yeah.

[54:47] **Marc the Shark**: Can we sing?

[54:53] **Marc the Shark**: What do you want to sing?

[54:55] **qx()**: Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday dear Ergo. Happy birthday to you.

[55:15] **qx()**: There's our musical birthday number for Ergo.

[55:24] **Marc the Shark**: Yeah, make it a memorable one.

[55:29] **qx()**: All right, Marc, anything you want to say before we part?

[55:33] **Marc the Shark**: No, yeah, appreciate it. Thanks for everybody's time. Let's live, laugh and love.

[55:38] **qx()**: What if we just want to live and laugh?

[55:44] **Marc the Shark**: Well, it's your own prerogative. Free world, I suppose, right?

[55:49] **qx()**: Oh, I always forget to mention, they're always so busy coding. Oh, what was it? Cyberverse did. What did they do this week? Do you remember what Cyberverse did this week? Was it something with Cardano again?

[56:06] **Marc the Shark**: Yeah, I think they have. No, yeah, what did they do?

[56:10] **qx()**: Well, we listed them on Trade House. So you can get Cyberverse token on Trade House. I think there's a decent amount of depth. I think there's like 300 or 400 in each direction. So that's there. It's one of the first project tokens to be on Trade House. So it's a good token to mess around with. And I posted it on the Cyberverse. Oh, that's what it is Cyberverse got a reddit a reddit subreddit so It's very specific to Cyberverse, which is great. So if you guys have time pop in there and you enjoy the game Check it out. Lots of fun.

[56:45] **Marc the Shark**: They're also doing an event. So if you have an NFT it gives an opportunity for you to figure out the lore of

[56:54] **Marc the Shark**: That's what it is. Yep, yep, yep. And then I think you get some type of surprise or something like that for it, which is pretty cool.

[57:02] **qx()**: Make up the lore for your own character, I think it is. And then they'll judge you on it and give you a prize based on the best ones. That's pretty cool. Yeah. Yeah.

[57:10] **Marc the Shark**: Yeah. Definitely. So what's your lore going to be?

[57:12] **qx()**: I don't know. My guy's like some, it's like some, he looks like kind of Marty outfit wearing, but different colors. And he's got like this robot semi mono glasses kind of thing on. So we'll see. We'll see what it is.

[57:29] **Marc the Shark**: I got a couple of redheaded guys. I think they'll be brothers or something like that. a different sombrero guy. Maybe he'll come back from the future to hunt down the brothers or something.

[57:39] **qx()**: They'll all be stepchildren, and they'll all be angels.

[57:42] **Marc the Shark**: Yeah, exactly. Ready to stepchildren with no souls, absolutely.

[57:49] **qx()**: Boys, that's funny. All right, great. I think it's 10:50 over here at my time It's time for me to settle down go to bed and we've got a whole another day tomorrow of more videos from all the way from people that we have no idea what
