[00:12] **kushti**: Hey everyone, how's it going?

[00:14] **qx()**: Hello, welcome everybody.

[00:16] **qx()**: Hi kushti, how you doing?

[00:18] **kushti**: Doing well, how about you?

[00:20] **qx()**: I'm hanging in there, still nursing off whatever I had a couple weeks ago, but maybe someday it'll get rid of it.

[00:27] **qx()**: Crazy. So it's lasted this long.

[00:29] **qx()**: You managed to not get sick this winter?

[00:34] **kushti**: Sorry?

[00:35] **qx()**: You managed to keep from getting sick this winter, kushti?

[00:39] **kushti**: Yeah, yeah, yeah, so still, yeah. I'm totally fine. And yeah, I even have a lot of power during the winter.

[00:50] **kushti**: So how's about your Sigmanauts power?

[00:54] **qx()**: Sigmanauts power.

[00:56] **qx()**: It's been slow burn this semester, I guess, this start of the quarter. I've been doing a lot of focusing outside of that on my Cornell stuff.

[01:10] **qx()**: What's today? Today's Thursday? So we didn't have the show. Yeah, so we had the show last week and I got some good ideas on how to help that BRICK economy get going.

[01:22] **qx()**: And the idea was that people were seeing our show and they're like, hey, why does this blockchain recycling have to stop after the show is over? And I was like, well, it doesn't. I said we could set this up upstairs in our IT place.

[01:36] **qx()**: And then another idea came that what could facilitate more value pointed towards BRICKs, Cornell BRICK. And the idea is, okay, we can blend the two.

[01:46] **qx()**: So instead of students throwing out their massive amounts of paper after they're done critiquing, you know, we're talking four or five huge, like 42 by 60 inch print outs, we can have a large bin in our area and every time a student brings one of those plots to recycle after they're done with it, we can hand them off like ten BRICK or five BRICK or fifteen BRICK.

[02:14] **qx()**: So this will not only encourage students to bring their plots back and actually recycle them instead of throwing them in the garbage or letting them fall on the floor and the custodial staff takes care of them in the garbage. But it'll also put an even bigger system of value in place for the BRICK in that it's a reward token for recycling your plot.

[02:32] **qx()**: which you can then use after probably, we're thinking maybe every six or seven plots recycled, you'll generate enough BRICK to print another plot for free. So there's incentive for kids to actually recycle them and get that BRICK in turn for value to then put it back into the system and plot with it.

[02:52] **qx()**: So that's our next step in doing that. I've been thoroughly testing my system set up and it's been running well for me printing from it with blockchain payments. So that part's ready to go.

[03:05] **qx()**: So once we get that bin set up, we'll start that and get going. It's going to be interesting. A lot of kids are excited. So we'll see.

[03:15] **kushti**: Yeah. That's actually quite amazing. So I thought actually, well, I've been thinking actually, well, for many years about, you know, creating monetary systems where money created, you know, when people, well, recycling wastes, you know, doing, well, positive things like trees planting, reforestation, stuff like that.

[03:47] **kushti**: Yeah, and well, it could be more useful than those carbon credits, right? Yeah, there are two tokens, so carbon credits and there is also debit token, I believe, carbon credits.

[04:05] **kushti**: From what I know about that system, it's usually not about carbon at all in the real world. Usually those credits are being used to cover many holes different agencies like UN agencies have.

[04:29] **kushti**: In general, from what I know, that system is not working well. It's possible to design high belief systems in bottom-up fashion, which will work better. Well, a way to emit new money, right, when students are bringing plots to be reused.

[04:59] **kushti**: So, yeah, it's quite exciting, actually, experiment.

[05:01] **qx()**: Exactly. Try to create some sort of local incentive that really has a direct effect on the students and I mean honestly these students may somewhat care about recycling but you know they don't have time for it it's not at the top of their mind but if you provide some sort of incentive directly to them where the effort is low too they simply have to just walk 50 feet over to our office and dump a plot in a bin and then we tip them the BRICK, I mean, that's going to be some very simple incentive to do this kind of stuff.

[05:32] **qx()**: So yeah, super excited about that. We'll see how they respond to that. My guess is, you know, Cornell is like many Ivy schools, there's a lot of cash tuition students, I imagine. So you'll have a mix of students who just don't give a crap. And then you'll have a mix of students who will be like, you don't care? Give me your plot. I'll recycle it for you. And they take the BRICK out of it.

[06:02] **qx()**: So I think you'll see a lot of that. So you'll get this active cleanup of people who want free plots walking around the 350 student studio and being like, hey, are you done with that? Can I recycle that? You know, that kind of thing. So it'll be an interesting economy there.

[06:16] **qx()**: I'm really interested to see how it's going to play out. And then they were also talking about yeah, what if I leave or what if I no longer have to do plots this semester or, you know, what if there's no value in the token that's valuable to me?

[06:31] **qx()**: And then the kids were like, oh, you know, I'll give you, you give me your tokens and I'll buy you some coffee or I'll buy you lunch at the restaurant downstairs or that kind of thing. So those are neat swaps that could be happening too.

[06:46] **kushti**: Yeah, that's quite amazing. Comparing with other ways to emit new money we have in the crypto space. For example, airdrops. Usually airdrops is when you're just rewarding people for creating accounts, right?

[07:06] **kushti**: And social media wealth and you are basically basically incentivizing spam, right? So creating spam accounts and Facebook, social media to get more airdrop tokens.

[07:20] **kushti**: But here you have some real and positive way, right? And while it's still based on a trusted party like an airdrop, but yeah, at least you know, well, distribution has some antecedent mechanism and you also will bring in a positive impact in return, right, like waste recycling.

[07:45] **kushti**: That's actually quite awesome. And have you announced the community chats we will have?

[07:56] **qx()**: No, let me do that today. Why don't you announce it in person right here and then we'll announce it on Twitter later.

[08:02] **kushti**: Yeah, but so what's the time? Is it 3 or 4 p.m.? I propose both times. Let's pick one.

[08:14] **qx()**: That's UTC proposed?

[08:16] **kushti**: Yeah, yeah, so 4 p.m. UTC maybe.

[08:18] **qx()**: Yeah, that's beautiful. Yeah, that works.

[08:22] **kushti**: All right, so next Tuesday will be February 4th. Yeah, so let's meet our community town hall and discuss different well, monetary innovation aspects we have in the Ergo Core protocol and the ecosystem.

[08:43] **kushti**: And, well, not just dApps, but maybe things like BRICKs would be good to get more insights on that actually. But yeah, we will also discuss storage rent for sure, then algorithmic monetary policies, well, emission reduction and possible effects, right?

[09:10] **kushti**: So if we are talking about the native cryptocurrency, then yeah, we can discuss custom emission contracts, FIMO, miners rights protocol. So all those things.

[09:28] **qx()**: We can talk a little bit about the storage rent too. Let's bring that to the front of the picture too. Cause I think as of now, it's still just Sigmanauts pool doing it and a few independent devs doing some sniping as well So it'd be nice to get that word spread out more I'll try to maybe I'll invite the DX pool guys have them announce it in their channel as well as others

[09:56] **kushti**: Recently, Sigmanauts collected some good amounts of ERGs, like 14 ERGs.

[10:07] **qx()**: I didn't see that one, but yeah, there's been times where we've had two or three ERGs in one shot in the storage rent pool. It's pretty impressive. Five, I think, was the one that I noticed a couple of weeks ago.

[10:18] **qx()**: Yeah, super cool, super impressive that that happens. I don't think people realize. Because we're on the Ergo how amazing that is but if you get somebody on another chain I bet, well that's tough too because Bitcoin maxis are like, oh, it's great that coins are lost, right? They're like that's beneficial to the system So it is a little tough sell to those guys, but I think it's amazing

[10:45] **kushti**: Yeah, but yeah, well, there are some heated talks in the Bitcoin community as well, right? So it would be good to get Bitcoiners joining discussions as well. Yeah, so some good tokens got storage rented recently as well. I've seen that one of the earliest Ergo Lore series NFTs got collected and then burned something like that.

[11:21] **kushti**: So there was some interesting story. I don't know, maybe accidentally burnt. So, well, that's also interesting question, right? So what are the burning practices in storage rent? And yeah, actually, it's quite interesting because, well, every party which is collecting so Sigmanauts of those individual snipers so that they can use different strategies, right? That's quite funny.

[11:52] **qx()**: So briefly, chat on that, kushti. So there was an early conception, an early idea that miners were the only ones that were allowed to recreate boxes, right? But you had mentioned in an AMA at one point that that's not entirely true at this point anymore.

[12:09] **qx()**: And now anybody can try to include the transaction in a block. It's up to the miners to include it or not, but anybody can take any of the storage rent if they get their transaction picked up in the block. Is that true?

[12:23] **kushti**: Oh, it's actually how it was designed since day one, right? So, well, no need to log to minerspubkey or whatever. Well, miners always can reshuffle transactions, right? So, well, if some sniper dev is collecting storage rent. So, supposedly, if miners are not lazy, they will just throw away such transactions from the block, right, and replace with own storage rent.

[12:58] **kushti**: It's in some theory, right, where miners are well behaving rationally, right, so maximizing their profits. And what we have in practice, some miners are well a little bit weird, right, mostly. So they're not maximizing their profits even, which is quite counterintuitive.

[13:22] **qx()**: Right, right. So this storage rent was kind of designed in mind that, yeah, once it was able to be active, you'll get the pools to pick it up. But we're kind of in a limbo state right now where not all the pools are picking it up yet.

[13:36] **qx()**: And devs have the ability, or anybody that can write that code has the ability to snipe themselves the storage rent if they want to. In an ideal scenario, and I imagine how you designed it, was that once every pool is on storage rent, the dev snipers don't matter because the mining pools will just replace those sniper TXs with their own TXs to claim storage rent in the blocks they find.

[14:01] **kushti**: Right. And well, eventually we will get to that stage, right?

[14:07] **qx()**: Interesting transition stage, though.

[14:09] **kushti**: Yeah, so when emission would be low, like three ERGs per block, right, so there will be a lot of incentive, right, to collect storage rent. So not to be lazy about additional source of income.

[14:27] **qx()**: But speaking of storage rent.

[14:29] **Dan Friedman**: Did you just say transaction?

[14:32] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah, but you also said it's lazy. You didn't say transaction. You said transaction. What's a transaction QX?

[14:42] **qx()**: That's a new term. It's a quantum based transaction.

[14:47] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah, no no kushti didn't say you said it.

[14:50] **qx()**: Oh, I said it. I can't speak I've got like a pound of like whatever in my face I can't speak at all.

[14:55] **Dan Friedman**: I got a pound of New York.

[14:57] **qx()**: Yeah, I got a pound of New York Well speaking of storage rent kushti there's $20,000 worth of liquidity in the ERG/PHP token that was picked up by storage rent the first Big big pull for the whole PHP token so 20 grand of liquidity. I think that's pretty damn amazing.

[15:15] **kushti**: All right, so wait, so basically 20k USD worth of value are now because of, well, basically digital waste recycling, right?

[15:38] **qx()**: Yeah, exactly, exactly.

[15:40] **kushti**: That's quite fine. I mean, that's the whole new dimension in the understanding of blockchain economic protocols maybe, right? So when you can get new value from recycling digital waste basically on the blockchain. That's very funny actually.

[16:05] **qx()**: I mean, it's a narrative, right? Only on the Ergo. Really cool.

[16:09] **kushti**: Yeah, so, well, actually, it's quite strange even, right? So, well, Ergo was launched back in 2019 and still it's the only blockchain with storage rent, right? well, generic sigma protocols language, right? So, the ability to create cryptographic protocols as applications, right? Variety of cryptographic protocols and so on.

[16:37] **kushti**: So, yeah, well, it's even strange that no one is copying that, but maybe because the time is a bit different now, it's not 2015 anymore, so people are just, well, those days are doing somewhat, I don't know, new BFT protocols and then trying to will present them as proof of stake like I don't know Cardano's you know proof of stake so like no normal proof of stake but yeah actually it's just BFT under the hood so well more centralized consensus protocol obviously and then yeah they just have EVM on top of so well it's now about like 100 chains which are pretty indistinguishable to me.

[17:35] **kushti**: So what's varying there is a set of venture capital funds backing those protocols. That's the most differentiating part usually those days.

[17:56] **kushti**: Talking about miners, Dan, how are lithium miners doing? Different kind of miners. Any news from your side, from real-world mining?

[18:10] **Dan Friedman**: Our partners, the ones that we're building the lithium index with, one of them is actually, I guess, in whatever it's called, well, the circle, so the circle to be picked as the mining secretary for Argentina.

[18:39] **Dan Friedman**: So just like with all appointments, there's several leading candidates, and then one of them gets appointed. So he's a leading candidate to get appointed to the mining secretary of Argentina. So we're definitely going to be into mining big time.

[19:01] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah. And so, yeah, we're actually connecting with other lithium pricing source providers because we're trying to build out an Oracle network to supply all these different prices for the lithium index. So, yeah, we're making connections to other mining organizations and companies and widening out our network.

[19:28] **Dan Friedman**: So yeah, we're quite a lot of mining happening in a literal sense. And yeah, and actually, I was telling QX that our Biz Dev lead in Buenos Aires is... My Argentinian friends keep telling me how to say it right now. I was Americanized it too much.

[20:01] **Dan Friedman**: So he is an Ergo fan and so our partner, one of our partners from Buenos Aires, they run an on-chain payment network, and of course, you know, legacy and on-chain payment network.

[20:22] **Dan Friedman**: And these guys have, and I think I told you, QX, about this. I'm pretty sure I did. In fact, I'm positive I did. They got a huge mining farm for Bitcoin.

[20:36] **Dan Friedman**: And so they wanted to actually know what can be done with Ergo if they were going to turn that on to Ergo. But the problem is that the bulk of it is ASIC.

[20:51] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah, so that's the problem. They have some video card, just strictly video card-based miners, but the bulk of it is ASICs. So we're trying to figure it out.

[21:07] **Dan Friedman**: We're going to see what can be done with the ones that are not ASICs, which could still help, help secure the network. But it would be really nice if we could turn on the bulk of these things. But the bulk of these things, yeah. Unfortunately they're ASICs, but well, we'll see what we can do so They're gonna sell them for GPUs and I'll let him know that Just take like a 30% hit no big deal They got like some insane amount of hash like hash rate happening with all those ASICs like it's told me I was like, holy shit.

[21:48] **Dan Friedman**: I mean it's It's one of the largest ones in Argentina, I think.

[21:53] **Dan Friedman**: Do they have hydro nearby?

[21:58] **Dan Friedman**: Well, so even hydroelectric? Yes. Yeah, actually, there's quite a bit of hydroelectric in Argentina. In fact, I think that there are, I've heard, I haven't actually seen them, but I've heard that there are hydro-powered miners in Argentina for Bitcoin.

[22:19] **Dan Friedman**: So I, you know, I'm also going to research that, see what we can do for Ergo. There's quite a bit, you know, because Argentina is, is like very, like adaptive now to try and get, try to get into the opportunities that they have now, because it just really opened up after you know, decades of corruption, and then, you know, just literally like I think Milei is literally the first guy who really kind of opened up Argentina.

[22:47] **Dan Friedman**: And so now they're just opening up, they're like, oh, wait, wait, we got all this opportunity now. Okay, so what can we do? And so of course, the first thing they're doing is jumping into a bunch of Bitcoin stuff. But we will, you know, I'll see what I can do to guide them in the right direction, so to speak.

[23:05] **Dan Friedman**: Maybe we'll send QX out there in his poncho and they'll think he's local.

[23:11] **qx()**: No, that's perfect. Lucy and I can go down and I'll wear my poncho. She can wear her poncho.

[23:18] **Dan Friedman**: You know the thing about Argentina, I know it's kind of a duh, but like, you go to Argentina, and you know it's big on the map, but you don't realize how big it is. It's freaking big, man. There's a lot of Argentina.

[23:32] **Dan Friedman**: I took so many plane rides, all these different provinces. And actually, yeah, I think actually in Cordoba, there could be some hydroelectric opportunities. Also, I think I might have something, so we do have some connections there that I can tap into if you have something in mind for some hydro-powered mining stuff.

[24:05] **qx()**: Well, for ASICs, we'd have to wait for some sort of sidechain, right?

[24:10] **Dan Friedman**: I'm not saying all of them are ASICs, just this one partner of ours has a huge amount of ASIC rigs. And so I was trying to, because they were really interested in mining Ergo, but then they gave me the configurations and I'm like, oh, wait a second, yeah, that's not going to work. It's not going to work here.

[24:31] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah, yeah, yeah. So there's going to be something, you know, I mean, like I said, they're very, very open to opportunity over there, so.

[24:40] **qx()**: Dan, I saw you repping Ergo with your Ergo sweatshirt on your talk with Charles Hoskinson.

[24:47] **qx()**: How'd that go?

[24:48] **Dan Friedman**: Hoskinson? Who's that?

[24:49] **qx()**: I don't even know his last name. I don't pay attention to that crap.

[24:52] **Dan Friedman**: What's his last name? Is it like Rubenstein or something? What is it?

[24:56] **qx()**: How'd you guess? How'd you guess?

[24:59] **Dan Friedman**: Oh, Hoskinson?

[25:00] **qx()**: There you go. How'd that go? You repped Ergo? You had your shirt out that you stole from us?

[25:04] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Some weirdo gave me that t-shirt, or gave me that sweatshirt, and I kind of like it. So yeah, I thought I'd rep Ergo. I was kind of thinking. I'm like, hmm, well, this is the Cardano founder. But then I'm like, oh yeah, but he's also an Ergo guy too, so it's cool. And yeah, I just, you know.

[25:25] **qx()**: It worked out but yeah Do I wear the t-shirt with soy sauce stains on it or do I wear the Ergo shirt?

[25:33] **Dan Friedman**: It was a tough choice That is that is pretty racist you think because I live in Asia I'll have soy sauce stains on my shirt That's just you've been canceled QX. I just can't do it Andy Andy cut his feet cut his feet Andy

[25:50] **qx()**: So how was the, how was your presale? I saw you announced round two.

[25:54] **Dan Friedman**: Well, so, so like, you know, with Charles, the talk with Charles is really good. We actually mentioned, Oh, thank you. Thank you. Oh, damn, he's back.

[26:05] **Dan Friedman**: Anyway, yeah, so we actually did talk about Ergo a bit. And so there's, you know, it's just very interesting because, you know, Charles is kind of into partner change right now. So he's kind of, you know, multi-chaining, multi-chain surfing right now.

[26:27] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah, yeah, the pre-sale is doing really good. Yeah, we're in phase three now, so phase one and two is done. Phase three is going, and yeah, I mean, we got everything lined up. We're going to go TGE next month.

[26:45] **Dan Friedman**: Got some RSV that came in through the pre-sale. Because we, you know, like, are basically, you can participate in the pre-sale with RSV, ADA, USDM, and that's it, I think. And maybe there's something, one more.

[27:07] **Dan Friedman**: But anyway, oh, and of course, you know, we got Pyro on our team now. I don't know if you know this or not, but Pyro has joined our team a couple of months ago. So, we are now, four, out of, well, five actually, cause Sam was also an Ergonaut. So, out of a team of 20 that are Ergo peeps, we got Luca, we got Shashir, you know, and we got, yeah.

[27:41] **Dan Friedman**: Oh, oh, and, Rob just joined the team as well.

[27:45] **qx()**: Wait, Rob, Rob, Rob.

[27:47] **Dan Friedman**: No rob, i'm gonna butcher them Luivatra You stole Luivatra.

[27:57] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah. Yeah, he's mine now gosh in the back You done Luivatra there goes Paideia Yeah, yeah, we're gonna have to hire somebody for Paideia To the clutches of Palmyra

[28:15] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah. So yeah, yeah. He's working with us now as well. So we got, yeah, we got Luivatra. We got me, Sam, Shashir, Luca, Pyro. So it's like the Ergo All-Stars. I mean, Alex is advising us.

[28:32] **Dan Friedman**: The only one that's left out with no chair when the music stops is QX. What's up there?

[28:37] **qx()**: I figured that was intentional, Dan. I figured it was intentional.

[28:40] **Dan Friedman**: So I think that's a feature, not a bug.

[28:44] **qx()**: I think it's great that you're, you know, cause one of the things you notice in, at least in the bear market, we noticed that, you know, devs need to eat something, right? It's people like mgPai going to school, they need some sort of sustenance to be able to survive.

[28:57] **qx()**: And the fact that, at least Palmyra right now can provide who's Ergo, who's part of Ergo, part of Cardano. who can provide these devs with some sort of sustenance so that they can survive on chain and continue to be here is fantastic.

[29:12] **Dan Friedman**: I like to have a pool of talent I can pull from. It's people that I know, people that I can trust. For me, right now, it would be a pain to go through the entire process. I'd rather actually work with somebody I know. Ergo's got oodles of amazing devs and builders in the ecosystem, so that's why we're working with the ecosystem. It only makes sense.

[29:53] **qx()**: Well, kushti, we didn't hear what's new from you.

[29:56] **kushti**: A lot of things. But yeah, there was intense chats, the developers chat yesterday, as usually. So yeah, well, sub-blocks implementation is going well. So yeah, I made some API methods even. So now I'm checking how things are progressing well with some API methods.

[30:22] **kushti**: Then, yeah, well, all the issues found in 6.0 are fixed. So I'm going for public testnet release. So, well, looking, trying to find who is mining in the testnet. It seems it is you, right? Only if it's you. But yeah, I don't know. There is some miner, but cannot really find it.

[30:48] **qx()**: I think that's mgPai. My node is up to date and my mining core is running fine on my server, but I think when I tried to remote into my basement miner, it was choking.

[31:00] **kushti**: There is no need to mine, right? There is need to find the current miner. It's one party at the moment, some party, but it's not Michael, it's not mgPai.

[31:16] **qx()**: Oh, it's not mgPai.

[31:17] **kushti**: Yeah, it's not you then. I don't know. So we need to update the public testnet. So to make a warning and activation of 6.0, I think it's quite ready. And then, yeah, well, final audit and we are good for mainnet warning and activation.

[31:43] **kushti**: Then, Yeah, well, pushing DEX developers also, well, it's a little bit hard because, well, it seems that there is no synchronization, basically. So trying to get guys in sync, to get UI and main deployments finally done. Well, it's a long story, but Yeah, at this point, well, the only thing I can do is just push the front-end and back-end developers to get in sync and deliver the back-end and UI.

[32:33] **kushti**: Then what else? Also, participating in some forum discussions in regards to real-world assets and DAO. Actually, it's interesting to have Luivatra in Palmyra because there is a transmute DAO idea on the forum by some guy.

[33:01] **Dan Friedman**: Well, we're actually setting up a DAO for Palmyra Economy. That's one of our pillars for Palmyra Economy, is there's going to be a DAO that is basically going to work in a sense like one of the core entities to drive decentralized business development. So we'd use the DAO to vote on proposals like in Catalyst, but hopefully without all the drama, to develop business in different regions.

[33:31] **kushti**: Yeah, but then there could be also smaller DAOs like, well, I proposed many months before Paideia launch and we will propose again when I will have some time to have gold oracle pool operators DAO, which is uniting gold oracle pool operators with gold related products developers such as Gluon and Dexy.

[34:03] **kushti**: The idea is to have DAO with deciding some things in regards with how to spread reward tokens and so on. Currently it's done just in the chat but it would be more clear and more transparent to do with the DAO. The same could be done with lithium oracle operators and lithium product developers as well.

[34:28] **kushti**: It also would be an interesting option to have some smaller DAOs for very concrete and specific niches. Also writing some forum posts with some things well, which I'm talking about things like Cardano Summit, so maybe the North, if we had such discussions, right.

[35:00] **kushti**: So, well, the idea is how to have a unified vision, right, about what, well, the ecosystem is and could be, right, in the future. So, well, how to combine well DeFi we have and the real world assets and then well different peer-to-peer cache constructions well things like ChainCash and so on right to have some well ecosystem which is which can be well-transformative rights for large-scale transformations and mass adoption.

[35:57] **kushti**: We'll visit Hong Kong in February, so we'll see then again.

[36:07] **Dan Friedman**: So, actually, we've got to talk potentially about maybe doing some Palmyra Ergo thing over there. We've been talking to a friend. You know bond villain looking friend who who's been helping us set up some stuff in Hong Kong. So yeah, we got to talk about that off offline potentially.

[36:35] **Dan Friedman**: Well, we already talked about it, but we got to see what we can do because there's going to be quite a few people over there. I think that if we do an event in a kind of a nice place, not too huge, but something where it's going to be just very organic and interesting, I think, I think we can attract some people there. There's going to be, like I said, there's going to be a lot of like, you know, usually, you know, the Hong Kong events are pretty, like there, there's a lot of people, so it could potentially bring some, you know, a lot of fresh meat over there.

[37:11] **qx()**: There's an IHOP over there, isn't there Dan?

[37:15] **Dan Friedman**: In Hong Kong? I know there's Anytime Fitness in Hong Kong. That's also how I chart the world, because I got this gym membership that actually works in several countries, including the US. It's a US company that actually operates a pretty large gym network in Japan.

[37:41] **Dan Friedman**: So they're really big in Japan, but there's quite a few of them in the US, plus some other countries. With Singapore, there was Anytime Fitness in Singapore and other Asian countries. And so I just kind of always chart my travels. I don't feel like looking for a hotel with a gym because those are more expensive.

[38:06] **Dan Friedman**: So I'll just get an Airbnb next at Anytime Fitness. And yeah, the closest IHOP I know is actually in Dubai, I think. Yeah, Dubai, Dubai is the, yeah, whenever I'm in Dubai, I always hit up the IHOP over there. So I don't have to go down to the US, but unfortunately they haven't discovered the wonder of IHOP in Japan, but yeah, QX.

[38:33] **Dan Friedman**: So when we're there at Rare Evo, you're gonna be at Rare Evo, right?

[38:37] **qx()**: Next year? Is that this year?

[38:39] **Dan Friedman**: This year. This is 2025, the beginning of 2025.

[38:42] **qx()**: We'll see. We'll talk in the Sigmanauts about it.

[38:44] **Dan Friedman**: Let's not talk about it. Let's just fricking go. Let's go. You owe me at least like three trips to IHOP. I'm sure I do. I did you one in a really nasty way one time and that was the first time. That was the first impression is the only impression.

[39:02] **qx()**: That's true. That's true.

[39:04] **Dan Friedman**: Oh, yeah, so you screwed up. But yeah, Alex, let's see if we can do something in Hong Kong. Let's get some new eyes and new faces in the ecosystem.

[39:16] **kushti**: Yeah, so actually we had a meet-up there back in 2019, so we have some, well, old Ergonauts in the town. well some were active in the chats after so one guy Sam was a video operator actually at the meetup and yeah so some other guys and well yeah there was one guy oh but yeah so he's in the town but he didn't attend that meetup but yeah he bought like two Bitcoin's worth of ERG just a few days after the mainnet launch.

[40:03] **kushti**: One guy from one of the biggest VCs actually in the cryptocurrency space. This time I will meet a lot of guys from the biggest Asian VCs to check the temperature in the room. It's a quite interesting time right now, so well at least it's worth to check the temperature.

[40:29] **Dan Friedman**: Are you going QX or are you going to stay at home and not do anything again?

[40:34] **qx()**: It's in Dubai or Hong Kong?

[40:36] **Dan Friedman**: Hong Kong.

[40:38] **qx()**: I'd love to. That'd be amazing.

[40:41] **Dan Friedman**: So let's go. Happening next month.

[40:45] **qx()**: It's tough.

[40:47] **Dan Friedman**: That's not tough. You just buy a plane ticket and go.

[40:52] **kushti**: Talking about things, when you will be in Argentina again, then? Maybe I will come.

[41:01] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah, actually, that would be great if you could come along late March, early April.

[41:06] **kushti**: Oh, let's see. But it's really tough. Yeah, especially around that time. Let's see.

[41:13] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah, we're probably going to go right after, so we're going to go to the US for the World Tea Expo and just myself and Theodore. Business development and then we're going to go to Argentina from there. Before that, I'm going to go to Sri Lanka and lose some weight eating super hot curry.

[41:31] **kushti**: All right, but actually, so in April, I'm planning to visit Japan, actually. But it's closer to late April, and it will be Miyako-jima Islands. And then, yeah, I can visit also Tokyo or, well... You should go Miyako-jima to Osaka.

[41:54] **kushti**: Yeah, Osaka, sure, yeah.

[41:55] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, Miyako-jima. Yeah, yeah, Miyako-jima is nice, yeah.

[42:01] **kushti**: Yeah, so there will be a financial cryptography conference there this year.

[42:06] **kushti**: In Miyako-jima?

[42:08] **kushti**: In Miyako-jima, yeah. So that's an island conference, so you know, well, one year they're organizing a conference somewhere around the Caribbean, and the other year they're organizing it's Well, it's some islands in Asia or Europe. So yeah, it was Malta before and Borneo and now...

[42:27] **kushti**: Oh yeah, remember Malta, that was what, 2016, right?

[42:35] **kushti**: 17, it was April 2017, yeah, beginning of April. And yeah, it was, there were a lot of people there, right? So Charles, so the whole IOHK, I believe. back then. Oh, yeah, yeah. Wait, wait, wait. What I'm talking about. I met you there. Yeah.

[43:02] **Dan Friedman**: So are you talking about just Miyako-jima in Okinawa? Or are you talking about the main? Because there's a lot of Miyako-jimas.

[43:08] **kushti**: Oh, so some islands nearby Taiwan, actually.

[43:13] **Dan Friedman**: Oh, that's Okinawa, yeah. Okay, well, that's about an hour by plane from me, an hour and a half by plane from me, so. All right, so you can... Can't drive to Okinawa, unfortunately, but in April, it's actually probably gonna be really nice. April is already nice and warm over there, so I might actually just gonna come and hang out with you over there, and then we can take a ride back to Osaka.

[43:39] **Dan Friedman**: All right, all right.

[43:40] **qx()**: We got 12 minutes for questions, but before I started those, kushti, while you guys were talking about Japan, I looked up my testnet miner, and I am the single miner, so good news. You want me to stop it? What's the deal there? We'll connect later.

[43:55] **kushti**: No, no, no. So just mine and wait for instructions.

[43:59] **qx()**: Just keep on going. Okay. I'll hold tight. That is me. Good. Okay.

[44:02] **Dan Friedman**: Stop and wait for instructions, QX. Don't be a hero.

[44:06] **qx()**: Only on Ergo can you set something up and forget about it and forget it was you. And then months later, it's like, oh yeah, that's me.

[44:15] **kushti**: All right. So yeah, I will just provide you a 6.0 jar. And yeah, you will need to put, well, one value in a config file. And then, yeah, the rest will be done automatically, like voting and activation. Perfect. And yeah, we will enjoy public testing of 6.0 features in the testnet.

[44:42] **kushti**: Nice.

[44:43] **Dan Friedman**: All right, so let's jump on the questions. Let's start. OK, so here's one. What does Charles think about Rosen Bridge?

[44:50] **Dan Friedman**: So actually, we had quite a few conversations about Rosen Bridge with Charles in the past. He's very interested in it. I mean, it's great tech. Now we are, I mean, we haven't really kind of carried those conversations over any further beyond just the initials, but yeah, he had nothing but good to say about it.

[45:15] **Dan Friedman**: And, you know, it says it's good tech and it's good that it's an ecosystem. So potentially down the road, we can integrate it a little bit more with what IOG is doing maybe do a, you know, Rosen Bridge to midnight, something like that. That would be interesting, I think.

[45:35] **kushti**: Yeah. So recently I watched you guys' video. So you and Charles talked about Rosen Bridge and Charles mentioned that, well, Hydra would be beneficial for Rosen. And yeah, well, It's very true.

[45:57] **kushti**: By its design, Hydra is most beneficial. Hydra is a high-performance layer 2 on Cardano, but it also could be ported to Ergo without the hassle and yeah, it's well, super beneficial for federated protocols like Rosen and Oracle pools actually, right?

[46:22] **kushti**: So for Oracle pools, you may have just one on-chain transaction in case of Gold Oracle pool, for example, right? Instead of 20 per epoch, right? So you can reduce on-chain loads by 20x, right, basically. Well, in an optimistic scenario. So, well, most of the time, basically, like 99.99% of the time, right.

[46:55] **kushti**: And yeah, the same about Rosen. So you can greatly reduce blockchain loads, so reduce fees by using Hydra for Rosen. And yeah, that's actually a super good point. So well, federated protocols such as Rosen and Oracle pools can get well, a lot of boosts without any reduction in security from Hydra.

[47:30] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah, totally. Yeah, we had those good conversations about Hydra. He's actually been talking about Ergo spinning up a Hydra head for quite a while now, so maybe that's something we should look into.

[47:44] **kushti**: Right, yeah. Sounds beneficial, right? And yeah, especially for federated protocols. And we have a few of them already.

[47:56] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah, let's see. Okay, so what do you guys think about the Miners Rights Protocol?

[48:08] **Dan Friedman**: Oh, QX. Are you with us?

[48:11] **qx()**: I'm here, I'm here, I'm awake, I'm alive, I'm alive. So Miners Rights is a protocol of something that was developed in the Sigmanauts mining pool, spearheaded by Mark the Shark, and it's like... Oh, I see, he's like, hey guys, what do you think about... The miners' rights protocol.

[48:32] **qx()**: No, no, no. I have been... So, Sigmanauts mining pool has been running without me for a long time now. Mark the Shark is in full command of this. I don't even mine to it because I'm using my RTX 3090 to mine testnet, kushti. So, I can't even mine to it anymore.

[48:51] **kushti**: What the most? Actually I'm thinking about rewarding testnet miners at some point by building trustless, first trustless pegging right between Ergo mainnet and Ergo testnet and then you can bring testnet ERGs to the mainnet and Well, establish liquidity pool, and then it could be like a sort of meme coin, maybe, right?

[49:23] **qx()**: Oh, that would be interesting. I could also see Mark integrating testnet into the Miners Rights Protocol rewards so that somehow get just in some sort of public database, perhaps, entering your mainnet address into the chain so that it could be read so that you could also be rewarded on mainnet with the Miners Rights Protocol by mining testnet.

[49:47] **qx()**: So yeah, Miners Rights Protocol is like Mark's original idea on steroids. Essentially, it's minting a token to be kind of to designate yourself to a pool, the Sigmanauts pool at this point. And then that gives you mining rights to the pool, which also allows for rewards and bonus tokens and distributions during that mining process.

[50:11] **qx()**: So it's essentially not a commitment protocol, but he's calling it a Miners Rights Protocol. But the PDF is right on the Ergo main web page. I encourage you guys to read it. It's essentially Mark's imagination, Mark's dream child, and it's going to be pretty damn cool.

[50:29] **qx()**: Also, if you go into the weeds, imagine Setting permissions and configs via NFTs minting for your mining instead of going to a website and logging your IP and setting your configs there in case the website goes down. I think about HiveOS. How cool would HiveOS be if you could set your configs for all your rigs in an NFT that you hold in your mining wallet and then that could read the mining wallet as opposed to... Right. What happened to HiveOS six months ago? They lost everybody's configs and burn out some people's cards almost

[51:06] **qx()**: So, stuff like that would be really cool and is possible with the Miners Rights Protocol.

[51:11] **kushti**: Yeah, that sounds interesting.

[51:14] **qx()**: Yeah, yeah. So, check it out. It's way more technical than I'm explaining. I'm just giving a high overview. The PDF's right on the website. Just type in Ergo Miners Rights Protocol. It should be the top result.

[51:25] **kushti**: Yeah, actually good for miners' privacy, right?

[51:28] **qx()**: Exactly, 100%. Yep.

[51:30] **kushti**: Many miners do care about privacy, actually, and that's good.

[51:36] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah Yeah, all right. All right. Let's see. We've got a couple more questions here. oh, has kushti ever tried to play Cyberverse We talked about this.

[51:47] **qx()**: It's a no-go. We want kushti to program. We don't want him to sit and play Cyberverse for 10 hours.

[51:53] **Dan Friedman**: That's a no-go Mr QX the party pooper says it's a no-go

[51:59] **kushti**: All right, so maybe this weekend, yeah, actually, I need to spend the weekend on doing slides for Hong Kong and yeah, well, doing some more writing. So hopefully, well, I need to finish something and then hopefully can open the draft of the Ergo book, I mean the structure.

[52:26] **qx()**: So it's just... You could be like Elon Musk and you can pay me to run the kushti Cyberverse account and I'll run it for you and everybody can think it's you.

[52:36] **Dan Friedman**: Don't pay QX for anything. It's going to go out and buy weird ponchos and dogs. What do we got?

[52:45] **Dan Friedman**: Okay, is there a way to find out how many participants are in the SigmaUSD Oracle pool?

[52:53] **kushti**: SigmaUSD Oracle pool, yeah. So currently it's just about four or five Oracle pools and yeah, you can find them on the blockchain actually, right? So by just tracking transaction and the maximum amount possible now I believe is about like year 12 but yeah only four or five participating because of lack of incentivization and that's why well there is a community now well organized, about launching, version two pool well with, incentivization, right in the form of token like, GARD, but now it would be, I don't know, maybe dollar, oracle for reward token, right.

[53:45] **kushti**: And then, lithium, token would be Lord, So it's lithium oracle reward token.

[54:00] **qx()**: My reward for running SigmaUSD Oracle pool is that kushti talks to me every two weeks to remind me to consolidate my wallet because my Oracle stopped reporting. So that's my reward.

[54:13] **kushti**: Yeah, so that's actually another problem of version one, which is fixed in version two. So there is no dust in version two, right? So currently we are discussing how to update the version one.

[54:30] **kushti**: which is also a bit tricky it seems, but previously we updated a few times version 2 and well, it went smoothly after all, I believe. but it was before Gluon and Dexy, so well, let's see, so now it will be a bit more complicated, I believe.

[54:56] **kushti**: But yeah, it's better to update because, well, we cannot rely on goodwill in the long-term, right, so there is need to have more sound and incentive-compatible protocol. So version 2, And yeah, hopefully there will be more people there. So well, if you are talking about gold pools, so we have maximum number of operators about 20. So yeah, exactly 20 right now, I believe. And yeah, well, online we have currently from 14 to 18, right? So well, good number actually.

[55:43] **qx()**: Once again, Oracle version 2 is like bulletproof, at least from tech running it. I mean, I check on it every couple of months, kushti, and I'm like, oh, yeah, but still reporting, still good.

[55:55] **kushti**: It's just like... Yeah, so... Actually, my Oracle is getting issues, but yeah, they are coming from CoinGecko, so it seems my IP is blocked by CoinGecko. But yeah, it's probably because, well, along with Oracle, I'm running also some other scripts, which are well, fetching data from CoinGecko.

[56:24] **kushti**: So probably, yeah, that's too much for them. So my Oracle, yeah, often only because of CoinGecko not providing data to post on the chain. So, yeah, I need to do something. Let's see.

[56:45] **qx()**: We got a good question at the bottom, Dan.

[56:49] **Dan Friedman**: Is that because it's addressed to you, QX?

[56:53] **qx()**: no i think anybody can answer that honestly i don't know why i think we can all
