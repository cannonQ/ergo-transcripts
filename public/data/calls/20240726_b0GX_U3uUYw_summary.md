# Ergo POW Blockchain Weekly Update & AMA - July 25th 2024

## Executive Summary

This weekly Ergo community call focused heavily on Sigmanauts' revenue generation initiatives and ecosystem development updates. The hosts discussed progress on the Sigmanauts mining pool, which is working toward becoming the first pool to collect storage rent, and outlined multiple revenue streams including SigmaLock (a token locking service), raffle systems, and ephemeral messaging. The call also covered significant community developments including mgPai's addition to the Ergo Foundation and new grant opportunities for marketing and development projects.

Key technical progress was highlighted around Hummingbot integration with Spectrum DEX for arbitrage trading, Keystone hardware wallet integration efforts, and various fiat on-ramp partnerships. The hosts emphasized the need for increased community spending on ecosystem projects to support developers and attract new builders to the platform.

## Key Discussion Points

• **Sigmanauts Mining Pool Updates**: Successfully deployed testnet node for storage rent collection testing, with plans to implement on mainnet soon. Pool offers bonus token rewards from various ecosystem projects.

• **Revenue Stream Development**: Four main initiatives outlined - mining pool profits, SigmaLock token locking service, raffle UI development, and future ephemeral messaging platform.

• **mgPai Joins Ergo Foundation**: Community congratulated mgPai on joining the EF, with discussion of his cross-chain experience benefiting Ergo.

• **New EF Grant Program**: Monthly grants announced with $10k cap for marketing projects, encouraging community proposals for funding.

• **Technical Integrations**: Progress on Hummingbot-Spectrum integration for arbitrage, Keystone hardware wallet support development, and Proton wallet potential integration.

• **Fiat On-Ramp Partnerships**: Discussions with Switch Here and LetsExchange.io for direct ERG purchasing, initially available in Canada/South America.

• **Community Engagement**: Emphasis on encouraging ERG spending on ecosystem projects to support developers and attract new builders.

• **Educational Initiatives**: Cornell blockchain sponsorship and workshop planning to engage students with Ergo development.

## Decisions Made

• Sigmanauts to fund mgPai's Keystone wallet integration work if EF doesn't provide support
• Storage rent collection to be implemented on Sigmanauts mining pool after testnet success
• Proposal planned for mgPai to enhance ErgPy documentation and functionality
• Meeting scheduled with Switch Here fiat on-ramp provider for Monday evaluation
• Cornell blockchain workshops to be developed featuring core Ergo developers

## Notable Quotes

> "One of the big things that I think differs in the Ergo community is that people see their ERG as gold, right? They see it as a store of value that is like really, really hard to get rid of, really hard to spend. So that, I think, in order for us to be successful, we really have to kind of fight that a little bit." - **qx()**

> "It's good to have well-connected people too though, right? So he has programmed and released projects protocols on other chains. I mean, it's that's good. It's good to see cross-chain collaboration thinking." - **CannonQ** (regarding mgPai)

> "These developers need to feel that they are being supported by the ecosystem. That'll then have outsiders look in and say, holy shit, this guy built a project on Ergo and they immediately got, you know, half their tokens sold and being held and the price is sustaining and they're actively building." - **qx()**
