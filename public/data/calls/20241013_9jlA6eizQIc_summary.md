# Ergo Blockchain Community Call Summary

**Date:** October 13, 2024  
**Title:** Dev Update Oct. 13th 2024 | Satergo, Paideia, Celaut, Sigs Mining, Nautilus and more!

## Executive Summary

This community call featured a solo developer update hosted by qx(), focusing on a spotlight of projects in the Ergo ecosystem due to difficulty scheduling guests. The call highlighted significant progress across multiple projects, with particular emphasis on MewFinance's recent successful presale and marketplace launch. MewFinance has created both a DEX (based on stripped-down Spectrum code) and MewMart marketplace, which the Sigmanauts are using for their innovative "FIGITAL" tokens - digital representations of physical merchandise.

The development updates showed strong momentum across the ecosystem, with Ergo Protocol preparing for version 6.0 alpha 2 release, Nautilus wallet implementing zero-conf setup, Paideia SDK nearing completion, and Satergo releasing version 1.80 with major new features including airdrop tools. The call concluded with qx()'s philosophical discussion about building a sustainable, self-reliant economy within the Ergo ecosystem rather than relying on external funding.
