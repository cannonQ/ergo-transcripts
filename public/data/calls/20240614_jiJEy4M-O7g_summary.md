# Ergo Blockchain Community Call Summary
**Date:** June 14, 2024  
**Call Title:** Weekly Update & AMA - June 13th 2024

## Executive Summary

This community call covered major developments in the Ergo ecosystem, including the conclusion of ErgoHack with community voting opportunities through a Paideia DAO, and the upcoming launch of the Rosen Bridge on Friday following successful testing. The discussion featured special guest Sam Lambert from Palmyra Global, who shared updates on partnerships with World Mobile and USDM stablecoin, plus progress on their Winter Protocol for traceability and tokenization.

A significant portion of the call addressed Ergo's identity and positioning in the broader crypto landscape. The speakers emphasized Ergo's role as infrastructure builder focused on "fair money" through proof-of-work, maintaining flat network structures for equal participation, and promoting local agency through open-source development. They contrasted this long-term, principled approach with the short-term speculation and centralized funding models prevalent in much of the crypto space.

## Notable Quotes

**Dan Friedman on Ergo's identity**: "I look at Ergo as US Steel, right? We build infrastructure, right? You're not going to see US Steel bumper stickers on every car and US Steel products in your supermarket, but you damn well know that US Steel is supporting infrastructure of America."

**Armeanio on fair money**: "Cryptocurrencies started to create an alternative to the fiat money printers that exist in the world... Every block in proof of work is based on a fair competition where people have to throw real world resources and every proof of work coin is bought by those resources."

**Sam Lambert on crypto funding problems**: "In crypto, you can put money in, you can get it out in six months. That's absurd... How often does that actually ever happen where you put money in and you can get it out straight away? That's uncommon in non-public markets."
