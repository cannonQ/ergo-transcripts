      "asker": "qx()",
      "answer": "The best and easiest way without borders to get ERG is to convert your electricity into ERG through mining. It's as simple as that - there's no easier way to get ERG than mining it directly with your gaming card or mining rig.",

      "question": "How is Ergo's proof of work different from other blockchains in terms of miner participation?",
      "asker": "qx()",
      "answer": "Ergo's proof of work is different because there's more incentive for miners to make choices and steer the chain. Miners can set small parameters or vote on large parameters that could result in more than a soft fork - even a hard fork. This gives miners more governance participation compared to other proof-of-work chains.",

      "asker": "qx()",
      "answer": "The Sigmanauts mining pool is the first actual mining pool to implement storage rent collection. They extract storage rent into a separate wallet, and then there are votes on Paideia (since it's a mining DAO) to decide what to do with the collected storage rent and how to distribute it. Everyone is an owner and gets a choice on what happens.",

      "asker": "qx()",
      "answer": "The mechanism allows you to mine ERG but get paid in other tokens like Rosen Bitcoin or Rosen ADA. You put a designation in your miner ID string specifying what token you want, and the system extracts that information, runs calculation tables, and pays out in that token via a swap. You can set your threshold and payment request for any Rosen token.",

      "answer": "You can mine ERG (contributing to Ergo's proof-of-work security) but get paid in tokens from proof-of-stake chains like Ethereum or Cardano through the Rosen bridge integration. This allows you to effectively 'mine' proof-of-stake chains while actually securing the Ergo blockchain with your hash power.",

Luivatra is working on fixing an off-chain bug with transaction replaying during syncing, then will bootstrap Live Paideia with zero profit sharing and staking rewards.

It solves current P2P layer problems by being more fault tolerant (improving bridging pace and preventing stuck events) and capable of scaling to a larger guard set, making the bridge more secure and efficient.",
