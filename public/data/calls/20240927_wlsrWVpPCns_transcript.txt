[00:12] **qx()**: Hello, and welcome.

[00:16] **kushti**: Hi, everyone.

[00:18] **qx()**: How are you doing, kushti?

[00:19] **kushti**: How's it going?

[00:21] **kushti**: Doing busy as usually. A lot of coding and actually a lot of excitement also these days.

[00:30] **qx()**: What are you coding? What are you working on?

[00:33] **kushti**: Finally, a lot of things. Crystal clear now. In terms of coding, still 6.0 and sub-blocks also.

[00:45] **qx()**: Have you got any feedback from qx() about 6.0? Because I know he's trying to run it for, he's running Dev 6.0 for Lithos testing, right?

[00:54] **kushti**: Yeah, well, so far no issues reported. Yeah, also preparing some writings about 6.0, so what miners will work on, and actually some soft forking capabilities which will be used in this wording, because they're still not covered well and actually soft forkable capabilities so soft forkability here is made too extreme in comparison with Bitcoin even and so on right so yeah there is need to describe certain things and yeah actually I think well, as there is need to land well, new 1000 developers on Ergo, right, then yeah, maybe from November. After October, we will start some new education initiative.

[02:07] **kushti**: And yeah, before that, we have ErgoHack 9, right? And well, people are already gathering ideas over the ErgoDevelopers group, which you can find over Discord and Telegram, both are bridged. So yeah, it's the single medium. So yeah, please join, there are now around, so doesn't maybe even different ideas expressed and written down. Thanks Michael for studying this or starting writing down the ideas.

[02:47] **qx()**: Are you going to participate in this ErgoHack, kushti?

[02:50] **kushti**: Not sure about that because I will travel around the time. There will be Cardano Summit and a couple of other events. So, not about participation, especially anything serious, but yeah, let's see. But yeah, I've submitted a couple of ideas already. One is about doing some simple anonymous voting tool based on stealth addresses to allow for more anonymous decision making, right? And well, would be useful for DAOs, right? Because well, in many cases, it's not so desirable, right? To show how you want to, well, other participants of the DAO, right? It may cause heated talks and all that stuff. So yeah, with anonymous voting, yeah, it would be much better, right?

[03:58] **qx()**: So at that point you're allowing some sort of relay with a stealth address to identify itself to the owner of it, but not to trace back through to the blockchain essentially. So the stealth address shows that it's voted and we know that that person owns a stealth address. How do you stop multiple votes on those matters? Are you still using an identification token or a participation token?

[04:25] **kushti**: Yeah, so actually, yeah, the idea is super simple. So we just have voting like six deeds before ID at least, right? So you have some addresses, right? One for yes, for example, one for no. Right, and then, yeah, so you send the participation tokens, but now you are sending them not to addresses, but to stealth addresses, right? And yeah, so here, well, the recipient privacy is preserved, right? So well, people are publishing stealth addresses, then some organizer here is sending what's out and then yeah what's there and then yeah you also need to send yeah participation tokens watching tokens and also transaction fee right to the stealth address and then yeah well with just one input transaction so you are sending from this stealth address stealth contract protected outputs to whether yes or no outcome right and yes you are using only one input then and yeah you are not paying fee from any other input then yeah well it's no privacy leak right because of the need to pay fees, right? Because well, it's the issue in many privacy protocols, especially for account-based cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum. In many cases, it's possible to find privacy tooling users because of fees being paid from ordinary addresses.

[06:41] **kushti**: Another idea is to make at least a sketch of yeah, the old idea of mine actually expressed on the forum, so some wallet which is hiding all the crypto complexities, right? So you just have magic internet gold there, right? And then under the hood, yeah, you've got Gluon, for example, and Babel fees, right, to pay fees, but yeah, the wallet is hiding all those complexities. And yeah well actually for instant payments it could be also layer two friendly and then yeah in the wallet you just have like holding accounts right and the instant payments accounts and yeah you transfer from one to another, which is using layer 1 and layer 2 under the hoods, but you don't know about that. The idea is to hide all the complexities and make some wallets useful for people which are far away from crypto, yeah living in Africa for example right so they know what gold is but yeah not all this crypto layer one or all that crypto language right it's kind of alien language yeah so that's another idea.

[08:22] **qx()**: Do you think it's important to... No, like I understand the importance of anonymous voting 100%. I mean, you can kind of do that in Paideia if you start off with a fresh wallet, I guess, right? And you never bind it to yourself, identify it to yourself on the platform. But what about the initial part of a token access distribution. How do you feel about, do you feel that there should be known entities that are being distributed to? I mean, your tool is of course going to be open and your protocol is going to be open there for anybody to do, so it could start either way. You could start with a group of anonymous people that are doing anonymous voting, but do you feel it's more important to start with a group of known people and then the voting that those known people do is anonymous?

[09:06] **kushti**: Yeah, so I think the long-hanging fruit is known people, right, at least. Because well, if you have unknown people... Could be kushti account one, kushti account two, kushti account three. Yeah, it could be 99% kushti accounts, right. 1% so yeah there are lots of hard problems here like how to exclude civil accounts all that stuff so yeah it's not that easy.

[09:48] **kushti**: And yeah well and as usually well there is need for developers so Bruno is still looking for developers now for even two ideas well of decentralized finance and digital finance and more yeah so well please join if you develop and here please well, I spread the word, right, to developers and not only about Ergo. And yeah, I think it's kind of a decisive moment in general, right? So to define well, the Ergo movement. So well, there are different entities here, right, like Sigmanauts, so Ergo Foundation, Ergo Devs DAO, and Ergo one, right, and other entities. But yeah, well, the missing part, I think, is to well, define the Ergo movement, right, centered around the ideas from the manifesto, Ergo manifesto, right, and similar documents done by other people maybe and so on so yeah maybe there is need even for discussions around that so like philosophical chats and so on and yeah by the way about chat so next week I think maybe it's better to skip the AMA because at the same time we will have Twitter spaces with Nervos folks.

[11:42] **kushti**: Yeah, also a bit philosophical. It would be about peer-to-peer economy, blockchain powered peer-to-peer economy. Yeah, well, the announcements will be done, right? So it's still not done, I believe.

[12:06] **qx()**: Yeah, it should be anytime soon. I just got a message from one of the Nervos guys saying that Jordan's going to reach out and walk through the group. So yep, we should be able to dual plan some sort of announcements for that space between our account and the Nervos account and hopefully get a good discussion going there between you guys. So that should be fun.

[12:28] **kushti**: Yeah. So let's do that today. And then yeah, so next week there will be no AMA, only Twitter spaces, because it's coming on the same time, right? It's 1 p.m. probably, I believe. Right? Yeah. Yeah, so this time it's yeah, 1 p.m. even, because Nervos folks are in China.

[13:01] **kushti**: Yeah, so yeah, then the next Thursday we have spaces on peer-to-peer blockchain powered economy with Nervos and then yeah, well, I would like to propose to also think about Ergo movement, right, centered around Ergo manifesto and willing to deliver peer-to-peer financial tools right and well better forms of money to serve our needs of those interactions to all the people right to broader masses because well it is possible to expand at this point I believe there is enough tooling already right and more tooling is coming.

[13:57] **kushti**: All right, so what's on you on your side?

[14:00] **qx()**: On my side? Let's see, a couple of cool things. I've developed the, what's it called, I wrote a proposal to the fiat onramp place that I was talking to, went back to that wrote a proposal for those of you that don't remember they came back with a price for listing on their onramp it was a little high so there's negotiations there that need to take place but I let them know that I was going to come back with a proposal and the proposal that I sent them was essentially hey, you know, if we're going to integrate and pay money for a Fiat OnRamp that should have US access by the end of the year, they said. So we'll see what the progress is on that. But I'd like you to integrate Ergo native tokens as well. Sorry. I'm so used to saying CNTs. Ergo native tokens. Dan, I was looking at you. That's why. Ergo native tokens into the Fiat OnRamp as well. So that means using Spectrum DEX smart contracts. So the idea would be you'd go to the Fiat OnRamp, you'd choose ERG or you'd choose CYPX or Rosen or you'd choose SigmaUSD. And once you selected that, you'd hit buy. And what the on-ramp would be doing in the back end is you'd actually be buying from their pool of ERG with Fiat, however that is. And then they would then go to the smart contracts and swap your ERG for SigmaUSD or Rosen or whatever, and then you'd get whatever that token that you chose is. So it's in coding terms, it's not that difficult to do. It's just whether they are willing to do it. So I propose that to them. We'll see what they say. Hopefully they are thirsty for some Treasury funds or some community funds to help that on there. But first they have to answer their question about progress on us listings because the last thing we need is another gosh darn listing that's not in the US. That's for sure.

[16:22] **qx()**: So we'll see how that goes. Second thing is we've, last week I built an API and teamed up with MewFinance because Unreal is busy with Gluon Gold with that raffle that finished but auction house will be next but teamed up with MewFinance and Aco and HQx and the trick that we had to do is we were trying to sell, they call them physicals. We're trying to sell NFTs on their marketplace that link to an actual real world asset. So the idea is you come to the marketplace, you see that make mining great again hat. Do you have that hat? Dan, you got that hat? I saw your video wearing it yesterday. Is it at the office?

[16:44] **Dan Friedman**: It's at the office. Anybody who, I said, I said, it's, I left it at that. I try to keep my, I try to keep the off, I try to keep a lot of, you know, like Ergo theme at the office. I still have the scrolls from what last year that you printed out for Ergo. We got, but we'll be hanging those up on the new office and I put the hat over there. I got the Ergo sweater. Yeah. So yeah, that's in the office, but she gave me another one. I was like, and I want for the house.

[17:18] **qx()**: All right, perfect. So the trouble was we had to get somebody to, each is a singleton. So the NFT is actually crafted just for a one-to-one item that's here. We're not crafting like a hundred hat tokens. We're actually crafting a token for each physical item. So when you buy the NFT, that's the only NFT. It says make mining great again hat number one number two number three. So everything's unique. And the trick was getting your address. So I know you probably maybe don't want to store them on MewFinance or on auction house centrally. So I created an API with posts and git commands for Aco and HQx. And so when you check out one of those NFTs, it will then pop up a form and that is directly posted to our API, the SigmaLots API, which will be pruned after shipping arrives. So we will prune those, not keep that data there, so you don't have to worry about that. And then we'll also post some information there, some relay services as well that people can use so that you get a virtual mailbox, the product goes to that mailbox, and then they take a picture of it and you say, okay, I want it shipped to me or throw it out or whatnot. So those services exist too, you can take care of those on your own. But we've got the other one set up now. And Aco just did some tests of the database last night, and I should be able to post a couple things later today. So look for some physical swag on MewFinance, courtesy of hard work from Aco and HQx. And we'll probably post five or six things five or six hats five or six shirts five or six sticker packs five or six Sweatshirts, so you should see about 20 30 items pop up on there. For I haven't decided if we're gonna do SigmaUSD or ERG yet. We're probably gonna ask for SigmaUSD just because you know the market conditions they are with things going up and down. People will snipe our NFTs and get some cheap swag if something happens so I think they call that war that starts with a V and ends with volatility.

[19:36] **kushti**: Yeah something like that Dan. What about possibility to play with Gold possible?

[19:39] **qx()**: I think you can do that on MewFinance. I think MewFinance has a white listed token, so we could. That's a good point, kushti. So we could do half the hats in SigmaUSD, half the hats in Gold. HQx, I think, is watching right now. He can comment if he takes Gluon Gold at his site, but I think he does.

[19:57] **qx()**: And do you have global delivery? That's the idea. So the idea is so the way the process works. All the information is on each individual NFT. So HQx says you can add Gold as payment. Okay, good. So the idea is that you buy the NFT you check it out. The NFT has a Sigmanauts telegram account on it with two-factor authentication. So you then reach out to the Sigmanauts telegram account. You can do it from an anonymous address. It doesn't matter. You prove that you are essentially who you are by us taking your address calculating a shipping price and you paying from the address that you bought the NFT with that shipping amount so then we know it's you and then we ship it out so yep we'll ship we'll ship anywhere as long as you as long as you pay the shipping fee yep all right nice so so that's that.

[20:50] **qx()**: Lastly, Riva from Cornell Blockchain has asked if I'll come in and talk to the blockchain group, which is great, what I was expecting this semester. And I'm going to also use that opportunity to try to, I think it's October 2nd or 3rd or 4th, I'm going to use that opportunity to let them know about ErgoHack and how it's a UI-based, UX-based ErgoHack and let them know how many back-end devs in the dev channel are waiting for a UI designer to come in and team up with them to do something with that. So hopefully maybe we can get a few students to team up in the dev chat with some people joining ErgoHack. I think that'll be fun. Yeah, I couldn't make it to the DAO meeting yesterday to talk to the kids about the Cornell DAO. My wife is sick and I can't tell if I have COVID or not. So we'll hit the next one. But should get that started soon, too. So lots of stuff going on lots of excitement always Ergo. Dan the man with a plan.

[21:54] **Dan Friedman**: All right. All right. Sounds like you've got everything, including COVID.

[21:58] **qx()**: I know, right? Everything.

[22:00] **Dan Friedman**: Congratulations on that. I guess. Yeah. Don't cough on me even by proxy also, you know, I did dedicate my hat's turn to you earlier. Yeah, that's it. Yeah. I know it's, you got this thing about wearing hats the right way, but anyway, right. So quite a bit actually happening from our end. So we're well, as you all, I hope you all know by now that Palmyra runs on Ergo and particularly on Winter Protocol that runs on Ergo and so we've actually been working on expanding well basic not just not really expanding functionality but I guess expanding the logistics of the protocol to accommodate different types of sales. And so we're actually getting ready for several campaigns right now that would increase the transaction volume significantly on the platform. And so we needed to be ready with the right type of events, because what happens with Winter Protocol, it creates events, different events for different parts of the traceability and the provenance solution and so essentially what and and we had some questions about what the token does and again these are I mean and at their core they're Ergo NFTs that we're using and so we had some questions from the community about is there a token? Is there not a token? Because tokenization in its, I guess, the blockchain popular culture definition is tokenized assets, meaning like you tokenize gold, right? And you have fractional ownership of the gold and you have these tokens that represent an X amount of gold, and then you list those tokens, and then people can buy part of the gold. And then each token has got an equal, say, gold reserve somewhere in a vault. So that's the traditional way. Or the most common way to tokenize.

[24:25] **Dan Friedman**: What we do with Palmyra and with Winter Protocol is tokenize provenance. And so the NFT that represents the lot, the Ergo NFT that represents the lot that is tokenized is actually its own value chest. So basically this is information that moves along with the commodity that is tokenized, that it is attached to, and it holds provenance for that commodity, which is actually very important for well, for the commodity itself, for the value of the commodity itself. The same thing goes even when you, say, tokenize gold. So with gold or with other metals, when you tokenize it, yeah, you can have a reserve somewhere that you tokenize, and then you make fractions of that reserve. The problem with that is, and this is actually not a Web 3 problem exclusively, but this is a problem with commodities trading, is that there will be times when you will have a token or you will have a contract, a futures contract, if we're talking about legacy trading, but the actual reserve is not going to be there. And so this is where provenance tokenization is so important because a provenance tokenization, one of the things is proof of reserve, right? So you have a way to prove that the reserve actually exists. And so that means coupling your tokenization with IoT devices, which is what we're also working on right now. I mean, different methods of proving that this gold really exists. This gold is in the vault or whatever other commodity, whether it's tea, whether it's honey, whether it's precious stones, whatever it is, it's there. So that's very important. And that is really what we're focusing on right now. So this is how we're kind of starting to really nuance Winter Protocol to accommodate that.

[26:38] **Dan Friedman**: So we're really excited about that because I think that, well, first of all, it'll bring a lot more transactions on the platform. Right now, our transactions are mostly from B2B sales. And what we're working on right now is different types of, you know, a different type of a sales structure where we'll have more a wider customer base that can join and participate in the sales. So eventually, you know, and plus we have a campaign that we're going to be starting really soon that will bring on a lot more users as well. So again, you know, what does that mean for Ergo? It means more transactions on Ergo. And that's I think that's what we want. Right. Want more transactions on Ergo? That's the idea, right?

[27:31] **qx()**: Oh, yeah. We love transactions.

[27:34] **Dan Friedman**: So that's basically what we've been working on at its core is getting more transactions, more transactions on Ergo and really kind of, you know, making all these things more business viable because I mean, then in the end, I think that is what is going to that's what's going to put Ergo into more of the part of the mainstream that we're looking to be a part of. Like I said, I think that Ergo has a huge potential of being the engine for many, many things, like for example, what's happening with Rosen right now where Ergo is the engine. And I think that's super important, you know, and I think that and I know a lot of people do want to have that, you know, the more of the cool, you know, the cool web three kids table kind of appeal, you know, it's like, oh, yeah, we have a bazillion gazillion community members and a million, you know, meme coins that pump to whatever. And, you know, we have a hundred bajillion dollars locked in DeFi that actually does nothing, but, you know, it's TVL. I think it's more meaningful for Ergo to be, to be the engine, you know, for Ergo to be powering things like Rosen, things like Palmyra, things that are actually, or tools that are actually meant for mainstream and cross chain utility, which is where, you know, which where the future is, I think.

[29:07] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah, and so, I mean, aside from that, there's some action, there's some things happening with Rosen Bridge. We are going to be expanding to accommodate other ecosystems with Rosen Bridge, or Rosen Bridge is going to be expanding. We're going to be assisting them in doing so. And yeah, so I'm just really looking forward to being able to kind of, like I said, just to do what really, look, what, one of the reasons why I decided to start Palmyra as a business on Ergo is I felt that we needed a business on Ergo. Like that, that's basically was, you know, the deal. We needed a commercially viable business on Ergo that will bring organic transactions onto the platform. And I think that we are at the cusp of that right now to be able to bring real steady volume of viable transactions on chain and to really kind of give it the you know, give it its, you know, see what it can do, what it can really do. So yeah, very excited about that. And yeah, that's it from my end. And by the way, qx(), you know, if you turn a certain way, your microphone kind of looks like a Texas goatee, you know, just, yeah, like that. It's very, it's very hillbilly of you.

[30:44] **qx()**: Thank you, sir.

[30:45] **Dan Friedman**: Oh, don't forget. Rockabilly. That's very rockabilly of you.

[30:48] **qx()**: Don't forget guys, Rosen called out yesterday for a final round of Ethereum testing. They need 30 plus people. Any community member can participate in the test. It's going to be up in about two days or so, which two days Rosen time probably next week. So please jump on that and help them test those transfers with Ethereum and the test network. And I heard through the grapevine that your reward will be a personalized video from CW singing some sort of Australian traditional song to you. So that's something that I'm going to do just for that. That'll be fun.

[31:30] **Dan Friedman**: Let it be Men at Work. Let it be Men at Work. It has to be, it has to be Men at Work. Come on. It'd be like the most cliche thing ever.

[31:39] **qx()**: Perfect.

[31:41] **Dan Friedman**: CW, if you're going to do it, do it Men at Work. And do the drums yourself, you know, like whatever they do thing. Okay, do it. And do it while you're while you're dressed like Mad Max. Okay. And with a dog and a shotgun, there we go. That's my image of real Australia.

[32:03] **qx()**: Let's see what he says. He's going to DM me. Tell me to go F spiders or something. Okay. Here is a question for you, Dan. Let's start off strong. HQx says he was reading Dan- I don't believe HQx reads, so that's a lie. But anyway, HQx was reading Dan talking about commodities in Rosen. What are his thoughts on trading commodities on MewFinance, like SellT for Gold, ERG, Rosen-ADA, any other native token? Maybe.

[32:31] **Dan Friedman**: So that's actually a very interesting proposition. We are currently looking at different ways to expand payments and not just for commodities, for other things that we're going to be putting on chain like the Palmyra Endeavor platform, the one that we're actually going to be going to be tokenizing lithium and other endeavors on for lack of a better word. And so in that case, yeah, I would like to have different ways of kind of trading things, right? So being able to accept payments as long as these payments can be hedged against something, right? Because I mean, for the same reason why you would rather accept SigmaUSD and not just straight up ERG for payments. And don't get me wrong, obviously, I say the same thing about pretty much any other crypto. Right now, crypto is not viable for payments. Why? It's not because the technology, it's because the volatility. It's because you don't want to have all of your payments in something that can go up or down 20%. It's like people don't like that when that happens to everyday cash. Eventually, we will have a way to have just a marketization and a hedging so that the currency, as it expands, just like with any currency, the bigger it gets, the more complex the ecosystem gets, the more stable it becomes in many ways if the ecosystem grows organically and healthily, where the volatility starts to diminish naturally. But right now, even with Bitcoin, I don't like paying with Bitcoin. I just don't like it, even though Bitcoin doesn't really move as much as it did even five, six years ago. Not as often at least.

[34:38] **kushti**: Yeah, so actually, I saw numbers like two years ago, but now Bitcoin is even more volatile. And so numbers actually shown that average daily volatility in Bitcoin is so yeah back in 2022 is basically the same as back in 2013 right so well the volatility is not going away and I think it won't go away so cryptocurrencies would be volatile pretty much always. So yeah, there is nothing better, I think, in using derivative tools like Gluon or SigmaUSD if they are trustless, right? So trustless derivatives are good for payments and why not? So you have the core money, so commodity money, backed by energy bonds in the computational network, which is quite good backing, well, to me at least. But then yeah, it's quite natural to have more stable layer on top of, and yeah, pretty trustless, right? So trustless derivative tools like Gluon and SigmaUSD, but even that is not enough, right? So if you are going for the real world, then yeah, these tools are not enough, right? So you also need for monetary expansion. And that's where you need for tokenized real world tests probably, right? To mix them with trustless options and to have monetary expansion, right? Upper level so yeah that's pretty much like money are structured in the real world also right where you have different layers of money and that's pretty much okay so there is no need to wait when cryptocurrencies will become stable.

[36:50] **Dan Friedman**: Absolutely. I mean, I'm not saying we should wait. I'm just saying that, yeah, exactly what you're saying. We should be able, and I will be, and we will be as a business utilizing tools that can mitigate volatility so that we can bring in more users that just don't have the risk appetite for volatile assets, because I mean yeah of course you can bring on people that will want to get paid in ERG right or or they you know it there is obviously a market for that the same with ADA you know there's people that want to get paid in ADA. Most of the time they actually don't want to pay ADA or don't want to get paid in ADA. And that's actually something that the Japanese community kind of had to go through. There was one member of the Japanese community that created a traceable umeshu, which is the plum wine, you know, the wine where they put, it's a sweet wine with the plum inside. And it's really nice, right? The wine is nice. He made it, he got it from some prefecture that specialized in, it's just like premium stuff. And he thought that he would be able to sell it to the Japanese community out here just because it's tokenized, kind of. I mean, it's got a traceability. It's not tokenized, but it's got a traceability solution attached to it. It's within the ADA community. He's a known community member. And what basically happened was people wanted the product, but they didn't want to pay ADA for it. You know, because they just don't want to do it. You know, they want to hold on to it, the same with ERG. You know, people want to hold on to it because of the opportunity cost, right? So, okay, I pay for this with ERG right now, but I believe that ERG is gonna do like exponential things and, you know, ERG to dollar value or whatnot. And then I'll lose out on the opportunity if I, you know, and if there's also other options, like, okay, but if I can pay with SigmaUSD, because SigmaUSD is gonna be SigmaUSD. That's his job to be SigmaUSD all the time in a stable way. The world will all pay with SigmaUSD. So yeah, yeah, I think, well, to get back to the question, yes, I think it's a very viable thing to trade commodities on MewFinance and do it for Gold, do it for, you know, Rosen assets, as long as they can be hedged against volatility. And that's it.

[39:43] **kushti**: I think there are actually many ways to break physical and digital has to go. So once I made a forum post on Ergo forum about doing blockchain insurance for gold, right? So for example, I can buy a brick of gold in Thailand, you are tokenizing fake gold, for example. But then if I cannot reach the world because of COVID or whatever, I can get within a certain time frame insurance in Gluon. So basically the same amount of gold but in blockchain form. And yeah, I mean, I think such options are probably more natural here, right? So when it's not possible to get physical assets, then yeah, let's blockchain assets be in play via insurance or other financial instruments.

[40:53] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah, so with insurance as well, I think that is very good. And it's also good because you can have, it's a lot easier to have subsets with blockchain insurance, I think. I mean, you could create subsets a lot easier, basically, it's just different types of, you know, formulas, how do you, how do you assess these different things and just put them on, put them on chain and then let them do their thing. Like what you said about Thai gold. So if it is, and I know about gold because I do deal with commodities. So this is where this is coming from. It's not just some random knowledge. But we actually did a pilot, sort of first pilot that we did for Palmyra was with a Thai gold company called Osiris. It's one of the largest companies in Thailand for specifically Thai gold. And specifically Thai gold has a different purity than LBMA gold, which is the international standard, which is 99.9% pure, which is because there is no such thing as 100% pure gold. But Thai gold has got its own purity of 96.5%. So Thai gold is actually an alloy. And most of the time it is smelted with copper or silver. And so, and there's a big market for this as well, right? So there's people invest in this the same way they invest in regular gold. So they have fractional ownership, they have tokenization of this. In fact, Osiris has these tools and you can actually invest in Osiris Thai gold. But the reason why I'm bringing this up is because there are, even with gold, there are different subsets, right? And you might want to invest in Thai gold versus LBMA gold. And so you want to be able to ensure Thai gold, right? And have a way to ensure Thai gold. And I think with on-chain insurance, at least it would be my feeling that that would actually be a subset that can be much, it could be accommodated much easier because it'll be just part of the wider algorithm. So yeah, I mean, I really strongly think that that is a good way to, again, hedge against risk, like what you said, and accommodate wider spectrums of available investments.

[43:25] **qx()**: We have a question for kushti. kushti, could you talk more about how Sigma chains could attract miners from other coins, including ASICs to Ergo pools? What's the incentive for something like a sidechain that's mining with ASIC or something like that? What's the incentive to come over and mine that?

[43:48] **kushti**: Okay, so we are starting answering questions, right? We're already doing that. So we had some discussion about tokenization, all that stuff, which is enjoyable. So yeah, concluding a bit before answering the questions. So yeah, maybe it's worth to do spaces on tokenization and how to bring real world assets to Ergo. Then what do you think about it? Maybe in somewhat mid-October?

[44:19] **Dan Friedman**: An Ergo summit in mid-October?

[44:21] **kushti**: No, no, no, just Twitter spaces maybe about yeah, all that stuff because yeah, that's enjoyable.

[44:28] **Dan Friedman**: Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, absolutely. I'm actually in October, I will be in Argentina talking about tokenizing lithium. So that would actually be a nice place to do Twitter spaces, you know, kind of like from boots on the ground. Yeah. Yeah. So let, let, let's make it happen. But listen, you know, I, I think I, I heard, I thought I heard Ergo summit. When, when, when are we going to do that? We should do an Ergo summit.

[44:58] **kushti**: Yeah. So, but, it's the question to qx() probably. So yeah, I think that could be one after the ErgoHack, right? But yeah, I don't really know about, I think that's the best.

[45:09] **qx()**: Yeah. I think that's the best timing.

[45:11] **kushti**: Yep. Yep. Yeah. That means somewhat like early November, mid-November?

[45:18] **kushti**: Early November, mid-November. But we can have just spaces before. So it's the most relaxed format. And then we can prepare for something bigger.

[45:31] **Dan Friedman**: I know you guys with the exception of qx() and Mark the Shark and a couple other people don't really like to get out too much. You know you guys kind of what do they call them like a shut-in? Yeah, I think qx() is like a reform shut-in.

[45:50] **qx()**: I think so I have to charge my social battery up.

[45:53] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's like all right. All right qx() What's our EQ doing today? Is it high or is it low? Are we live or are we slow? Anyway, yeah, let's make it happen. I've been yearning for another nice Ergo summit slash event in person. I know we can do it online. Yes. Don't worry. You know, don't, don't worry your bros. We, you know, you don't have to, you don't have to get out of your house if you don't want to. You don't have to get that, you know, natural vitamin D if you don't want to, but I would also like to see what we did in, was it 21, 22, in Austin. That was a nice meetup. We did good, I think, on that one. That was memorable. And I think we onboarded many new Sigmanauts from that meetup. And I think we should do another one. We'll do one. We'll do one in Dubai, or we'll do one somewhere. All right. Maybe even in Asia. Maybe even in Asia. We can do one in Asia.

[47:00] **kushti**: Yeah, we can do another one in Dubai around late October, because yeah a lot of people will be in town. So then yeah about Sigma chains right so the idea is that every sidechain has own token right to attract miners. And yeah, it also could be dedicated mining, right? So it could be merge mined, then yeah, Ergo miners are getting those tokens for mining sidechain along the main chain. But yeah, it also could be dedicated mining, means dedicated chain, but also with trustless sidechaining two way back. And then yeah, it could be about some ASIC-friendly algorithm, right? Well, CPU-oriented, so whatever, like RandomX, well, K-heavy hash, Blake tree, whatever, right.

[48:12] **qx()**: Could you combine, could you combine Sigma chains with a permission based mining approach to be integrated into communities and LETS systems? So let's say we have a small community and you know, they're utilizing ChainCash as a form of trust to pass notes between each other and even outside of the community with that but they also want a base layer that's trusted that it's always going to be mined that there's always a security layer no matter what. So essentially, there's a Sigma chain that's made to be mineable by CPUs, right? So we're going to have a low barrier of entry for maybe a third world country or something. And there's token distribution to allow only certain people that are trusted to mine in that community. So you always have a trust that maybe it's voted on that are mining this sidechain with a CPU that are then potentially backing up ChainCash notes. So you have that trust that, hey, this community is trusted for their ChainCash notes, and they're also actively involved in mining this chain that then, you know, distributes those ChainCash notes. Is that something that's possible?

[49:23] **kushti**: Yeah, I think possible, but yeah, so if it's permission, then yeah, how do you update that? You have to fork something, right? Yeah, yeah. You need for some rules, maybe that's possible, I need to think. For CPU mining in regards with that, usually it's considered as the most ordinary people oriented option, but if it's permissionless, then usually it's dominated. CPU mining is dominated by botnets, right?

[50:09] **qx()**: Yeah, correct. So that would be the issue. Yeah.

[50:12] **kushti**: Unfortunately, but if it's permissions, then yeah, it's possible to make some additional conditions on mining.

[50:25] **qx()**: Yeah, I just think it'd be neat to have a community that's doing a system of local trade and creating notes based on their own reserves perhaps and then not only they're doing that but they're also backing up the security of those notes with a blockchain that they're actively mining and doing and using so I just maybe it's too early to have those thoughts.

[50:54] **kushti**: But then it could be not the proof of work even, right, some other consensus. But yeah, I need to think. But yeah, actually, it could be, I don't know, just somewhat like layer two. So I actually thinking about maybe doing even layer two systems, reusing Rosen peer-to-peer network, right? And so then Rosen watchers can also watch our layer two state, right? But yeah, it's too early to describe the details here. Definitely.

[51:44] **kushti**: But yeah, about questions. Yeah, let me also check them. But yeah, first note. I'm the guy who bought a mining creek and can't get it to run low. I will do it no matter what. Yeah, that's the... Yeah, I said I did. So I believe, actually, it's the best option to buy ERG right via mining. So yeah, it's permissionless, anonymous, and yeah, well, it's unstoppable. So you can always get ERG right via mining. And yeah, it's also beautiful, right, when you have some mining rig at home. So basically, printing money at home. Yep.

[52:37] **qx()**: I don't think people get that as much or have that, you know, every once in a while you'll see somebody get that realization that they're in control of the creation of their own spendable or usable coin or token. Super cool.

[52:57] **kushti**: Yeah, is BitGet listing in the works? But yeah, I don't really know so that they will, I don't know...

[53:07] **qx()**: Last thing I heard today is that they are, what's it called, they still need to do some more testing. They're testing it still. So that's the last thing that came across my plate.

[53:21] **kushti**: Okay, because yeah, I don't know much about that. Well, a site of folks represented themselves as BitGet guys in the dev chat, but yeah, everyone can do that, right? So yeah, hard to say anything.

[53:43] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah, you'd be amazed how many times just a random Binance executive pings me on telegram and tells me that they're very impressed with our Ergo coin and they would like to list it on Binance.

[53:59] **qx()**: Oh, that's a good one. Is it funny?

[54:01] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah.

[54:02] **qx()**: Yeah, this guy actually popped code in though and was asking for a suggestion. So I think there's some legitimacy to it. Yes.

[54:14] **Dan Friedman**: Exactly. Exactly. All right. Well, listen, all right, it's 10:04.

[54:19] **qx()**: kushti and I are going to go, but Dan, since you were 10 minutes late, you have to stay and do the last 10 minutes.

[54:24] **Dan Friedman**: Well, no, I understand that you were 10 minutes late, so... All right, so let's spend five minutes more on questions.

[54:34] **kushti**: Do we have any more questions?

[54:36] **qx()**: We got a question from Mark at the bottom. A lot more, but yeah, let's go one by one.

[54:43] **kushti**: Why did EIF members start following Kraken Pro on X today? What is this about and what is the question about? Some EF members started to follow Kraken.

[54:59] **Dan Friedman**: Because they like following Kraken on X. It's like, you know, there is no, there is no hexagonal conspiracy here or things that you don't know.

[55:08] **kushti**: We can imagine very different options.

[55:14] **Dan Friedman**: I think people are just trying to put the pieces together. There's actually a question here from Mark the Shark. What would it take to set up a Sigma chain and a new mining setup on that chain?

[55:35] **kushti**: Oh, so currently there is no easy-to-use framework, unfortunately, so you need to fork the Ergo code or just use Sigma or Sigma Rust and write a blockchain around that blockchain logic. But yeah, so I think after 6.0 and sub-blocks, yeah, it would be a good time to work on that. So to have some framework like substrate. And yeah, like Scorex, which I did a long before, substrate and all that stuff. Yes, correct. So yeah, it was framework for modular blockchain framework, which I did back in 2015-16. And yeah, there were even some few production blockchains built on top of that, including Ergo. And yeah, some more blockchains.

[56:48] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah, I remember reading that stuff back in 2016.

[56:52] **kushti**: Yeah, like, I don't know, maybe like five blockchains, so like that's...

[57:01] **qx()**: I can't wait till Rusty creates a one-click phone install of a Sigma chain. So you just download an app, click a button, and you just spun up a Sigma chain and you're mining to it. That's your challenge, Rusty. When kushti comes out with a Sigma chain framework, one-click Sigma chain.

[57:19] **kushti**: Yeah, that would be good. So I think still there is still a shortage of goods collateral here, right? Well, in regards with, well, goods commodity currencies like, well, proof of work cryptocurrencies well with trustless derivatives right and then yeah also well real world assets with non-trust assumptions right which you can use them all together in order to produce well, high level money aggregates basically, right? So to expand, because yeah, there is a big shortage of money, especially in certain areas around the globe, such as Africa and so on. Oh, I forgot to mention, especially good money.

[58:26] **qx()**: I forgot to mention, officially, I think the bear market is almost over for all season because our beloved JennyD is back in chats. And as a welcoming gift to JennyD, I have given her delegation control of the Sigmanauts Twitter and asked her to start posting from it. So you should see some uptick in Sigmanauts Twitter posts. And those are from JennyD. So if you guys don't know Jenny, go ahead and follow her on Twitter. It's ergo mergoadergo is her handle. And hopefully she'll start blowing up Twitter soon with her spicy stuff.

[59:05] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah, because I was going to say qx(), you know, you, you've been doing the opposite of blowing up Twitter. You were imploding Twitter with the qx() account. I'm like, or the, the, the, the Sigmanauts account. I'm like, what the hell happened to that guy? What is he doing?

[59:22] **qx()**: I can't, I have limits, sir. I'm not kushti. I do have limits.

[59:26] **Dan Friedman**: Your limits are very, very limited because I was just thinking about that. What happened to the Sigmanauts account? They used to like all of my shit posting and now I didn't just get no support, get no support from the Sigmanauts. Where is that guy that can't wear a hat straight? What happened to him?

[59:42] **qx()**: Jenny, I'll tell Jenny that she's got to like all your posts, even all of them, all of them, even the few good ones you have.

[59:49] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah, they're all good. They're just different levels of good. Yeah.

[59:55] **kushti**: All right.

[59:55] **qx()**: It's 10:09. Are we done, kushti? Any more questions?

[59:58] **kushti**: Let's answer one more. So yeah, one funny question. And yeah, then there are a few unanswered, but yeah, next time. Sorry, folks. There are actually two questions. Let's choose one. Yes, so I can choose it. Next time. So yeah, I love how you guys are all having fun despite the price. Why do we think more people are not on board with Ergo? Oh, but what does it mean? All right, so basically the question is how is it possible to have fun despite the price? And why people not on board with Ergo so so well in regards with onboarding I actually see well another wave already coming well especially in some national groups like Russian for example there is quite solid growth recently and yeah it's not about bots right so well number of online users and so on. So yeah, need to check Twitter and so on. But yeah, well, people actually come in and then the question is, well, how can we do fun? But yeah, you know, if we would stay depressive, right, because of price, then how that would help in onboarding people. Right, I mean, if the question is about, I mean, if the question is proposing implicitly or not, so even to onboard people with depressing attitudes because of pricing, then yeah, it doesn't work, sorry. So yeah, well, you need to do basically the same during the spiking pricing, right, during the dips, because yeah, well, if your mission and well, the movement is depending on price, it's not quite strong, right, mission and movement in the first place. So yeah, the dependence on externalities, well, there is need to do the same. Yeah, that's my point.

[62:56] **kushti**: Do you guys have to add anything?

[63:00] **Dan Friedman**: Well, I just say, you know, maybe maybe the new angle could be the way, you know Ergo, we're the depressed blockchain. You know, misery loves company join Ergo. We can do that we can what do you think qx()?

[63:17] **qx()**: I think yeah, I think you'll find that the people in Ergo right now are here for reasons that they're fulfilled by seeing everyday progress of Ergo so things like kushti talking about Sigma chains or Gluon Gold launching or MewFinance doing digital physical items for sale I think if you're here for the reasons of building and Ergo then you're gonna have fun every fucking day like every time every dev update every AMA you're gonna be like oh shit that's cool or you know that kind of stuff. So that's how it's easy to be fun in the Ergo ecosystem despite whatever price is happening just in Ergo or in the entire ecosystem.

[64:01] **Dan Friedman**: There hasn't been one update where anybody that was on our AMA, whether I am on them or not, we're, you know, we're just, we're like sitting around. So what happened today? What happened this week? Yeah, nothing. We're just, we're just messing around.

[64:16] **qx()**: I know. Right.

[64:16] **Dan Friedman**: We're just messing around. Oh yeah. Nothing. It's like, what happened with you, kushti? Well, nothing much. Like what happened with you qx()? Oh, I got a new hat. Like, you know, you don't have that. It never happens. There's always something happening beyond, beyond hats and you know, kushti's refrigerator and stuff, you know, it just, there are things, there are things, there's always developers, there's always stuff happening. So you know, I, I, I know there are some people get really triggered about this in the community. Sorry, but it is what it is. I do not get depressed about price because I'm not thinking about price because I'm not thinking about selling my ERG. I'm thinking about building on Ergo. That's what I'm thinking about. And that's what all everybody here is thinking about. I mean, you know, he's behind the eight ball right now and he's still thinking about, will the price of ERG go up?

[65:17] **kushti**: Yeah, but about the whole crypto space. So yeah, unfortunately, so all the pricing can see that it's a science point to yes, that means bull markets over folks. We are golden. All right. All right. Yeah, yeah, so yeah the crypto now unfortunately is connected with traditional markets right somehow because of ETF Bitcoin and so on and I think well Ergo well ecosystem should find ways to be counter cyclical right so cyclical. Because crypto should be counter-cyclical, so hard economic times are already there. Not in the developing world, but in the rest of the world which is not developing. The idea of crypto, I think, is to provide counter-cyclical tooling to get out of shocks and crashes on traditional markets, let's say. And yeah, I think the Ergo movement should be the first, so it should realize the original vision after all.

[66:51] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. I mean, that's what I'm here for, you know, and, you know, I have some people saying like, well, you know, Dan, just so you don't think about this stuff, because you're already rich. Like, no, I'm not. Like, not at all, actually. Like, really, really not at all. People just think because you've been in crypto long. You're automatically rich. I'm not like I'm really not I'm even more not rich now that I that I just spent all this money starting a company in the Ergo ecosystem for the past two years, you know, so definitely not so and I'm still not thinking about oh, you know what what if I I hope Ergo goes back to 20 bucks I can dump it. It's like, no, I'm not thinking about that. I'm thinking about, you know, I hope Ergo can do all this other shit, the stuff that I need to do so that I can expand my business. That's what I'm thinking about. And I mean, it's fine if, you know, some people like the whole price thing, it's fine. I'm not judging, but it doesn't mean that all of us are sitting around and, you know, crying about price and thinking like, oh my God, why doesn't it go up, why doesn't it go down? You know, like I said, I know some people get really triggered by that. You know, sorry. Not sorry. Anyway. All right, guys. Look, this is a good time to end it for this week.

[68:23] **qx()**: My social battery is at 1%.

[68:24] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah, get your social battery charged. kushti is off and on. kushti is itching. He's ready to code. He's done. Yeah, yeah. He's like, I got important blockchain stuff to take care of. I gotta go. He's like, I just need a Sigma chains while you were talking. I got a couple more blockchains to build on Scorex. Scorex awaits. You're taking up Scorex's time. Anyway.

[68:48] **kushti**: All right. And so once again, folks, there will be no AMA next week. So next week we will have Twitter spaces with Nervos folks on blockchain powered peer-to-peer economy.

[69:03] **Dan Friedman**: All right. And I'll be there too. I'll be on that. I'll be in your, I'll be in your space and in your face qx().

[69:10] **qx()**: You're gonna be there. That's amazing, Dan.

[69:12] **Dan Friedman**: All right, let's do it.

[69:15] **qx()**: All right. Ciao everybody.

[69:17] **Dan Friedman**: All right guys. Thanks for tuning in. And yeah, I guess what same well, no not next week's the week. Did you even listen? Did you even fucking listen Dan? No, I don't listen to you. Who are you? Are you speaking now? Yeah, I listened to kushti. kushti, you know, I gotta listen to kushti for real. He kind of he kind of captivates me and it's it's like it's like when when you hear a voice in your head and it's actually in your head and you can't tune it out. That's kushti for me. I just, I have to listen to everything he says and understand and comprehend. Anyway, guys, week after next, same time, same place, same channel. And until then, yeah, see you two weeks. I am Dan and this is kushti and that is whoever it is. Yeah. All right guys, signing off.
