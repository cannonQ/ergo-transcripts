[00:00] **qx()**: Awesome. Where were we? I was talking about... Gosh, I even forgot what I was talking about.

[00:05] SPEAKER_00: You were looking for people for your...

[00:08] **qx()**: Yes, thank you. You're young. Vigiloso. Yeah, perfect. So that's a general idea, if anything just got cut off or not. This person will take a little cut off each sale. Right now we have a healthy stock of it looks like we're back on YouTube. So that's perfect. Great, and you don't forget to send me question links. And sure, I still have the old list it's okay. I'll keep them up Andy. Perfect. Thanks.

[00:44] **qx()**: So yeah, so I have all the stock we have a plethora of Make mining great again hats. We have sweatshirts that have the Ergo logo on them and we have t-shirts that have the - kushti is there a name for that guy? What's the name of the astronaut Sigmanauts that old little thing?

[01:06] **mgPai**: That old do I have a sticker here? Hang on. Yeah, right here in my drawer.

[01:13] **qx()**: What's his name? Does he have a name, kushti?

[01:17] **kushti**: Oh, but it's just Ergonaut.

[01:19] **qx()**: That's just Ergonaut?

[01:21] **kushti**: Yeah, on the moon, yeah.

[01:23] **qx()**: Ergonaut, the first.

[01:25] **kushti**: Moon mining, yeah.

[01:28] **qx()**: Moon mining, perfect.

[01:29] **kushti**: Ergonaut, yeah.

[01:31] **qx()**: So we have t-shirts with that logo on them as well. Yeah. So if you're interested, please reach out to me on Telegram or respond to that Twitter message. As I said, there's already one or two people interested, I think. So hopefully that'll look up, take a lot of burden off, spread out the burden, which is good in a decentralized community like this. So super cool.

What else? Oh, I'll show you guys this. Do I have? I can't show you guys this. But I'm looking at loading, I loaded Cyberverse before I started up, and since their cross-chain launch, they've, they're, I mean, it's what, 9:26 on Eastern time? And they have 132 players live in there. Yeah, it's fantastic. So the streets are busy. You hit them, you hit the over you map and you can see little pink dots walking around. You know, the green dots are AI, not AI, but computer players, NPCs and the pink dots are users just bouncing around the screen. So it's really, really cool to see that kind of success.

And I think it just proves that you know, sometimes these things take time, right? Not everything's catch fire and burn fast and this is a this is a prime example of a product that has stayed true to their values and Ergo values and just continued to push and build and they're recognizing success. Yeah, super super cool Christian we got to get you on cyberverse man.

[03:06] **kushti**: Yeah, well, hard to find time, but I'll try maybe this weekend.

[03:14] **qx()**: Watch it. kushti discovered Cyberverse and sub-blocks are in five years. Node 6 is like 10 years away now. He said, look at my player level 20 guys. And we're like, kushti, go back to sub-blocks, man. We're going to have to, we'd have to get Mr. Pixel to shut the servers down.

[03:36] **kushti**: That's a fine time, yeah, really.

[03:40] **qx()**: So that's really exciting. What else? Sigmanauts mining pool is still trucking along. We are at, let's see, what gigahash? We're at 72 gigahash this morning. Usually we ride around 94, 95, but sometimes people shut them off for night time or daytime, depending if their electricity costs are high.

Mark wrote a script last week that automatically clears out the logs because we you know we're running logs on storage rent as well as mining core so so those guys can build up and when we're trying to keep the price of the servers down we only have about 40 gigs of playroom so sometimes after a couple after a month or so those those drives can really fill up. So he's written a script that wipes those logs every once in a while to keep the server in tip-top shape. So that's great.

What else? Oh, so students come back. Gosh hang on maybe that's why I feel so depressed lately Students at Cornell come back come back on Tuesday because we have Martin Luther King down I believe but the good news is that's when That's when they'll be introduced to the Cornell BRICK. So I'm really excited to see how was that Wait, where have you been? What rock have you been living under this year?

[05:00] **qx()**: What a rock. So Cornell BRICK is our idea of trying to stimulate a local economy at my college. So the idea is we have, unless it's a useful token, then it's never going to get used. So we're providing a use for it. And that use is that I've rewritten the front end and kind of a little bit of the back end of our plot submission process.

So right now students go to a web portal, they submit a plot, it goes to the back end, our student workers look at the plot, they open it up, they send it out, the students are notified all along the way and they go pick it up at a cubby when they're done. So the idea was to integrate the blockchain into that. So I've modified the front end and like a side bot that monitors a chain.

So when students print, they can choose blockchain payment. And as soon as they choose it, they submit it. They get a pop-up in the payment channel in our Discord. We have a Discord that's used by, gosh, we probably have about 1,800 alum and current students in there now. So they're gonna pop up there that says hey so-and-so, you know Your plot number was this the cost is this if you want to pay in ERG copy this text if you want to pay in Cornell BRICK Copy this text. So all it is is code for the tipper bot So we're gonna introduce everybody to the blockchain via the tipper bot.

So they basically yeah Pacing the code and whether it's BRICK or ERG and the back end knows, you know, it's like it's like auction house not auction house Ergo raffle where it's like five digits of a unique So that's how we tell who it is, you know what I mean

So once the scanner sees that it marks the plot as plottable and then it shows up in the back end to the to the student workers to be able to send it But yeah, so we're going to first of all, we're gonna give BRICK to our student workers so there's we have an 18 student workers that we're gonna give them to so that'll hopefully kind of started that way, as well as we'll have some incentives to hand it out to the rest of the student body as well, maybe a handful to everybody. So everybody gets a couple free plots at the start of the semester if they use that system. And then we'll find other ways to hand them out.

So the idea is that the plotting center will give this token kind of a value. You know, like, this is valuable to me because instead of spending $12 on a plot, I'm going to use a couple of these tokens. So there's some value right there for the tokens. So then the idea is not everybody's going to use them. And there can be developing some sort of trade in between, like, can we have this book or this tool? Can I swap you this? Oh, here's a BRICK for that or that kind of thing. So that's going to be fun and interesting, and that'll of course wrap into the Cornell demurrage hierarchy as well.

[07:50] SPEAKER_00: So what is the plot exactly?

[07:53] **qx()**: Oh, it's just like a 42-inch wide piece of paper by seven feet. Think about architecture plans like, you know, blueprints, kind of thing. Well, the students weekly, every bi-weekly, you know, several times a month, they'll have these critiques where they have to lay out the boards of their projects, so they'll have different views of their building or their design and different cross-sections, and they'll put it all out neatly on a thing with maybe some explanation sometimes. No, usually not text. And they'll put it up on the boards, and then the faculty rake them over the coals and tell them why they're wrong and why it's awful. It's all part of the learning process in architecture. So that's a plot.

[08:32] SPEAKER_00: That's interesting.

[08:33] **qx()**: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, so it's a busy thing in architecture school. Since 2020, we have 64,000 plots that have come across our desk that we've printed for the students. So it's a lot. Yeah, it's a main part of the thing.

So yeah, so that's super exciting when that When that happens a little nervous, but I tested the code as much as I could and it seems to be working So I mean, it's a good thing about being in a controlled environment like a school, you know, if it breaks You know what's gonna happen. You don't have like investors coming at you yelling at you. So you just I don't know and say sorry guys We're working on fixing it and then you fix it So there is that leisure that you have when you're doing something like an academic thing like that

[09:19] **kushti**: Yeah, so I think such environments are well experimentation friendly, right, by definition. Also, so, well, no issue, right, if something would be buggy. Well, it's quite exciting. I mean, so finally, Ergo is going to real world, which is more important than even more important than just, you know, games and, well, blockchains and boxes like, I don't know, like having DeFi applications disconnected from the real world, right?

Well, finally, we have, you know, honey been sold on Ergo, and Macbooks, and now also students' currency and so on. So, yeah, that's a very important step forward.

[10:19] **qx()**: And I think I mentioned this maybe in Sigmanauts meeting, because I don't think I was in the AMA last week, but the really cool thing about MewFinance is seller protection, right? Right now, you know you read horror stories about eBay where the the buyer gets an item and they're like Oh, it's not the right one or I don't like it They send a bad one back eBay sides on the case of the buyer because they don't want to scare away the buyers, right? There's always some seller to come so it's a buyer's you don't want to scare away so with MewFinance, it's a combination of Trust I guess but what's the word I'm looking for?

Reputation, right? So if Sigma Shop starts screwing people over, we're done. You know, that's all we have is our reputation. And then as a seller too, it's amazing that the money comes in directly to our wallet and I don't have to worry about a bank clawing it back or eBay clawing it back because somebody bitches kind of thing.

So, it's a great combination of reputation of the seller and the seller actually providing and feeling safe that the money's there and it's not going to be clawed back. So, I think it's better than eBay in that aspect. So, I encourage everybody, if you have stuff, anything, stuff you're not using, stuff you want to get rid of, see if the Sigmanauts, if you can't get a store yourself on MewFinance, see if the Sigmanauts will co-sign. Yeah, that's the word for it. Consigned there we go. It's spelled similarly Consign it for you. So you'd essentially just ship it to us We'd look it over make sure it's okay and then post it for you at your price Take a little bit off the top, of course for a service and do it there.

So please I mean, I'm sure the stuff you guys are sitting around on like look at this Do you know what this is MG pai I Don't know looks like a plastic BRICK to me.

[12:24] **qx()**: Alright, let's see. Alright, so Andy says that we should get some questions in the old question chat and then he's gonna refresh it so that we see the new chat. So let me look through the old questions. Let's see if it'll work. Oh, it still works. Alright, here we go. I don't think any of it, well, mgPai should know this. When Palm Token will be available to trade on DEX, MG?

[12:50] SPEAKER_00: So, I mean, of course I can't reveal anything but I can say that there is a public sale happening I think next week or so something like that so I think in I mean if you want like all this like type of alpha knowledge right you got to join the spaces that Palm hosts right we do spaces on X quite frequently so I believe it was said in that space that Like within a month or so, Palm should be available to like freely trade some things along those lines. But I can't give any accurate details on that, but it is of course very soon because the public sale is next week.

[13:41] **qx()**: Alrighty. Let's see. kushti, maybe this one's for you. It doesn't make sense to me. Do you have public block producer calls? If so, when and where? Are they speaking like just like phone calls or calls like programming calls? API calls. Is that what it is?

[14:02] **kushti**: Or a block producer calls. What do they mean?

[14:14] **kushti**: probably actually mean like that like phone like zoom calls meeting yeah yeah yeah block producer but no we don't know what does that mean it's like miners or mining pools I don't even have contacts of all the pools now so recently I've asked qx() about one right Yeah, the biggest one, actually. So, yeah, well, and about getting them on the call, I mean, why? Good luck finding them, I mean. Yes, so some guys are pretty anonymous, and then you have a way to make a call even. Yeah, it is tough. Everyone is doing its own business.

[15:10] **qx()**: Yep, we have about 50, 60 people connected to the Sigmanauts mining pool. And I'd say only a dozen or so are very active and chatting, right? So the rest of them prefer to stay in the shadows and watch and continue to mine. So yeah, it would be interesting. And that's just our pool. That's just a Sigmanauts pool across the board. I think it might be a little interesting, that's for sure. Some sort of block producer group.

that has generally i don't know i wonder that seems to organize alex that seems against not against but that seems anti what what it is i guess i don't know interesting it would be interesting yeah but also yeah i mean why to do that even so yeah yeah what's the incentive i mean i guess it'd be nice to like when node updates come up alex so you could like have a reminder hey guys update your nodes and the mining core

[16:09] **kushti**: Yeah so currently well so last time we've asked pools back in 2022 so yeah well during 5.0 soft fork update right And yeah, before it was NIPoPoWs merge sudden hard fork and before it was EP27 soft fork, right? So well, yeah, all those updates were back in 2022. And yes, since then, so well, I'm not in touch. Yeah, no, no, not just me. So back then like half of connections I was made by Joe probably so Yes since then so I I don't know even which versions they're running Five or somewhat probably but maybe five one zero

So, I don't even know, and also why. So, well...

[17:28] SPEAKER_00: You know, speaking of mining, I do have a question for kushti. So recently, I think there was an issue on with nodes that if you submit like a transaction right now, it's not going to be included in the current block, right? It always gets included in like block N plus one or N plus two or so on. Right. And there's an issue that's fixed. That's the issue has been fixed. What are your plans on merging that into the main node and having the pools all update their versions? Why are we holding up on that?

[18:10] **kushti**: Well, one of the reasons is because you and the other guys are not reviewing PRs even earlier.

[18:17] **qx()**: Oh, burn!

[18:18] **kushti**: So, yeah, I mean, do your job for V3. We don't do releases. So, I'm not, you know, like... Yeah, I can't do releases without reviews. I mean, it's... So, you're waiting on a review for that?

Not for that, just for previous releases. The plan for the next one is to include fixes for indexer. There are, I believe, a couple of other PRs for next miner releases. And then we can do that release with only PR, which is about regenerating block candidates. So the plan is to have only this PR and inform mining pools about that and all that stuff. Before that we need to release other minor versions, so there is some logic in development as well.

Okay. Yeah, it's at all. It's then depends on the reviewers like you basically.

[19:51] SPEAKER_00: Yeah. So we should say, yeah, we should, I should certainly prioritize reviewing that I think, and whatever is sequential. So I guess before that, because this will be a huge like quality update, right? When transacting on Ergo, it'll appear that your transactions confirm much faster, right? Because it will get immediately included in the current block or the next block instead of like block plus current block plus two. So this will be a huge update to everyone and this is a very low-hanging fruit so we should certainly attack this.

[20:29] **kushti**: Yeah, I mean a lot of things to be checked also so this should be a well-dedicated release. And yeah, well, there is some logic, you know, in development, so there are other things, and then, yeah, we are blocked by, well, absence of reviews at the moment.

[20:53] **qx()**: In the new chat, guys, we've got a whole minor chat going. They're talking about cards and clocking and locking the memory. Super cool. Super cool to watch.

Alright, let's see. We've got the big 3d says any updates. I'm cracking exchange listings and you know what the big 3d when I reached out to mark mark greenberg our buddy our ergo holder mark greenberg now after he left he said he was going to try to talk to dave brumfeld if it's dm brumfeld i believe right crypto dave to open up his dm so we could chat with him and crypto dave hasn't yet so while you guys were arguing with each other and kushti was insulting you mg pai for not doing reviews

I pinged Mark again and asked him, I told him I hope his new job is treating him well and it's everything he's ever dreamed of. And then I reminded him about getting Brumfield to open his DMs or chat with us. So hopefully we get some word there and we can... Continue that conversation get it kicked up again and again Kraken listing is for access right? We're not looking for we all know how disappointing it is Most crypto exchange launches right everybody gets this big high bow the price is gonna moon and that kind of thing so

Everybody should look at this kind of stuff as you know, we're getting more access for US customers for people who are to use Kraken specifically To ERG, which is very great spreading liquidity across those exchanges. So super cool If he does that.

All right, let's see sub-blocks kushti they want to know how sub-blocks are going Yeah, so

[22:46] **kushti**: Well, there is progress, right? Polishing EAP still needs to include arguments about security, right? Because, well, it shouldn't be done like, I don't know, most of protocol updates in the space, like, I don't know, developers are doing something And then, well, it's just getting shielded by marketing folks, right? And that's it. So there is need for security arguments for treatment. So, well, we will check papers on similar constructions.

like Tailstorm, but Prism probably, so Prism has somewhat satisfying, well, security arguments. Then, well, then, yeah, writing the code, so, yeah, well, hopefully, well, so currently I have already local miners generating sub-blocks, input blocks, but the contents are not valid, just basically empty.

So now the idea is to properly spread transactions according to the EEP draft and properly form I needed fields and well there are a lot of things to get done on the way especially about well updating proofs well state transformation proofs which is actually one of the reasons why well transaction is not getting into a block immediately so well

that there is need to check state transformation proof. In ergo we have a lot of modes of operation, so it's possible to run what like 90 percent of people are doing, so they're just running with default settings and not which is holding QTXO set, right? But also Ergo is supporting stateless clients, right? It was the first cryptocurrency with stateless clients. And actually, still, I believe the only one where stateless clients are based on just hash-based cryptography. So not any MoonMath cryptography. So, well, just very simple actually, hash-based cryptography.

And then, yeah, it's also then possible to use NIPoPoWs. right and so on and well yeah it's a lot of complexity so well we are discussing possible nodes not alternative node implementation maybe in Rust right in coming years as well Sigma Rust is making progress but then yeah well with all those mods it would be quite tricky so maybe it makes sense to do some

I don't know dedicated clients just like maybe nippo pole based for status right suitable maybe for very limited environments maybe where internet connection is well near to none

Going back to sub-blocks, we are now going to handle state transformation proofs and transactions and all that stuff. In case of luck, maybe next week there will be a local DevNet on my machine with all those things done with transactions properly going into input blocks. And then, yeah, well, there is need for polishing and then a lot of details to be considered like updating how to update stratum proxy for miners, right, if we are talking about external miner, how to update APYs, right, how to add support to applications and so on.

Yeah, a lot of tricky details. How to do pruning, by the way, because, well, with more transactions going into blocks, maybe, right, there is need for more aggressive pruning. Yeah, it also depends. So I'm now asking application developers like qx(), for example.

So what are their plans in regards with using Corollaps and so on, right? Because, well, based on that we may will handle some things ahead of time, like roll-up constructions. So it could be done much better than done in Ethereum, for example, in regards with storing blobs and pruning them and so on.

So yeah, a lot of tricky details and then Some things also to be considered for the future, such as supporting sub-block-based, input-block-based sidechains. How you can make a sidechain progressing sub-block-by-sub-block basically.

which is probably requiring to add something to validation context, but that's pretty tricky, but yeah, there are some things too. to be considered here, maybe even in a velvet-forking way after, well, sub-block deployment. But then there is also question how to do that right in so soft-forkish way. So yeah, a lot of questions. So yeah, I'm continuing to write down details and well, some plans for our future into EP. And yeah, the court is progressing.

[30:15] **qx()**: While you guys were chatting, I checked out my Rosenwatcher and I try to check out my watcher once a week to make sure it's running. I have a watcher on Bitcoin, ERG, BTC, and Ethereum. But mainly my ERG ones are Bezias. And every week it's between 150, 250, Rosen which means that I'm making 12 to 15 ERG per week Running this Ergo watcher. It's it's absolutely amazing. I mean, that's hey, you don't even do anything Well, come on. I'm doing something MG by it's some work running this passive Yeah, so it's super super awesome, you know just make sure to reboot it once in a while that it's running and

Make sure the node it's connected to is functioning and good. So yeah, I mean it's it's it's it's amazing. Yep. Yep. So I encourage people who aren't doing this to do this because I mean, we're in the infancy of this thing and I'm doing 12 ERG a month a week. Sorry.

[31:20] SPEAKER_00: I mean, if you're not selling Rosen, right, there's always upside.

[31:24] **qx()**: Yeah, yeah. No, I've already taken my last big batch. I just added it to a new permit. Once it got to 3000, I just pumped it back into one of them. And this is only on the Ergo side. I am only running Ten permits on the Ergo side. Yeah, and the most at any time And this is when the bridge was waiting for funds to transfer. I think I had five or six permits out So I haven't maxed out on that yet. So so yeah encourage people who have rosen sitting there and aren't doing anything with it Please, you know spin up a watcher. We have videos from version one That are pretty similar to what it is now to set it up. The instructions are pretty good tried and tested Give it a go.

[32:10] **kushti**: All right and by the way about input blocks and well some additional source of income. So currently well miners are packing right input blocks but what I'm thinking about maybe to add to outline how it could be done in future so maybe in future like everyone can do an input block basically right along with zero knowledge proof of its validity and sent to a miner for inclusion right and then a miner It needs to just check proof and includes everything. And then you can basically earn from generating zero-knowledge proofs.

[33:14] SPEAKER_00: I like that. I think you can encourage people to run node, right? Based on that idea, because you can just have like the node software itself be the one to generate. Right.

[33:26] **kushti**: So there are lots of tricky details here for sure. And well, I'm well tracking the state of zero knowledge proof. So maybe it's still too early, right? especially if we are talking about, well, retail capabilities to generate proofs. But, yeah, well, it's progressing, so maybe in a few years, yeah, that would become reality.

[33:56] SPEAKER_00: Yeah, so I guess basically the idea is you get paid to run a node and the possibility of that, so... That would be quite, that would be pretty amazing. It's not very much seen in the crypto space, right? To get paid to run nodes, right? So that would be pretty nice.

[34:15] **kushti**: Yeah, because it's quite tricky to do, right? Well, yeah. If you are willing to pay for a node, then this node should produce some verifiable work. Otherwise, it probably would be always not resistant to civil attacks, so you can always generate a lot of nodes. Yeah, do inflation basically just by spamming a network with nodes created just in order to get tokens, right? Yes. That's actually how the first proof-of-work currency failed, I believe. I forgot its name. One created by Hal Finny before Bitcoin, like PoW Cash or something like that.

So yeah, the problem. There was basically inflation when people... So there was no dynamic difficulty and so on, so people just created a lot of notes and the cost of inflation. And then a few years after, Bitcoin appeared.

[35:43] **qx()**: Could you just CPU mine the node and post that proof in a block so it shows you're actually running and using the node? I mean it won't do any good, you know, CPU mining, but you could govern it to do 10% of your CPU, show that it's CPU mining your node and put that proof on the chain. That would be proof that the node's running, it's up to date, and somebody's active on it kind of thing, no?

[36:09] **kushti**: Yeah, actually, there are ideas like to have a double proof-of-work system, right? So first, a kind of actors doing proof-of-work to pack transactions into... it's called FRUITS. And then miners, second-class miners are packing fruits into blocks, right? So that's quite old idea from 2016, I believe. 17 fruits chain. And yeah, I'm not sure about implementations, actually. Well, to the best of my knowledge, midnight plans at some point, but I'm not sure about now.

And yeah, so that's possible. But then, yeah, so you have just competition in two dimensions, right? So, well, in regards with one kind of proof work and another kind of proof work. And it's quite hard to predict, well, how secure it would be, but yeah, well, let's see, so maybe just, well, approves generation. Well, this kind of proof-of-work, right, kind of work would be quite good for just, well, forming, well, fruits, right, so, well, parts of blocks with transactions, the input blocks here in Ergo, basically.

And then, yes, the second-class managers are doing kind of real proof-of-work, how to like us. Iterations, yeah, well, they're packing into blocks, right? They are confirming them by using, yeah, ordering blocks. So, like, for four blocks now.

[38:19] **qx()**: All right, guys, we got a good question here. From Augustus Kent, how easy would it be for Bitcoin to copy Ergo's unique features if they are proven to be needed, i.e. could BTC just soft fork and add storage rent?

[38:34] **kushti**: Yeah, so I think, well, the chance is about zero, right? So one of the lowest hanging fruits which discussed in Bitcoin community since 2000, Oh, 11, probably 12. Yeah, so it is about, well, including UTXO set confirmations. It was called in the Bitcoin community to block headers, right, somehow, or maybe other parts of the block, so it's possible to commit maybe even via Coinbase transactions, so not breaking the protocol. Just soft forkish or maybe even a little bit forkish way, but yeah, it's still not there. But, you know, well, it would be highly beneficial for like hundreds of protocols.

So like, well, SPV wallets, well, light clients, trustless relays, cross chains. And so on. Well, sidechains. So a lot of applications, but it's still not there. So about, well, introducing storage rent. So I see there are now a lot of discussions in the Bitcoin community in regards with what to do with security budget, which is shrinking, right? And, yeah, well, the most popular proposals are about introducing storage rent or, well, introducing Taylor Mission somehow.

But, yeah, I'm not sure it's possible to, well, updates the bitcoin protocol here as well right so probably that would create a lot of drama on the way maybe maybe more split so maybe we will see bitcoin demurrage and then what else bitcoin telemission and then yeah bitcoin classic i don't know bitcoin core maybe let's see let's see but yeah in general updating

anything in the Bitcoin protocol since like 2011 is nearly impossible so there were actually quite dramatic changes in early years like 2009, 10 maybe 11 like early 11 but yes since then it's It's about soft forks only. And yeah, well, soft forks of some specific kind. So they are now, well, spending a few years discussing whether it's worth to reintroduce opcodes switched off back in 2010, right? So, well, it was easy to switch them off, but to switch it on, just one of them, which is well useful for, needed for some roll-ups and so on, roll-up constructions and so on.

So yeah, that's big drama, even that, even getting back one opcode switched off temporarily, actually back in 2010.

[42:31] **qx()**: Have you guys, well we're getting near time, but a couple more things. Have you guys seen the C8's new project that he whipped together?

[42:38] **kushti**: Yeah, yeah, so... Just today I've tried to create another row of transactions made as quickly as possible. That was actually quite an awesome experience. All of them today are finished in a block.

So if you guys are up for playing with SigmaRSV or SigmaUSD and converting back and forth, that is a site for you. It's with a new Nautilus. You can chain those puppies and spam it, and it's pretty neat.
