# Ergo Blockchain Community Call Summary
**Date:** June 21, 2024  
**Title:** Weekly Update & AMA - June 20th 2024

## Executive Summary

This weekly Ergo community call featured significant updates on multiple fronts, with the most notable being the successful launch of the Rosen BTC bridge, marking a major milestone for cross-chain interoperability. The team discussed the completion of the Ergo community vote (with an embarrassing oversight of missing kushti's Bitcoin relay project), upcoming ErgoHack results, and various ecosystem developments including new DEX solutions and wallet improvements.

The call also covered upcoming events including the Ergoversary celebration and RareEvo conference, while addressing technical questions about bridge security, watcher node operations, and regulatory implications of European MiCA regulations. Dan Friedman teased a major Palmyra announcement scheduled for just hours after the call, promising new innovative tooling for the Ergo ecosystem.

## Notable Quotes

**qx() on centralized exchanges:** "I fucking hate centralized exchanges. I'm a community member, by the way. I'm not Ergo Foundation. So I can say I fucking hate centralized exchanges. And I can't wait for a day when fiat on-ramp comes to Rosen Bridge."

**kushti on WBTC vs RSBTC:** "WBTC is just a centralized gateway, right? So basically one trusted party... when it's closed source, so how can you trust those claims? I mean, any claims."

**Dan Friedman on regulatory complexity:** "The thing about regulations like this is like, for example, in Japan... they started slapping on a lot of like, just convolutedness and essentially suffocated the crypto spring in Japan."
