      "asker": "implicit from mgPai's presentation",
      "answer": "They coded an entire game called Doom on-chain that was entirely running on Hydra. Every movement, every shot, everything you did in the game was an on-chain transaction. The game ran at 32 frames per second, which means 32 transactions per second on Hydra. They were running three Hydra heads to achieve this performance.",

      "asker": "qx()",
      "answer": "It's about miner signaling and automatic activation, similar to all soft forks. A couple of validation rules will be deactivated that are touching on serialization and doing obsolete checks where there is new functionality now. Old versions will still be in sync as they will deactivate the same rules and skip validation of scripts not being recognized.",

      "asker": "Vydom",
      "answer": "Integration won't be as long as Ledger. It's much simpler and more frictionless because you don't have to talk to a lot of people for official approval like with Ledger, which takes a lot of time. Work has restarted on the integration and it's going pretty well. They may reach out to the Ergo DAO for help once responsibilities are structured.",

      "asker": "Michael (via kushti)",
      "answer": "It's about 70% complete. There were some issues in the contract implementation that required a smaller refactor, which LGD is working on. Once that's done, they'll begin the off-chain implementation again. The system will be robust with features like paying with any token and recursive sub names from the start.",

This is the entry point into traceability, and the phone application will be directly connected to the Ergo chain. Traceability metadata that businesses input will be stored directly on Ergo.",

      "asker": "Neuro",
      "answer": "The problem with long ErgoHacks is that people get distracted with real-life matters like families and jobs. Most developers would probably spend the same amount of time (just one or two weekends) whether it's three days or one month. There's not much difference for most people between three days and one month - they'd dedicate at most three days anyway.",
