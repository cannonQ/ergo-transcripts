# Ergo Blockchain Community Call Summary
**Date:** January 16, 2025  
**Call Title:** Ergo PoW Blockchain - Weekly Update & AMA

## Executive Summary

The weekly Ergo community call focused heavily on the upcoming 6.0 release and sub-blocks implementation progress. Kushti announced that the 6.0 audit by Dusek is proceeding well, with testnet activation planned for January 17th and mainnet activation potentially beginning in March 2025. Significant progress was reported on sub-blocks prototype development, with a local DevNet demo expected next week.

Beyond core development, the call highlighted important ecosystem developments including the completion of the Dexy Gold audit (18 contracts reviewed) and ongoing work on SigmaUSD Oracle Pool version 2. The discussion also emphasized the need for better coordination across Ergo's decentralized development teams and standardization of off-chain bot frameworks to improve the developer experience.
