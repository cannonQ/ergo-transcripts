# Ergo Blockchain Community Call Summary
**Call Date:** June 23, 2024  
**Call Title:** Dev Update June 23 2024 | Live AMA Edition w/Armeanio

## Executive Summary

This was the 121st developer update call, featuring a free-flowing discussion between qx() and Joseph Armeanio covering ErgoHack VIII, the philosophical foundations of cryptocurrency, and the tension between short-term speculation and long-term vision. The conversation emphasized Ergo's commitment to first principles over regulatory compliance, with particular focus on proof-of-work mining as a global wealth distribution mechanism and the importance of building resilient, censorship-resistant financial infrastructure.

The discussion highlighted the ongoing challenge of balancing immediate market demands with the foundational goals of cryptocurrency - creating neutral, open platforms that serve as alternatives to traditional financial systems. Both speakers emphasized their commitment to building for the long term (5-10 year horizon) rather than chasing short-term market trends.

## Notable Quotes

**Armeanio:** "I really think that survivability is why Bitcoin is king, because it's died hundreds of times... So, you know, I really think that should be the net goal of open systems is to try to be resilient rather than compliant."

**qx():** "At that point, Joe, it's going to be no fucking different than the other leaders in the spaces. And I think at that point, Ergo is going to shine and it's going to be painfully obvious to other people why Ergo is what it is and what we've been working towards, hopefully."

**Armeanio:** "Consumer-grade hardware proof-of-work can feed people. Like that's huge. If you actually care about like decentralized networks and growing those energy inputs and creating value globally, that's massive."
