# Ergo Community Call Summary: SigmaQuest | TMR.ΣRG | ErgoHack 10

**Call Date:** 2025-06-27  
**Duration:** ~11 minutes

## Executive Summary

Timer (tmr.erg) presented SigmaQuest, their first coding project and submission to ErgoHack 10. This innovative blockchain-based game represents a significant achievement for a self-described non-developer who learned to code specifically for this project. SigmaQuest is a three-part adventure game that combines AI-powered storytelling with blockchain mechanics, featuring a honeypot wallet containing approximately 200 ERG as the grand prize for the first person to complete all three games.

The project showcases the accessibility of building on Ergo, demonstrating how newcomers can create sophisticated applications by leveraging AI tools like Claude and Cursor for development assistance. Timer emphasized their commitment to open-sourcing the project after completion to help other new developers learn from their experience, including detailed documentation and developer guides.

## Key Discussion Points

• **Game Structure**: Three sequential games costing 10 ERG each to play, requiring players to collect 15 seed words total (5 per game) to access the prize wallet

• **AI Integration**: Heavy use of Claude AI for dynamic content generation, including creative death scenarios and adaptive challenges that change with each playthrough

• **Game Mechanics**:
  - Game 1: Logic puzzle involving AI conversation to escape a cryopod
  - Game 2: Oregon Trail-style text adventure with AI-generated death scenarios for wrong choices
  - Game 3: AI-judged problem-solving challenges culminating in a final boss with dynamically generated questions

• **Educational Value**: Comprehensive documentation and developer guides planned for release post-completion to help other newcomers build on Ergo

• **Prize Pool**: Started with community contributions, will be increased to ~200 ERG, with potential for growth as more players participate (30 ERG per complete playthrough)

## Decisions Made

• The honeypot wallet will be increased to approximately 200 ERG before game launch
• GitHub repository will be made public immediately after someone wins the prize
• Game will be advertised to attract multiple players and increase the prize pool
• Complete developer documentation will be provided to help future builders
