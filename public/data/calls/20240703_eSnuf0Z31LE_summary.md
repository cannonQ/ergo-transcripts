# Ergo Blockchain Community Call Summary
**Date:** July 3, 2024  
**Title:** Dan's Ergoversary Message | Dan Friedman | Ergoversary Summit 2024

## Executive Summary

Dan Friedman delivered an enthusiastic anniversary message celebrating Ergo's five-year mainnet milestone from Japan. As both an advisor to the Ergo Foundation and founder of Palmyra (an Ergo-centric business), Dan highlighted the exceptional innovation, true decentralization, and robust technical infrastructure that sets Ergo apart in the Web3 space. He emphasized his confidence in Ergo's technology by sharing his decision to invest significant personal capital into building Palmyra on the Ergo blockchain.
