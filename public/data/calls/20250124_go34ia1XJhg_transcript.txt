[02:34] **qx()**: Let's see.

[02:35] **qx()**: I've got you hear us, Andy?

[02:42] **Dan Friedman**: QX, what did you do?

[02:43] **qx()**: I didn't do anything. I don't have control of this.

[02:47] **Dan Friedman**: You're exactly, you're out of control, man.

[02:50] **qx()**: You're in. Andy, Andy, I've got YouTube on, so I'm listening for free. Come back. But Andy, you there?

[03:02] **qx()**: There we go.

[03:03] **kushti**: All right, you're good kushti we've got volume now. All right. All right, so let's repeat the introduction part otherwise say it would be disconnected my part from others.

[03:18] **qx()**: I mean, let's try again. Let's try again. Hello everybody. Good morning You can skip you can skip that day and it was like a five out of ten

[03:29] **Dan Friedman**: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

[03:40] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah, all right. Well, the sound is here right now and... Hey, everybody! Welcome once again to the AMA.

[03:50] **Dan Friedman**: And so, yeah, I have... Well, you know, now that we don't have contacts, I have to my stage right, I have none other than kushti. Say hi to everybody again, Alex.

[04:06] **kushti**: Hi, everyone. It's my pleasure to be here again.

[04:10] **Dan Friedman**: Again for the second time today and to my stage left I have a certain yahoo named qx. Huge yahoo. Good morning everybody.

[04:25] **Dan Friedman**: Yahoo, that's sometimes serious. So we'll call them yahoo serious. Perfect.

[04:33] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah, exactly. Anyway, all right. Well, let's get started with the AMA. So as I was saying before when nobody could hear me except for Alex and our favorite Yahoo QX.

[04:47] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah, Alex, why don't you give the people a little bit of a breakdown, a rundown of what's been happening?

[04:54] **kushti**: Yeah so a lot of things going on at the same time on different levels. Well in the first place there are a lot of talks in the community now about positioning, you know, the Ergo movement. So it's kind of free movement so everyone is free to position himself and his own group in any way, but yeah well there is also need for coordination.

[05:22] **kushti**: Well, there are certain requests about that, certain demand, especially these days, you know, when, yeah, well, many people have feeling that, well, it's another pivot point for cryptocurrencies, right, cryptocurrency movements because of many events going on at the same time.

[05:56] **kushti**: So yeah, please join discussions and I believe we need to organize some more calls like town halls as soon as possible.

[06:08] **kushti**: So then, yeah, in regards to the development, there is good progress with sub-blocks. So I've got my own local miner-based DevNet just today, well, correctly generating input blocks, sub-blocks with transactions and creating proper commitments.

[06:41] **kushti**: And then as a next step I'm thinking about adding APIs for applications immediately, so some early version may be available in just a few days. And only after that I will jump on actually hardest and very time-consuming parts, but also invisible to application developers such as peer-to-peer network optimizations and so on.

[07:12] **kushti**: But, yeah, well, application developers at least will have a possibility starting from, yeah, very soon, TM, to play with single nodes, local miner-based testing environments, at least, to check how to speed applications up with input blocks, sub-blocks.

[07:43] **kushti**: Then for 6.0 audit is going on. I think there is one small issue left now. We are discussing different issues and aspects of design but currently there is one small issue left unfixed and then we are good with doing public testnet deployment and also then it's a good time to reach mining pools in regards with all possible activation dates.

[08:40] **kushti**: So yeah, a lot of things going on. Then some talks going on. I'm actually pushing for some talks and some decisions in Ergodev's DAO.

[08:57] **kushti**: So, well, the point is, I'm actually thinking to rework the DAO and make PID based DAO. Well, I tried yesterday, actually, but then I got into tokenomics questions, so we are discussing it right now.

[09:23] **kushti**: What I'm proposing is to have just temporary DAOs or Ergodevs 2025, to have very concrete specific goals for 2025 and then also pretty specific funding goals to be met to reach the goals and then yeah also to help very specific concrete initiatives, education initiatives and so on and also help the ecosystem with touring, education, getting new developers.

[10:11] **kushti**: There are some proposals about having something like Google Summer of Codes, right? But yeah, it's winter in the Northern Hemisphere now, so maybe it would be Ergo Winter of Codes. I don't know. Let's see, maybe Spring. Then, what? Spring of Codes actually sounds good.

[10:36] **Dan Friedman**: The Ergo Winter over discontent.

[10:38] **kushti**: The idea is to have just a temporary organization and then fire it up totally at the end of 2025 and start from scratch next year. What's needed, I guess, is also to help developers with different means to find ways to fund applications internally and externally.

[11:25] **kushti**: So I think this is probably the most important matter right now. So there are different talks. It's hard to coordinate and organize this stuff in a totally uncontrollable environment. So, let's see.

[11:50] **qx()**: kushti, how do you manage the treasury with a temporary DAO? Where do you put the treasury? Do you just make sure you transfer it to the new DAO as it hops over?

[11:59] **kushti**: Yeah, so the idea, you know, is to send remaining treasury if there will be remaining ERG at the end of 2025 to the new DAO, right? But, yeah, having totally new members, maybe, even. Right, so the idea is that, you know, every organization should have some limited time frame, I believe.

[12:30] **kushti**: And, yeah, so if there is something persistent, such as treasury, yeah, maybe it's better just to pass to the new organization, right? Yeah, then, well, it should work, right? If there are not many DAO members profiting from treasury, at least, right?

[12:55] **qx()**: We managed to pull it off of the Sigmanauts DAO when we went from beta to production. But it was tricky because we used the same token. So people would unstake from the beta DAO before we fully had everything transferred over. And we had to rely on the last few people that were still on the beta DAO to finish up the token send on the DAO. So that was a fun little test of that kind of theory.

[13:24] **kushti**: All right. And then, yeah, so I think also for, and here's where Ergodevs can synchronize with Sigmanauts. So there is need to have some vision, right, like common vision. Well, what do we imagine when we are talking about future of the ecosystem, right?

[13:51] **kushti**: Because the protocol, well, it's more or less done, right? So, well, if one is taking a look into EAPs, right, then, yeah, it's easy to realize that, yeah, well, all the modifications come so that they are soft-forkish right so well 6.0 is just basically adding new functionality and tweaking existing one just a little bit by fixing just very few things.

[14:33] **kushti**: And then input blocks are backwards compatible, so all clients will just receive full blocks like they are doing now. It's basically the same protocol, just augmented with some peer-to-peer machinery and, yeah, well, enforced in a soft-forkish way, so only miners would recognize the difference, right, because, well, miners do need to generate some new fields, right, but, yeah, all clients can just skip them and that's it.

[15:16] **kushti**: And the idea, you know, is to avoid modifying the protocol so basically at this point Ergo is already like Bitcoin back in 2012-14 right so quite established protocol right maybe still experiencing some developments like what happened with Bitcoin SegWit Taproot right so SegWit soft fork was actually quite hard soft fork yeah well maybe we had even harder with 5.0 where all the clients actually were downloaded to SPV security for all the transactions.

[16:17] **kushti**: 6.0 would be like SegWit in regards to the activation exactly. Yeah, well, only for new kinds of transactions while using new opcodes while existing clients will be downloaded to SPV security, right? Just blindly trusting the new nodes for validation, right? But yeah, only for new kinds of transactions. So I like helping it with SegWit, actually.

[16:53] **kushti**: And they are probably Taproot also, but I am not quite familiar with Taproot activation details, to be honest. And then input blocks are just about modifying peer-to-peer level, adding some new structures to block extension, a section of a block right and so it would be even more soft right and then yeah so the idea basically is to have a protocol which is not touched a lot right and then which can be evolved by building on top of it right so without application developers having fear that's you know the core protocol would break everything like many blockchains around actually can change block time even where you know well it's possible to do contracts based on block height which is quite insane because basically that means that during such changes all the applications relying on block heights have been broken and so on but yeah that's what's going on but I think the proper way is to follow the Bitcoin way in regards to updating the protocol in order to have global neutral money.

[18:44] **kushti**: All the Bitcoin issues basically like scalability, bad support for certain constructions such as sidechains and security budget issues, absence of tail emission or demurrage. All those issues are fixed here, right? Yeah, well, in the long term, well, this protocol, the Ergo protocol doesn't have issues, right, but yeah, it's still global neutral kind of money, ultra-fixed money, as our demurrage wizard Luis is saying.

[19:33] **kushti**: And then, yeah, well, also on top of this global ultra-fixed money protocol, you can build other sorts of money, right, like having good money for everyone, so you're going to have stable coins right then tokenized real world assets well with insurance in form of algorithmic assets right so you can have tokenized physical gold secured with algorithmic gold stable coin based insurance then.

[20:18] **kushti**: Then, yeah, well, there are tools to get more assets from outside, from the real world, right, in the first place, but then also from other chains via different cross-chaining applications, such as Rosen, right? And then, yeah, well, with that, there are also tools, there will be tools to do monetary expansions, such as ChainCash. And I believe there is need maybe for other systems.

[20:52] **kushti**: Well, for example, to have off-chain peer-to-peer cash based on on-chain reserves, right? Or maybe even on-chain manifestation of trust, right? So we can imagine maybe in future even trusted issuers like Tether, right? Well, issuing notes in ChainCash on top of Ergo along with other entities which may have reserves right so on-chain reserves not trust blind trust that we basically have in case of Tether and so on right so well this is kind of global ultra fixed neutral money but also platform for producing more money via different forms of monetary expansion, right? That's some thoughts which I would like to share.

[22:02] **qx()**: I still can't wrap my head around off-chain exchange of these notes. How do you imagine that happening?

[22:11] **kushti**: Actually, I tried, well, I spent a few weeks, basically, I lost a few weeks back in 2023 trying to get one form of exchange of ChainCash notes. But the protocol got overly complicated, so at some point I just gave up because there were a lot of security issues on the way, and by resolving them I've got even more complex protocol with even more possible security issues, maybe.

[22:51] **kushti**: But recently what I realized by observing some other attempts like ARK on Bitcoin so you can have completely simplified protocol if exchange of considering totally trustless off-chain protocol you may assume payment servers in case of ARK off-chain payment solution for Bitcoin.

[23:28] **kushti**: It's called ARK payment server. You may have a federation instead, like maybe Rosen watchers even, to track the state of off-chain. You may use those guardians of off-chain states in on-chain protocols and then yeah then it should be hard so I don't have concrete contracts yet because I'm currently fixing some other issues in ChainCash contracts when I have spare time and I don't have it basically but yeah after fixing those issues I think to do another attempt and yeah it seems doable.

[24:30] **kushti**: As well it seems doable to do kind of ARK on top of Ergo and it would be simplified in opposite to the Bitcoin version and also in regards with Ergo so what I'm looking at is that you know you may have not just simple off-chain payments right like I'm just sending a payment to you just like some value rights, like 5 ERG rights off-chain.

[25:11] **kushti**: But there could be actually some off-chain contracts also with this. Well, some on-chain guarantees. Well, I believe I made one tweet on that. Yeah, one tweet probably or something like that. But yeah, at some point I will consider that carefully and write down details how could that be possible. And then you may have programmable off-chain cash backed by on-chain reserve. So basically, realizing the initial dream of Hal Finney, right?

[25:55] **kushti**: Not Satoshi maybe, but maybe Satoshi, if Hal Finney is a part of Satoshi's identity. So yeah, the idea was that, you know, if one ledger is not enough, maybe it would be just settlement layer rights for basically banks. And then those banks may have some protocols on top of that. And that was understood by many.

[26:31] **kushti**: Yeah, you know, blockchain is Bitcoin, at least, you know, would be just, you know, a network between traditional financial institutions, right? And then they will run Lightning Network channels with their respective clients, right, and so on. But I think it should be done differently, right? So we need to have kind of free banking network here. So peer-to-peer banking network where everyone may become a bank.

[27:11] **kushti**: And then, yeah, it should be covered by collateral rights or trust. So it's what we have to some degree, but yeah, it's now totally not formalized, right? And done it quite broken way. Like, most of the crypto industry is just blindly trusting Tether, right? While, you know, blaming it. So, it's kind of, I don't know, bipolar state of crypto when everyone is hating Tether and using USDT at the same time.

[27:54] **kushti**: I hate you, but I can't quit you.

[28:01] **Dan Friedman**: That sounds like a love story. You're so bad for me, but I can't quit you. I wish I could quit you. What was that line from that one movie that the QX told me to watch? Yeah, I wish I knew how to quit you. What is it?

[28:20] **qx()**: What is that from? I don't know.

[28:23] **Dan Friedman**: That's from Brokeback Mountain. It's a meme.

[28:25] **qx()**: Oh, it is. I wish I knew how to quit you. Yep. Yep. Yep. Great movie, Dan.

[28:30] **qx()**: kushti, speaking of P2P stuff, I saw some really cool, I think it was Reddit yesterday or the day before. Somebody was asking people to check out their app that they're developing, and they developed a reputation-based peer-to-peer on-ramp. So what it does is it connects people, it's just an app that connects people that want to buy Bitcoin in cash, it was for Bitcoin, to buy Bitcoin in cash and a meetup space as well as reputation. So I can understand that it's not a good idea probably to meet somebody with a wad full of cash to buy Bitcoin in a dark place, but I guess that's where he's trying to be.

[29:06] **Dan Friedman**: Isn't that the same with local Bitcoins though? Is that what it is there is something already like that bitcoins I don't know I mean it's probably still around but I remember back in what like 2016 or something like that oh I remember local Bitcoin back in 2012 yeah so it was I mean they were they were already around but for a while by then but I remember like 2015 2016 I used to use local bitcoins.

[29:30] **qx()**: Yeah, yeah. Was it reputation based?

[29:32] **kushti**: Yeah, yeah. So it had a rating and yeah, it was since, I don't know, 2011, 12. And yeah, but basically it got shut down. It's, I don't know, like by the government around late 2010s. Well, I don't know. It was a soft kind of shutdown. So, I had talks with the CTO basically back in 2015. And so back in 2015, so the hosting provider, Hetzner, got phone calls from banks informing that whether you are switching local bitcoins off or we are switching you from credit card processing.

[30:28] **kushti**: Yikes. But finally, they shut down themselves after some European regulation came into power, I believe. But yeah, they had few steps, I mean, becoming more and more shitty on the way, trying to be compliant, more and more compliant. And then, yeah, so they had some follow-ups such as Hoddle Hoddle which is also quite interesting because you're also using some escrow contracts like multi-signature based escrows and so on.

[31:02] **kushti**: And yeah, it's a bit popular in certain places as far as I know, but yeah, it's nothing near local bitcoins. Yeah, what was good about LocalBitcoins? So back then, liquidity on exchanges was quite crappy, right? Even on biggest ones like MtGox, BTC back in 2013, for example. So, it was hard to on-ramp, right?

[31:37] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah, yeah. Back then, it was super hard. I mean, because LocalBitcoins was actually out here in Japan. You know, as well, there was a, you know, you could find some people doing local Bitcoins, but yeah, it was, like, a lot of times it would price gouge because it was so difficult to on-ramp money for Bitcoin back then. Yeah, I mean, you know, even now with hodl hodl, they still try to, still try to bullshit you about that.

[32:08] **Dan Friedman**: So like once in a while you actually find somebody who just wants to trade, you know, he wants to like, okay, I got some, whatever, I'll buy some crypto from you or I'll sell you some crypto or something like that. And they'll just basically do it at whatever the rate is. But then there's the people that do it for a living. And I get paying a somewhat of a premium, but some of these guys want like 10%.

[32:37] **Dan Friedman**: And then they give you some bullshit about it. I was like, oh, well, you know, a cash, it's something really stupid, like cash is difficult to come by right now for Bitcoin. I'm like, no, it's not. What are you talking about? No, it's not. It's not difficult at all.

[32:52] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah, so it's like HODL HODL is actually pretty OK. But it's still like there's not like sometimes you'll find somebody to trade with right away and you'll find somebody good. But many times like a limited amount of times you'll find somebody really good. Most of the times you'll find somebody who does it for a living and they'll want to get at least five to ten percent commission from you. I mean, I think that's okay.

[33:22] **qx()**: There's a premium to pay for it on KYC nowadays I think there's a market for that 10% really.

[33:27] **Dan Friedman**: Oh, yeah, I hear you. They turn right around and sell it at an exchange. I mean 10%. Yeah. And no, it's like, I remember a few, I mean, I like, okay, I'd pay a few percent, but not 10%. And 10% is obnoxious. Especially if you're trading, I mean, it's like, okay, you're trading like some small amount or something. Still not okay, but you know, it's doable. But if you're asking somebody to, you know, to do 10% on like a $10,000 purchase, that's a thousand bucks. I'm not gonna pay a thousand bucks for that. For what? For having some money on hand? I mean, and it's not even that much money, so. Anyway.

[34:05] **qx()**: I mean, we could do something like, kushti, we could do something like this on Ergo with once messaging is in place, you could build a dApp that's self-hosted so nobody can shut it down with, you know, a special format of putting those peer-to-peer on-ramps on-chain in a messaging block and just do it that way. You could build that on-chain.

[34:26] **kushti**: Yeah, well, it was proposed by HQx to use, unsurprisingly, MewFinance, so they have some escrow contracts. And so, yeah, I'm actually willing to try them. I don't know. I need to check escrow contracts and we need to think actually how to use. So, yeah, I believe a lot of tooling is already there, right, on Ergo. It's just time to actually use it and find different use cases for tooling available.

[35:04] **kushti**: All right, and yeah, checking the charts. Yeah, that is a good reminder from CannonQ. So more than 27,000 ERG in bounties are available for developers to earn and move projects and ecosystem forward.

[35:29] **kushti**: There is link in the chat. I've posted the link also just like one hour ago or like that in the main group and yeah some other groups and yeah it's also posting Ergo developers and so on so yeah developers we have more than 27,000 ERG in bounties in different projects and yeah in different form also so it's not just ERG so there are bounties in the ChainCash repository denominated in Gluon.

[36:04] **kushti**: There are some bounties in Rosen repositories, denominated in RSN, unsurprisingly. Then there are GORT, Gluon Oracle reward token denominated bounties. I believe still there are some in Oracle repository and maybe some other repos.

[36:30] **kushti**: There are some issues in Ergo repository, so protocol client, reference protocol client repository, denominated in Gluon also so Gluon-based gold stablecoin and so on so yeah a lot of things going on so then when can we pay bounties to developers in lithium that would be funny it's the gold of 21st century right?

[37:01] **Dan Friedman**: Would be happy, actually. Yeah, for the lithium-backed stablecoin. Yeah, that's actually in development right now. Yeah, after we have the initial... We're actually talking to the same tokenomics team that did our tokenomics zero one X. And they're the ones that also did the tokenomics for world mobile. So it's a really good, it's a really good tokenomics firm. There are partners.

[37:51] **Dan Friedman**: And so we're going to, you know, I guess, and also we'll plug you in and we'll talk about initial kind of initial groundwork for this because like they have, they have a token right now on either ether polygon. I can't remember exactly, but I think it was polygon. But we were thinking about bringing it over, but we might just have to do a swap for the holders over there because we probably just need to build it from scratch to make sure that it does what it's supposed to do.

[38:31] **Dan Friedman**: But we'll see. Yeah, but very soon we'll be able to do that. Very soon.

[38:37] **kushti**: Right nice because yeah I think tokenized commodities as well as cross-chain assets is what's needed right for producing different and good kinds of money on top of Ergo. And also to build the different DeFi and so on.

[39:04] **Dan Friedman**: That's the thing. Legacy financial markets aren't just built on the stock market and the bond market, but they're also built on commodity market by a huge, huge part. Price of gold, price of silver, price of copper, all this stuff as a big influence on other prices, price of oil, and just economy in general.

[39:31] **Dan Friedman**: So if we are going to be kind of the antithesis of that market by doing it in a decentralized way, we still need to maintain some of the same basic principles of just how markets work. You know, like money needs to be backed by something at some point. And I mean, you know, and say in some cases it is hashrate, you know, some cases it is computing power. So that's also a commodity, you know, of its own. But that comes from a commodity called, you know, electric power or energy.

[40:07] **kushti**: Yeah, exactly. So it's energy-based money, basically.

[40:11] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah, exactly. So it's still a commodity, so even with mining Ergo, you're literally still in a commodity-based financial system. But it's just a different. Yeah, but we just need to have other ones as well. We need to have lithium, we need to have gold, we need to have other metals and commodities that are essentials. Yeah, absolutely needed.

[40:39] **kushti**: Yeah, and then, you know, so the point is then, yeah, other forms of money such as stable coins like the USDT and so on, so that they should be... I mean, commodities are really irreplaceable in many ways.

[41:11] **Dan Friedman**: Just the same with, you know, with gold. I mean, why is gold still so popular? I mean, obviously, you know, it's not used for making coins anymore as much, but it's still a hot commodity. And that's kind of the, you know, the nature of a truly base commodity like that because even now that OK, we might back something with it. Why do we back something with it? Because it still has. Obviously, internationally, the world agreed on value. That's number one. Number two, it still has high utility.

[41:55] **Dan Friedman**: Even if you're not making coins from it, like, say, back several hundred years ago, you had gold coins people were paying with. Now, you use it in electronics just as much. In fact, right now, I would say gold is more of an industrial metal than than a jewelry precious metal. Again, I don't know the statistics for that, but it seems like the utility of gold in electronics probably outweighs the utility of gold in jewelry and just in its raw form for monetary, for hedging value.

[42:33] **Dan Friedman**: That's it. 500 years ago, who would have known that gold would be supporting electronic circuitry? And the same circuitry that's actually being used to mine Ergo right now. You need gold for that. I mean, it's one of its unique properties that it doesn't oxidize. So, yeah, so that's yeah, it's it's like that. And it's like that across the board. And I think if we want to have a really a thriving system, we need to adopt that. We are adopting it as an ecosystem and Ergo, you know, we have Gluon.

[43:05] **Dan Friedman**: We're talking about algorithmic commodities, which are actually really interesting as well to explore. We might even see later down the line to do a fully algorithmic lithium-backed stablecoin after we establish the Oracle network for what we're doing. So yeah, quite a lot of possibilities.

[43:28] **kushti**: Yeah. And actually, I had a talk with Anon Real recently. So he made the pronouncement on Twitter already. So he's working on index funds. So then you may have for lithium, which is like 20% algorithmic and 80% physical, or whatever, 50-50. So that's also quite interesting.

[43:53] **Dan Friedman**: A lot of interesting stuff going on. Yeah, we should see something really soon. So I think the community is going to be really happy once we have some news coming out. But anyway, guys, listen, unfortunately, I have to drop off right now.

[44:09] **kushti**: What about questions?

[44:11] **Dan Friedman**: Well, I mean...

[44:14] **qx()**: Ducking the questions. Classic Dan.

[44:15] **Dan Friedman**: You guys can do the questions. Well, get QX to do something. He hasn't been really doing much.

[44:21] **kushti**: All right, so we have 15 minutes for questions, actually.

[44:24] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah, yeah, guys. Guys, stay on. QX is going to answer all your questions. Alex, you're in charge.

[44:31] **kushti**: Yeah, so then I will message you after, but maybe tomorrow because it's late, right? On your side, sir.

[44:40] **Dan Friedman**: Yeah, yeah. Well, we still have a space in about an hour. So yeah, it's okay. It's okay. But anyway.

[44:46] **kushti**: All right. So yeah, let's discuss.

[44:49] **Dan Friedman**: Thank you guys. Yeah, thank you.

[44:52] **qx()**: Bye, Dan.

[44:54] **Dan Friedman**: Bye, QX.

[44:56] **qx()**: So, oh, that's, there we go. Andy's got to fix our pictures. Let me sit up so people can see us. There we go. Well, I'll talk while he's fixing this. So hey, kushti, I introduced, yesterday was Wednesday, right, Tuesday, I introduced Cornell BRICK to, goodness, maybe 300, 400 students, the entire architecture classes, and then some of our remote students in New York City.

[45:28] **qx()**: It was an interesting response. The initial response, I think I saw some eye rolls when I discussed that we were integrating blockchain tech into our stuff. And then I went on to explain a little more about a system of trade value between peer-to-peer people and a LETS system, what we're trying to do. And then their eyes lit up when they realized they could use these tokens for credits for free plotting, for free large format printing initially. So that got their attention. So right now, the system's all set up.

[46:02] **qx()**: I have the Tipperbot set up. I have my front end and back end of the plot submission stuff all set up to take the Ergo payments for BRICK and so that's ready to go and tested we just have to work on a little bit of a tutorial to show kids how to we've written text but these guys like are visual so just need to make a quick video on how to request or get a tipper bot wallet and then we'll either probably just tip out manually for now or once that happens perhaps do an airdrop if we can get kids to get their own address and actually know what they're doing that's.

[46:40] **qx()**: I think they'll be better off with Tipper Bot in the long run, but we'll see. So that's pretty cool coming up. The funny thing is, kushti, in the small group that I was discussing this with, one of the kids raised their hand and was like, can we collect this and sell this? And I was like, well, it's permissionless, because you can do whatever the hell you want. But if I find this token on a DEX and it has some system of monetary value on it, that may have some more tax implications that I'm willing to deal with.

[47:11] **qx()**: So I may just nuke the coin by reissuing another one and airdropping it to everybody that holds the old one. So we'll see what happens. Hopefully it doesn't end up on a DEX anywhere with a value attached to it.

[47:26] **kushti**: Yeah, but you know, so what's good about, you know, that's a permissionless finance, you know, I mean, like, like totally permissionless. So, it's easy, you know, to try to find market value, right, if any. And then, yeah, we may expect people to try to find market value. Then, yeah, I mean, you can try to sell anything. The question is who will buy it, right?

[48:01] **kushti**: All right. So, yeah, let's jump on questions. What do we have?

[48:12] **kushti**: Oh, a lot of messages, but there are other questions. Hi, just two basic questions, please. What is the basic difference between Ergo simple send transaction process? And why smart contracts are possible on Ergo and not on Bitcoin. I mean difference between Ergo and Bitcoin. So yeah, I see only one question here, right? So difference between Ergo and Bitcoin actually.

[48:37] **qx()**: Well, the first, I guess the first one's he's asking if there's a difference between send and receive transactions, which there's not there. You just making new boxes all the time between send and receive. It's all about destroying boxes and creating new boxes with permissions for certain keys to access those boxes or ownership of those boxes. That's all send and receive is with UTXO, so that's easy. Sorry, kushti, go ahead and answer the second part.

[49:01] **kushti**: Yeah, so basically a transaction is about, well, destroying old programmable digital monitoring notes, right, and creating new ones, right, so there is no send and receive, right, if we are taking it on this low level. And then, yeah, difference between Ergo and Bitcoin and contracts. So in the first place, Bitcoin is allowing for contracts, actually, right, there were lots of proposals for Bitcoin and theoretically there are a lot of contracts on Bitcoin utilizing different techniques actually.

[49:46] **kushti**: Yeah, in the first place, what's good? So, everything possible on Bitcoin is also possible on Ergo, right? So no exceptions found to the moment. So multi signatures, what else? Discrete lock contracts. Then, yeah, adapter signature based how's it called? Atomic swaps, yeah. And then, yeah, simple hash-based atomic swaps. Yeah, so everything is possible on Ergo and Bitcoin, right? But, well...

[50:26] **kushti**: Lightning Network channels, other layer 2 solutions, so they are possible. But Ergo is allowing for a lot more because more blockchain context is available during transaction validation. There are certain proposals for Bitcoin to be closer to Ergo rights as such as exposing spending transaction to spending script of transaction input but yet still not there.

[51:14] **kushti**: Then yeah, so simply a richer context and then more opcodes and also, more sophisticated cryptography, right, if you're talking about Sigma protocols. So you can easily do things which are hardly doable or nearly impossible on Bitcoin so for example there is Ergo Mixer right which is non-interactive non-custodial mixer and for Bitcoin there was a proposal using a bit similar cryptography actually yeah quite similar called CoinJoin but yeah it was interactive in the first place so there was need for some peer-to-peer based bulletin board, right, for mixer related messages.

[52:09] **kushti**: And then, yeah, it also was quite hard to implement, so there was some startup, but, well, no delivery still. And, yeah, six years actually passed since the original CoinJoin proposal. So, Ergo Mixer proposal, the protocol appeared around the same time actually so 2018 right it was when I came to the idea developing. So Alex had some thoughts, but his initial construction was based on non-existing cryptographic primitive.

[52:55] **kushti**: So I made a practical solution, then sent it to Professor Rezin. And yes, some modifications and then one of them was implemented back in 2020, right? So just months basically after the main net launch. And yes, for Bitcoin CoinJoin still there is no implementation. Yeah, probably would never be. So, yeah, that's the difference. So, in short, contracts, a lot of contracts also possible in Bitcoin, but in practice, we see only multi-signatures and multi-signatures also different on Ergo, more feature-rich.

[53:45] **kushti**: And, yeah, Lightning Network, which is not so popular for Bitcoin even still, I guess. And so, yeah, it's not implemented by anyone on top of Ergo. Still.

[54:03] **qx()**: Well, I think just from an outside perspective, not outside, but a general easy perspective to point to, right? And part of what you said, right, is that Ergo uses the eUTXO set, extended UTXO, as opposed to Bitcoin, just UTXO. So as you said in your dialogue there, that Ergo has a much more opportunity for more feature-rich contracts built into that with that extended UTXO set.

[54:31] **qx()**: Making really cool things like escrow contracts like you said the mixer like what MewFinance is doing with our LP fundraising all those kind of things it makes for a very robust library of smart contracts you can create compared to your limitations on Bitcoin, so I think the easy thing to think of is Ergo is kind of like Bitcoin on steroids or Bitcoin 4.0 or 5.0. I don't want to say 2.0 because I think it's more than 2.0, kushti.

[55:15] **kushti**: Around the main net launch so Cardano presented it as Bitcoin 1.0 because you know the Bitcoin is still about 0.20. His idea was that it's kind of like finished Bitcoin, so Bitcoin 1.0, which may be seen in decades if we are talking about the grandfather. So, yeah, they're just starting to discuss, possibility of demurrage, tail emissions, and, yeah, maybe they will spend, like, five to seven years in another civil war on that.

[56:01] **qx()**: Let's see. I mean, there's that advantage about Ergo, how fast things can pivot.

[56:08] **kushti**: Yeah, Ergo was made kind of complete, right, like Bitcoin 1.0 since day one. And yeah, happily, it was flexible enough to allow for non-breaking protocol updates. But yeah, actually Bitcoin is also quite good at that. Well, what the developers did, like SegWit and Taproot, so yeah, they are pure acts of art of software capability, let's say.

[56:46] **kushti**: All right, more questions?

[56:51] **qx()**: Let's see, we've got one. Oh, somebody's asking about quantum processors again. I know you spoke about this before, but yeah.

[57:01] **kushti**: So, nothing changed since the AMA. So, but, but yeah, it seems dust settled, right? So crypto is still standing. Yeah, working and people now seem not worrying so much, right? But yeah, there is need to consider something.

[57:29] **qx()**: We got somebody, Luke's asking about the same comparison between Ethereum smart contracts and Ergo smart contracts. Do you have the bandwidth to talk about that, kushti?

[57:41] **kushti**: Yeah, but if we are talking about Ethereum, so Ethereum is actually totally different, right? So Bitcoin is following a programmable money paradigm of Bitcoin, and Ethereum is actually quite a different beast. So yeah, it's how they call it, a decentralized world computer. But yeah, it's more like a replicated programmable calculator, right? So very limited, kind of computational device. Everyone in the world has access to.

[58:20] **kushti**: And so, yeah, they tried to sell initially I know like yet decentralized computer for all kinds of applications on the blockchain so that that was the time especially back in 2016-17 when yeah the space finally got full with, you know, enterprise evangelists, talking the same mantra, basically, not Bitcoin, but blockchain. And the idea was that, you don't need for those, you know, risky uncontrollable peer to peer money.

[59:08] **kushti**: So while you, yeah, that's control. Decentralized applications like decentralized Uber, I don't know why you need for decentralized Uber, I mean who needs for decentralized Uber? Who actually may care even? I mean who cares? I mean if taxi is coming from centralized server or decentralized and also how do you measure this decentralization? So if that's, I don't know, decentralized Uber is controlled by a few whales, right, and decentralized Uber, how is it different from board of directors, right, and centralized and so on.

[59:49] **kushti**: But yeah, I mean, it's still alive, I believe, but now in even worse form. So Web3, right, so when, you know, I mean, people are talking about Web3 projects, so I think it's like grandsons of that initial wave of absurd. But yeah, it's now like complete absurd, so usually when you listen about Web3 project, you may be sure, I mean, it's pretty meaningless.

[60:20] **kushti**: All right, and so, going back to Ethereum, so, with time, all the applications on Ethereum, after all, are financial, right? And then the question is why to build general purpose world computer, right, which is still working on financial applications on the right. And so that actually was the Ergo value proposition. That was our statement, better to say, back in 2016-17, even, right?

[60:56] **kushti**: So it's a counteraction to all that's not Bitcoin, but blockchain absurd. So, I say it pretty clearly back then that, you know, blockchain is totally inefficient database, right? And, there is very little hope it would
