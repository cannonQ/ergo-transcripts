# Ergo Community Call Summary: CodeUTXO Project

**Call Date:** 2025-06-25  
**Call Title:** CodeUTXO | Marc the Shark & cannon_q | ErgoHack 10

## Executive Summary

Marc the Shark and CannonQ presented CodeUTXO, an innovative AI-powered platform designed to revolutionize Ergo blockchain development by making it accessible through natural language interfaces. The project addresses the steep learning curve in Ergo development by providing AI-powered tools that can interact with blockchain data, documentation, and smart contracts without requiring deep technical knowledge of APIs. Built during ErgoHack 10 with significant backend contributions from qx(), CodeUTXO features a sustainable pay-per-use credit system accepting ERG and native tokens, along with modular MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers that can be expanded by the community.

The platform demonstrated impressive capabilities during the live demo, including real-time blockchain queries, price data analysis with visualization, token holder analysis, and transaction examination. The team emphasized their commitment to community-driven development, with open-source MCP servers and plans to enable community members to create and monetize their own tools within the ecosystem.

## Key Discussion Points

- **AI-Powered Blockchain Interaction**: Natural language queries to Ergo node APIs without technical knowledge requirements
- **Modular Architecture**: MCP servers for different functions (blockchain queries, price data) that can be easily expanded
- **Sustainable Pricing Model**: Pay-per-use credits starting from 1-2 ERG, supporting multiple native tokens with transparent usage tracking
- **Community-Focused Development**: Open-source MCP servers, community contribution opportunities, and revenue-sharing possibilities
- **Technical Stack**: OpenWebUI interface, LiteLLM for model management, GPT-4 integration with plans for multiple LLM options
- **Future Roadmap**: Trading agents, DeFi integration, advanced analytics, and expansion to other UTXO chains
- **Live Demonstrations**: Real-time blockchain queries, price charting, token holder analysis, and transaction examination
- **Development Accessibility**: Claims of 10x faster development times through AI-assisted blockchain interaction

## Decisions Made

- MCP servers will be released as open-source tools for community contribution
- Platform will expand to support multiple LLM models (Gemini, Claude variants)
- Community members can create their own MCP servers and potentially earn revenue shares
- Token payment system includes markup for non-ERG tokens (10% for major tokens, 20% for community tokens)
- Future expansion planned for other UTXO blockchain ecosystems beyond Ergo

## Notable Quotes

> "We're revolutionizing blockchain development with AI, making Ergo development accessible to everyone through AI power tools and natural language interfaces." - **Marc the Shark**

> "The way we've set this up, what it allows us to do is basically you can buy credits as little as like basically one ERG or two ERG worth of credits... your credits don't die. So it's fair, it's transparent, and you don't have to pay out like a monthly subscription." - **CannonQ**

> "We're trying to figure out how to make it a community effort, not us driving the ship the whole time." - **CannonQ**

## Participants
