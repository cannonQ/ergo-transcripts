# Ergo Blockchain Community Call Summary

**Date:** October 27, 2024  
**Title:** Wallet Wonderland | ErgoMinnow | ErgoHack 9

## Executive Summary

ErgoMinnow presented the results of the "Ergo Wallet Wonderland" project, an ErgoHack 9 submission created in collaboration with CannonQ. The project surveyed 113 Sigmanauts to analyze the current wallet ecosystem on Ergo and identify features needed for the "ultimate Ergo wallet." The comprehensive 35-page report evaluated six major Ergo wallets (Nautilus, SafeW, Minotaur, Satergo, Ergo Mobile, and Paper Wallet) and found that while users are generally satisfied with current options, significant improvements are desired.

The survey revealed that Nautilus and Ergo Mobile are the most popular wallets, valued primarily for their ease of use. However, key missing features include transaction history, in-wallet token swaps, mixer integration, and official Ledger support without dev mode requirements. The project aims to serve as a centralized resource for wallet information and will be expanded over the next 8-10 weeks to help guide future wallet development in the Ergo ecosystem.

## Key Discussion Points

• **Survey Results**: 113 Sigmanauts completed a comprehensive wallet survey covering user preferences and desired features

• **Top Wallets**: Nautilus and Ergo Mobile identified as most widely used and highest-rated wallets

• **Critical Missing Features**: 
  - Transaction history (most requested)
  - In-wallet token swaps
  - Mixer integration
  - Official Ledger support without dev mode

• **User Priorities**: Easy-to-use interface ranked as the most important wallet feature by overwhelming majority

• **Hardware Wallet Issues**: Community distrust of Ledger's dev mode/sideload requirement creating barriers to adoption

• **Documentation Resource**: Project created centralized hub with tutorials, documentation, and feature comparisons for all major Ergo wallets

## Decisions Made

• The project team will expand their findings over the next 8-10 weeks to create a comprehensive wallet resource

• The 35-page document will be published for community and developer reference

• The project will serve as a centralized information source for newcomers to understand Ergo wallet options

## Notable Quotes

> "I think this would probably change the wallet game, I think, in crypto... the fact that Ergo's mixer is open source, I think, is kind of different too. So I think it'd be even more beneficial on an Ergo wallet because you'd have an open source wallet and you'd have an open source mixer." - **ErgoMinnow** on mixer integration

> "I feel like it's a good thing to be paranoid in crypto because this industry is really shady. So that needs to be tackled because the overall community is not trusting the sideload or the dev mode." - **ErgoMinnow** on Ledger hardware wallet concerns

> "I think in crypto, or even on Ergo, our front end is probably what's lacking the most. If we can make it just easier to use... an easy to use interface, so wallet devs, this is what the people want." - **ErgoMinnow** on user interface priorities
