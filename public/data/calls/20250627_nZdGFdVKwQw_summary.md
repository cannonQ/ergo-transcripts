# Ergo PoW Blockchain - Weekly Update & AMA Summary
**Date:** June 27, 2025 (Call dated June 26th)

## Executive Summary

This community call focused primarily on the successful release of Ergo's 6.0 and 6.1 node updates, with core developer kushti providing technical details about the upcoming soft fork voting process. The conversation highlighted Ergo's commitment to its founding principles over six years, with particular emphasis on fair distribution and avoiding centralized exchange dependencies through innovations like the Rosen Bridge.

The call also covered preparations for Ergoversary (July 1st), upcoming ErgoHack video releases, and discussions about the challenges fair-launch projects face with centralized exchanges versus the opportunities provided by cross-chain bridging solutions.

## Key Discussion Points

• **Node Updates (6.0/6.1)**: Successful deployment with no downtime; voting begins around July 11-12th
• **Soft Fork Requirements**: 90%+ miner agreement needed to avoid chain splits (vs 50% for non-critical parameters)
• **Sub-blocks Feature**: Expected activation around October if voting succeeds; 5.x nodes will ignore sub-blocks
• **SIGS Mining Pool**: Testing new storage rent builds on testnet; positioned as experimental platform
• **Rosen Bridge Impact**: Enabling free blockchain launches with day-one cross-chain liquidity
• **Ergoversary Preparations**: Special AMA planned for July 1st with kushti, qx(), Joe, and Dan
• **ErgoHack Content**: Videos being released showcasing AI-focused development projects
• **Exchange Challenges**: Discussion of fair-launch projects' difficulties with centralized exchanges preferring centralized token supplies

## Decisions Made

• Special Ergoversary AMA scheduled for July 1st with four core team members
• SIGS mining pool to test 6.0 node builds for storage rent functionality
• Continued focus on Rosen Bridge development for cross-chain accessibility

## Notable Quotes

> **kushti**: "So, yes, centralized exchanges love that [VC rugpulls] and getting back to the initial point... nowadays you can launch a blockchain and the only thing you need is basically the Rosen Bridge integration rights, and you can do it for free."

> **qx()**: "I think it is commendable and it speaks to Ergo how in six years it's only gotten stronger and it's resolved of what it is and how it functions and what it's supposed to be."

> **kushti**: "Well, it's truly Ergo-oriented, so we can try some new things with Sigmanauts in the first place. Well, with 6.0 there will be better support for sidechains, including trustless two-way pegged merge mined sidechains."
