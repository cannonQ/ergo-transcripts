      "asker": "kushti",
      "answer": "I acquired Crux to develop it as a platform for use. I want people visiting Ergo first to visit Crux Finance, but I'll make it use-centric with use as the main trading pair. I'll build a bank monitor there so people can see how bank reserves behave over time to give confidence that use is fully collateralized.",
