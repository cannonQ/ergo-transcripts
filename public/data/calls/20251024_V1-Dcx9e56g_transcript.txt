[03:20] **qx**: I'll take the blame if it is. Yeah, I don't hear any sound on the YouTube. Let's give it a second. Grayman entered, let's allow Grayman in while Andy's fixing the sound. Let me hit live here. Let's see.

[03:50] **qx**: Unmute. Yeah, yeah, we are here, we're good, we're live. All right, back to - oh no problem Andy, we're gonna flog you after the show. All right, starting again.

[04:04] **qx**: Good morning everybody. Welcome to the Ergo AMA. We have kushti, Benzel, and Grayman with us this morning. You saw us go through the visual of the Ergo update. We hit it all, actually. There's three updates this morning. So I'm sure you read it exactly as we were saying it. You probably read it in kushti's voice, right?

[04:28] **kushti**: Actually, sorry. Yeah, hello everyone. Because yeah, it seems greetings also miss. So yeah, also yes, him is a game of proms. So yeah, also. Oh, what do you see that was down here? It's about for Lisa sexually.

[04:46] **qx**: Oh nice. I haven't finished the contracts in front in for game of proms yet. Just sharing a tell you a few weeks ago.

[04:51] **kushti**: Oh, yeah, so there is telegram group where game of proms can be discussed and I love it. It doesn't really have any use at the moment, but if anyone's interested, feel free to use it.

[05:03] **qx**: Nice Josephine, that's awesome. Yeah, and back to Lithos as well. Guys, if you haven't seen the videos, I split up all seven or eight videos from the Ergo meetup. I ran them through AI and got summaries and bookmarks and all that kind of goodness and put those in the description of YouTube and I posted them in a series in YouTube in a grouping so you can go to that whole group. Joe starts it off and then I think I didn't pay attention to the order after that, but Joe starts it off and then everybody else is after that. But if you have a chance go see the Lithos chat - that was a very popular, very popular talk. Cheese always does an amazing job breaking things down simply so you can understand him. And he's got that ASMR cheese voice, which is fantastic.

[05:52] **qx**: So check that out. Also with Lithos I believe they will need some test net people firing up their rigs in November at some point. So that's really exciting to see that going. Amazing. All right, let's kill the dev update here. What is the news today, guys?

[06:08] **qx**: We've got some big news in the crypto sphere, right, lately. And kushti's coined a term for the season. kushti, what's your term for the season?

[06:20] **kushti**: So it's the rug season.

[06:23] **qx**: The rug season. Oh, man, you know, with I think something the other week too I forget what it was. Oh, Amazon, right? Going down and this kind of stuff happening. It really shows how important real decentralization and peer to peer networks are for resiliency, right?

[06:51] **kushti**: Right. Yeah, but now we have like, so yeah, this Amazon outage. Yeah, it's showing well, kind of decentralization we have, right.

[07:09] **qx**: Yeah, it's like Amazon's a canary in the coal mine there, right? You don't know who's attached to it until it actually dies. Then you're like, oh, really? You know, your entire back end was relying on the centralized service, you know, kind of thing. The only thing we noticed is the same day one of our load balancers for Cloudflare was banning one of our redirects for the GraphQL. I don't know if it was related or not, but it doesn't matter. It's fixed momentarily with that. But yeah, really, really telling, I'd say, of the industry for those kind of hangups there. And about Kadena, man, that's absolutely bonkers, eh?

[07:51] **kushti**: I think it's expected, actually, and we should expect from all that. Actually, for many years, well, over the span of many years, it's now kind of standard, right? When we have a blockchain, which is run by a single company without community, basically, or with fake community, right? Which is basically existing only as mercenaries right? So some I don't know well projects which are only milking grants around, then yeah paid shillers and so on. But well, it's all working right when the markets are fine, but well, if they are not, then we see what we saw like yesterday, right?

[09:03] **kushti**: So, well, and we will see more of that. So all those, well, company owns blockchains, well, whether they will transition to community control, but it's very unlikely, right, so one control is grabbed. There is a little chance to become normal. And then the second option is it would die probably. So, well, it would be good to help the Kadena community, but yeah, we're the first place. We need to find their community, right? So, I joined their group just like yesterday. And yeah, well, I haven't seen any seeds, you know, of community action.

[10:03] **kushti**: So, for example, back in 2016, when we had Ethereum, proof of work, proof of stake. No, it wasn't. Yeah. So it was, these, the DAO hack rights and yeah, chain owners had chosen to roll back the chain, right? After selling, the court is low. And then, yeah, there was active community disagreement, right? And that's how Ethereum Classic got appeared. But then, even, no, it was like a few days maybe after Ethereum Classic was born. So me and Charles Hoskinson, so we appeared on some podcasts and defended the Ethereum Classic.

[11:13] **kushti**: So yeah, but back then it had just a few supporters around the world. And yeah, well, now it's doing quite well, more or less, I believe, right? But yeah, back then it wasn't quite clear whether it will survive coming weeks or not. But yeah, well, we got some traction around. Yeah, well, these days it's much worse. So basically we have all those companies controlling blockchains and then crowds running from one blockchain to another while waiting for pumps, right? And then usually they got scammed everywhere. Then yeah, well, running away from the whole space, claiming that crypto is scam. I mean, of course it's scam if you are well, chasing scams. So no, no, no, no surprise here.

[12:30] **kushti**: So, yeah, basically, no any community action. I witnessed just some shilling. Yeah, you're usually done by the same company, blockchains, right? The shillers, maybe paid shillers mostly. So that they just shoot the same company block chains in the Kadena group. And yeah, the shilling was like just trust me, bro. So I mean, well you're saying they're shilling new block chains in the Kadena group that you saw? Some existing some existing block chains, but from what I've seen here on only the same company owns rights. And yeah, the shilling was basically like, trust me, bro. So I mean, like, then our team was bad, but our team is good. Trust me bro, all that nonsense. I would be surprised if anyone is buying that in 2025.

[13:47] **qx**: Yeah, you will be prepared to be surprised, right? Once you're used to those kind of things, trust me bro as part of being part of a community to be part of the exit liquidity or just be there to bolster the price of a project. It's a quite different experience than being part of a community of something that you believe in that's going to make a difference and is fair in all those matters. It's much harder, I would say, to do what we're doing here with Ergo and what you've done with Ergo over the many, many years to build that community and have that community stick around as opposed to somebody that doesn't, and it's centrally run, and decisions are always coming from the top instead of, you know, from the bottom up or the side out kind of thing. So it really becomes apparent in situations like these where, you know, the top crinkles and dies, and then was there ever a root system to actually sustain new growth? So, I mean, that's a question, yeah.

[14:54] **kushti**: Yeah, so then what can we do here? I think, well, if some community action would be seen, so, well, what can we propose is to switch from ASIC mining to ASIC resistant, right? So basically, Autolykos, and in this case, we would have trustless pegging with Kadena, which would be good for Kadena as well right. So now it seems to be a smaller blockchain well by market cap probably not only right because well if the chain would survive well so somehow something would then yeah, well, it would be small, right? Because, well, I mean, this company, Blockchains, it seems, yeah, I mean, they're always talking about good tech, good tech, but when you know that the company is disappearing, no one is interested in good tech. And that's quite clear in this Kadena case, right?

[16:11] **qx**: Yeah, there are 20 million market cap right now, unfortunately for them. Yeah, that's rough.

[16:16] **kushti**: Yeah, so CannonQ told our telegram that they raised 200 million, was it? Yeah, so absolutely bonkers, where's that go? Where's it? Where is that where to go salaries?

[16:30] **qx**: Where is that where to go salaries? Maybe next time in Las Vegas, you can do some search around under the couch cushions at the Bellagio by accident.

[16:50] **qx**: Yeah. Oh gosh, yeah, it's interesting. You know you sit back and you think you know, what would what would Ergo be right now if the community was given money for development funds beyond that kind of thing that much at least? That'd be absolutely insane. I think I think you guys have quoted and Joe's quoted many times that the number one expense in Ergo has been exchange listings. Yeah, it's like 70 percent maybe of all the time and most of that's wasted, actually.

[17:24] **kushti**: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Done. Wasted. I mean, even before, so from exchanges I got listed back in 2019, only probate, I guess still alive. So heartbeat disappeared. Yep. And well for others I don't remember their names even well so some were free some not but yeah basically most of 2019 expenses just disappeared somewhere with those well guys, let's say politely. Then, yeah, well, other listings, yeah, basically. So, yeah, the biggest article and yeah, well, also our long period quite useless after all, right? But well, we did what was requested by community after all. That's what I can say.

[18:48] **qx**: Yeah, a lot of community feel that that kind of access is necessary. But honestly, I think we're at a, not a crossroads, but I think we're at a parallel intersection, if that makes sense. I think still the people who are interested in a project like Ergo, fair launch, peer-to-peer, decentralized, may be running parallel with us because those people that are actually interested pretty much should know how to access us, right? I'd say the people that are jumping on chain right now for things like corporately centralized projects through central exchanges, that's maybe more their cup of tea. I think we're still a bit away from the overall adoption of, you know, slowly, slowly you can see that kind of thing eroding, but it's interesting.

[19:39] **qx**: You see, in my eyes, I see this corporate structure of crypto, like half of Solana going down when Amazon goes out. I see things erode, right? You see these central entities erode, but in the end it also reveals those central entities that can continue to sustain and stand up because they have so much money pumped at them. So instead of this large island of centralized bullshit, now instead you have maybe several pillars of huge tall skyscrapers of these centralized bullshits. And so there's less of them, yeah, but there's still main strong ones that are there and in your face. So it's not like, I don't feel like, you know, while we're losing these, you know, as it goes along, which is great, it's the big ones are still going to get taller and taller. So it's not, we're always going to have that to deal with, I believe, and always fight against, in my opinion.

[20:37] **qx**: Everybody else asleep? Grayman? HQ? Benzel? They're all great here. Here we go.

[20:50] **Grayman**: He's awake. I am awake. I'm here. I love the rents. I'm in agreement with with everything that you've said so far. I got into crypto late and fortunately landed in Ergo via Cardano and the eloquent Mr. Hoskinson.

[21:10] **qx**: Cardano is a gateway drug to Ergo. He should make a t-shirt.

[21:17] **Grayman**: Well, so I think I managed to, you know, Bitcoin, Cardano and, and Ergo, I think I managed to avoid corporate scams, but there's a phrase that I used to hear a lot back in the day. I mean, we've been talking about this shit for years. It's not like this is a new thing. What was the regulatory arbitrage? And essentially the concept being that if you want to make a bunch of money by being a scammer, you're going to have to do that in a way that is not regulated by the current system. And so what do we have? We have Binance owning effectively 70% of the transaction base of the industry or something like that, something way over 50%. And where are they even based at this point? Like they've hopped around.

[22:08] **Grayman**: I mean, the chair of the board, I guess, CZ, spent some time in the US jail. I'm not sure about all the details of that stuff. I know he's free now, but it's just a mess. I mean, this is anything but decentralized, especially if you're keeping your coins on their exchange. But also in terms of the way that they control the order book and the flow of transactions, it's crazy that people think of this as crypto and get excited about it. And that's sort of like another trading account, another exchange for them. And it's their favorite one because it's totally lawless. But then the end result is that 95% of people get completely rugged, especially the ones that engage in any kind of leverage trading, because somebody else is running the train, and they say when it stops and goes, not you, and it's not about guessing, it's about them maximizing their profit, and it's a corporation, guys, and it's not a well-regulated corporation.

[23:21] **Grayman**: So to me, it's insane to watch all this happen. I think it's going to get worse, unfortunately.

[23:27] **qx**: Yes, such huge transfers of wealth happening, you know, with these dips and these shorts and everything. Absolutely mind boggling how much money is transferring to more wealthy people here.

[23:39] **Grayman**: Yep. So I don't know if there's really much more to say than that. I feel blessed that I never really got involved in that part of the so-called industry. I mean, to me, it literally is just a scam. It makes no sense. I mean, they do sell Bitcoin and they do sell Cardano, and that's great. But that's fine. If 99% of what they sell are tokens that they extract hundreds of thousands of dollars from the community and team and then get a bunch of tokens and then as soon as they get listed they dunk on them and they drop off I mean, it's like a vampire. I can't believe anybody participates in this but there you go. Like they say the path is littered with bodies.

[24:35] **Grayman**: So Ergo is walking a different path. We aren't even like, I mean, I think that at one point there was a negotiated position with Binance US and the Ergo Foundation, which at the time was maybe, let's just say more well endowed entity than it is now as time has passed. They voted it down, wisely so in retrospect. And we never really had that much money in the till as a community because I think the Ergo Foundation was founded after the chain got started and funded by less than 5%, more than 4%, but less than 5% of the coins as they were mined. And so initially that led to a lot of ERG but not worth a lot of dollars, and so there was never really an opportunity for Ergo to play in that space unless some whale decided that they just wanted to underwrite it. And surprise, surprise, none of them did, because they recognize that that whole game is rigged and that it doesn't make any sense to play it to just hand your money to somebody that's going to come and insist that you give them more to keep playing. It's worse than a casino.

[26:00] **Grayman**: So I don't know what else to say. I feel bad for everybody that got hurt by that. But at the same time, you know, some of those people just need to get washed out. They're not here for the right reasons. To the extent that we see some of that in the Ergo forums, I just sort of shrug and it's, it's, I mean, I'm sure there are some people that look at whatever I post as being painful to read through or, or a skip over.

[26:26] **qx**: Oh, it's just painful to listen to you talk, Grayman, even for me, you know, I'm just kidding. Love hearing you talk, sir.

[26:34] **Grayman**: I don't know. I don't know what to say. It's, it's hard to, it's hard to see. It's, it is people saw complaining about it.

[26:42] **qx**: I just I can't I can't really even understand their motivations. So they get sold this, you know, put your money in and you'll get 20% 30% 40% rich. I mean when you go to a central exchange and they're advertising to hold a stable coin and get like 10% returns or whatever that bullshit is. I mean in a normal person's head that would like, how is this sustainable? What's going on here? So they're roped in by these kind of things of absolutely ridiculous returns, and then this kind of stuff can't be sustainable. The liquidity providers, and when I say liquidity providers, I mean the fools in their money, dry out.

[27:29] **Grayman**: Yeah. I mean, to be fair, I also, when I first started trying to learn about all this stuff, I was also led to these exchanges and whatnot. All of the talk of here's where you go to get this and whatnot. And it just seemed like it was such a broad and crazy space that the only way to get involved was to just grab some close by piece and start doing stuff. But it was pretty quickly, pretty easy to figure out that this is crazy town, like this is worse than a casino, and I have no interest in doing that. I could just play the stock market.

[28:05] **Grayman**: I mean, I guess a lot of the way that I think about it might be privileged by being an American, especially an older American towards the end of my career, or last third, let's say. So I have a little bit of time and money and wisdom and I can see you know, what's obvious bullshit. I think a lot of the people that get trapped are people that were just out of college and you know, they're just trying to get out in the world and swim and somebody's got a good comment in chat.

[28:38] **qx**: That's related to this. Mobius says fuck profit, can't think like that. And I think that's the problem, right? I think people need to be able to understand that there are many profit opportunities in Ergo. Many. There's SigmaFi, there's arbitrage, there's SigmaUSD Bank. There's a lot of profit opportunities in Ergo. There's MuShop, you know, for physical goods for profiting off that. A lot of profits, okay? And that's a sustainable profit. That's a profit that actually can sustain itself. What we're talking about here is obvious scam profits where it's a pyramid scheme where the idea is you make a profit because somebody else is there to lose a lot, right? That's the difference that we're speaking about here. Profit is fine. Nobody should shame anybody about profit, right? And there's plenty of opportunities in Ergo to do so. There's a huge difference between that and what you're seeing at central casino exchanges. Huge difference, Mobius.

[29:31] **Grayman**: Yeah, but profit that's made from a hype machine is just at the expense of the losers. Yeah, exactly. And it's not going to be sustainable. So it doesn't make any sense. Yeah, you have to build slowly but surely tools that can be used and eventually the exponential turns the corner and starts being faster than you can even get ready for and eventually becomes an asset.

[29:55] **qx**: You can't build a foundation on balloons. One of them pops, you're done.

[29:58] **Grayman**: Yeah, so Ergo has been slow and steady. It's getting better and better. It's sort of the Kaizen mentality. Every we just got, you know, node six has just come out already starting to think about the repercussions of that and how to turn it into sub blocks and getting back into finance online. There's a lot of stuff that's cooking and it didn't start cooking yesterday, right? It's been going for a while, consistently working on building and making it better as a tool, not as a toy or as a fad. And that feels like what all of this pumped out fun shit is. It's just let's try and make a fad.

[30:43] **qx**: It's like Ergo is perpetual soup, Grayman. It's always been cooking for a long time and you come back a year later and it might taste different, but it's been cooking the entire time.

[30:54] **Grayman**: Right, yep.

[30:56] **qx**: Yeah, HQ's got a question in chat. A good question, actually. A good for HQ, that's for sure. Question, what would be the outcome when EF publishes similar announcements as Kadena, as they are running out of funds, etc. Should we be sharing on socials why EF actually isn't behind the core Devon, etc. ETC nowhere to go. I think we've been preaching that as often as we can, HQ. I think everybody out here on the AMAs has made it very clear that EF's overall goal was - kushti's gonna jump in with this. I said EF. EF's overall goal is to fade into some other part of existence. You know, their goal was to bootstrap in that sense. Sorry, go for it kushti.

[31:35] **kushti**: Yeah, so well as a guy who actually founded EF, I'm finding all those talks strange. So it seems well at some point well the EF got perceived as a kind of main entity, maybe establishing entity. But actually it was established a month after the main at launch. It was November or December 2019. And yeah, to that moment, well, Ergo was listed on like five or six exchanges, right? So, well, the development went well without EF and so on, right? So, well, I mean, things were made without the EF for starters, right? So for many months and yeah, well, then basically since 2022, I believe, so Joe and me and others, I believe also, well, pushing the idea that EF is well, by definition is not around for forever, probably right. I mean, no one knows, maybe it can find some ways to exist forever. But to the best of my knowledge, that there is no any human made organization, which lived forever. Right. Even to survive for like 20 years for a foundation or a commercial company is already quite exceptional. I know such corporations, companies, but we simply don't know. Thousands disappeared, right? So, well...

[33:49] **qx**: I think kushti, I think you should...

[33:50] **Grayman**: They've handed off a lot of their important duties already to the SIGs and to the Infradow, and there's still more that they retain, but those could be handed off as well. I mean, one that's really stand out for me is ErgoDocs is just spectacular and updated and it's very in depth and it's going to be sad to see that sort of official duty of the EF disappear along with everything else when that time comes. But presumably the community will pick it up and maintain it. We just need to get to that point. There's also the website, which I think is quite good as is, but apparently there's a new one coming at some point and that's great. But, you know, that's also something that in the future, I mean, what's Bitcoin.com? It's whoever owns that domain. We're going to have to move past the idea that that like, what's the website for Linux? I mean, it just, you know, there's something that just needs to go away.

[34:58] **qx**: Get some onion links for the Ergo hosted website. That'd be great.

[35:02] **kushti**: Makes a little too exclusive for the website. So another one is coming. Well, it's coming. Yeah. For many, many months, but they can't push because it's just volunteer some volunteer. Yeah, well not paid by any party and well, I've seen some drafts a few months ago and recently, I've got a message that it's basically ready. So wow, I can check it in days and and then, yeah, let's see when it will be launched. But it would be different from EFs. And I think it's also good, right? It's OK for diverse.

[35:59] **qx**: We could actually launch that directly on infra for now, if we want to, at least for the, you know, just launch straight to that. And then you can live side by side for a minute and we can make sure it works and go from there.

[36:11] **kushti**: That would be interesting. And yeah, so that's another website is more sci-fi punk-ish. And yeah, well, it's made to the guys' preferences. And yeah, no one can judge here.

[36:31] **hq3rr**: I do hold .erg. And if we guys want to release something .erg, so maybe we can do platform.erg and release that on there.

[36:42] **qx**: You bought the entire endpoint there the entire what's it called? How much was that?

[36:51] **hq3rr**: It was gifted from from handshakes. Yes.

[36:54] **qx**: Oh you bought the handshake. Yeah, I got you. Okay. I was gonna say cuz dot Ergs gotta be some country in Europe or something, right? Yeah. Let's see, .erg is, I don't know. I don't know. But I was back to community guys, when you're talking, I feel like, I feel like, a good community in, like Ergo is, should be, yeah, HQ3rr is going to start a country. A good community is, like the ship of Theseus. You guys familiar with that?

[37:33] **qx**: So that's a thought experiment that says if you have a ship, a wooden ship, right? You guys, we'll save for everybody online. If you have a wooden ship and over hundreds of years you replace every single board, you know, one at a time or every so often, and after many, many years the ship is totally different boards. There are no original boards in the ship or sails or anything. Is at the same ship, right? And I think a lot of people say, yeah, it's the same ship, right? So I feel like a good community is like the ship of Theseus, right? You have, you know, the community back in the day, it's still the Ergo community, the community in the future is still the Ergo community, but it's changed so much, might not even be same members, right? But the mission remains the same, the experiences, the experience, the historical knowledge base remains the same. All that kind of stuff moves with the community as it comes along. So I think that's an indicator of a good project that has something like this, not something that's just a captain that runs around on whatever ship has the biggest sail. And then if the ship sinks, he's like, fuck off, I've got my treasure chest, goodbye. And then it goes down for good. Whereas this kind of community is very resilient.

[38:52] **benzel**: I wanted to add to that prior question of how would that situation be perceived by the community? I think it would be celebrated even from the tone of the organization themselves releasing it, wouldn't be in the tone of how Kadena released it. The EF will be glad to say, hey, this has already been the plan. So to answer the question directly, I think it would be a good thing, a good sign for that announcement in our community versus how it was accepted in the other one.

[39:21] **qx**: I think you're right, Benzel. I think you're right, because we saw this already pre-played out with Joe leaving the EF, with kushti leaving the EF. It was like, oh, you know, this is expected. This is what's happening. It's like kids going off to college. It was a sad day, though. Yeah, it's sad, but it's like, oh, this is what's supposed to happen. This is evolution of what's supposed to happen. I love your sweatshirt. Did you get that at the meetup, sir?

[39:46] **benzel**: This is my physical airdrop. This is how I got the claims of free stuff right here.

[39:50] **qx**: This is my airdrop. All right. Did you get a hat?

[39:52] **benzel**: This is the only free airdrops we do is physical in person.

[39:55] **qx**: Did you bring a hat back with you from Colorado?

[39:57] **benzel**: Oh, I didn't. I think Chris got them all, so I might have to ask him to ship me one.

[40:01] **qx**: Chris took them all?

[40:02] **benzel**: No, no, no. He grabbed them because they were left there. I guess they could have been in that church for a bit.

[40:08] **hq3rr**: I think he posted on socials like, I don't know how, but I have got these. So maybe he was drunk and he took all of them. I got a shirt too.

[40:20] **qx**: Oh, the mining shirt. That's awesome. Fantastic. I'm wearing my sweatshirt that I stole from Joe at Vegas a couple of years ago.

[40:28] **benzel**: He was supposed to give me his Rosen Bridge sweatshirt, but it's the only one he has so I didn't want it. But he still have to steal it like you have to steal it. I can't take the only one you have I feel bad.

[40:38] **qx**: That's what he does. That's Joe's MO. He'll bring something leave it on a chair and expect somebody to take it. You know take as much control over Joe's merchandise as you can. I think it's the same. You know, I still haven't washed this in two years. It still smells like Joe.

[40:53] **Grayman**: It's perfect. You know this disc that's awesome.

[40:58] **Grayman**: Old-school cool.

[40:59] **qx**: What's that?

[41:01] **Grayman**: Old-school cool like steal this disc.

[41:04] **qx**: Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Yep. Those are the days, right?

[41:11] **qx**: No, overall I'd say my sentiment towards Ergo always remains the same, right? There's no external factors that make me think, oh, you know, I'm worried for the future of Ergo. It's all that, yep, this is like watching a play play out that we know the ending to. This is exactly what we expected to happen to this centralized entity, you know, and here we are just trucking along. Sorry, Grayman, go for it.

[41:36] **Grayman**: But that sounds like a godlike perspective. I'm just in the soup. I don't know how it's going to end, but it gets better and better for me. So I know we're going in the right direction. I mean, there could be a wave that goes and smashes the entire thing apart. But I doubt it, I think there will be a wave that'll smash almost the entire industry apart at some point, sooner or later. I mean, if nothing else, a decade from now when Bitcoin's halving takes it to the point where there's no security budget anymore, that's going to be a hell of a wave. And when that happens, it's going to be a question of who can survive that tragedy. And I think that we're aiming in the right direction.

[42:19] **Grayman**: I mean, if you say fuck Binance, sorry, bleep that out. But if you say that you don't want to deal with Binance or any of these other extractive exchanges, well, we have ways to deal with that. We have Rosen Bridge. We have very soon we have Machina Finance, which will make it so that we have long chain liquidity that's constantly running and that can be done with Rosen bridged assets. And so to be fair liquidity bootstrapping is always a problem and one of the biggest complaints about a smaller blockchain or community. But there's something where you can literally put your money where your mouth is and allocate a portion of your holdings to trading and liquidity according to a robot that you set up to do it. And you can rest assured that it's still going to be self custody within your wallet and that you have ultimate control over the whole thing without dealing with Binance, you know what now, right? It's there. The ball's gonna be in their court in the long run when that wave crashes and destroys a lot of stuff. Hopefully it destroys them too but we got to have a way for people to interact and I think we've got it and I think we lead the industry in that sense. There are other tools on other systems that are close to this, but not the same.

[44:02] **kushti**: I think Ergo is extremely well positioned for the rug season. For starters, is Binance now available in the US?

[44:07] **qx**: I don't know. I don't touch that.

[44:10] **benzel**: It's a Binance US domain that the government kind of made them give up ownership of that.

[44:17] **qx**: Yeah, it's different things though, right? It's quite a bit limited compared to the other Binance, if I recall correctly.

[44:26] **Grayman**: Separate, but probably run by the same crowd of crooks and so therefore not so separate.

[44:32] **benzel**: But the Binance Smart Chain is the bridge between the two, I believe.

[44:37] **kushti**: Well, anyway, probably it's worth to consider to withdraw from it, especially in the US, because I think at some point we may see maybe the second term or another crackdown. Well, because, yeah, it seems now, well, crypto Twitter are full of accusations, right, towards Binance, hard to say. Well, well, so some are definitely real, because, well, the exchange is scammy, as well as its owner, right, and people around. Well, but, yeah, well, as usually in such things, well, maybe it's kind of preparation, right, for some actions also. Hard to say at this point, we'll see. But yeah, it's better to stay away from all CSAT related. So it's actually much worse than Kadena and so on. All his assets, like DEX tokens and so on. They are not even pretending to be proof of work like Kadena and so on, just some tokens printed by the guy to his own pockets then yeah well partly distributed but yeah for BNB still more than 70 percent in his pockets so he is simply controlling the market and the...

[46:22] **kushti**: Well, another thing is, well, why I'm thinking about rug season. So many people in this crypto space did await for all season, right? Well, and they provided some probably valid arguments that markets are cyclical and so on. Right, and I think, yeah, those arguments are convincing, but only in the presence of markets, right, so more or less free markets. So in the case of, well, markets like we had in 2013, 2017, so mostly proof of work cryptocurrencies, well, mostly. Well, also proof of stake cryptocurrencies distributed through ICOs, right? So, well, quite well distributed after all, in comparison with today's nonsense, like oligarchs tokens. So, yeah, well, if markets would be similar, then, yeah, maybe we would care for all season. But with tokens, which are dominating in the market now, we simply don't care for markets, right? So, well, it's not markets when supply is basically controlled and can be changed for free at any moment. The owner of a token can just send a portion to an exchange and liquidate everyone. In this environment we don't have markets, so it's quite about manipulations, multi-level manipulations. Instead of alt season, we have rug season, so it's not cyclical markets behavior. It's not about markets after all this crypto space at this point. So we need for all these dots to be washed out somehow and that's what we are starting to see maybe.

[49:12] **qx**: Yeah, I think too, going off what you just said, kushti, I think people also flock to familiar, right? So that's exactly how the fiat world works, right? You know, it's always them against the top against retail, right? And cryptocurrency was supposed to, and is supposed to, and what Ergo is doing, is balancing that out, right? It's making it so that it becomes apparent who is the person that holds most of the things and can just manipulate as they like. So, you know Ergo follows that but a lot of other chains do not and just mimic what they see in the fiat world. So when people flock they are looking for somebody to be a leader. They're looking for some organization to own something so they can feel safe. When in reality there were never even safe in the fiat world when that happens, right? It's a classic example of the walrus and the oysters, right? You know, you're led to a table for dinner.

[50:10] **Grayman**: This would be a good time to plug Joe's talk on the Meetup.

[50:16] **qx**: Yes, great. Go for it, Grayman. You plug it.

[50:19] **Grayman**: I mean, you're basically just stating what a third of the talk was about, was that, you know, we just need to not look for leaders, but look for solutions. Yeah. And, you know, that's, it's worth watching. All the talks are worth watching. That Meetup was a spectacular event for me. I haven't worked my way through all of them, but I did rewatch Joe's and it stands up everything about it's perfect. It was off the cuff and spoke from the heart and it anticipated what we're witnessing happen right now. So, you know, I don't want to gloat and watch all these people suffer from the market falling apart. I hope nobody takes it that way. But yeah, I mean it seems inevitable to me. So on that level, I hope people get out before they get hurt and find a safe place to be and that could be Ergo. I hope it is but it could be whatever land precious metals, you know, whatever you can do to secure your your your future and your you know your your treasure is worth doing because sticking around in the crypto system where people can rug you at any moment is not a good place to be so?

[51:35] **qx**: Yeah, I would say don't look for leaders. Don't seek out leaders in this space. Seek out, lead yourself and seek out peers, right? You know, I mean, it's perfect if you want to, you know, like, it's amazing to be like, Joe's amazing, kushti's amazing, Grayman's amazing, it's great to hear them talk. And that's great. But, you know, like, we could have somebody that fucks up big time, right? Like, let's take Cardano and Charles Hoskinson. What if something is revealed that's absolutely awful? Right? There goes the chain. Done. Right? There's a whole leader of the chain it's looking at. Right? And whether that's due to the community looking to Charles to lead or Charles not letting go, you know, fully, I don't know. But that's dangerous. Right? So trust yourself. Lead yourself and seek out peers. It's 10 o'clock.

[52:25] **Grayman**: I got to go, boys.

[52:27] **Grayman**: Yeah, there we go. Hold on, everybody. We've got to roll out the outro. We all need you. Hi, everybody. Good morning.

[52:39] **qx**: All right, everybody. Let's say some talk for next week. Amazing for everybody to join us. We had Benzel, kushti, Grayman, hq3rr, and meta. Sorry, go for it kushti. What are you gonna say? Benzel?

[52:52] **kushti**: Yeah, so as always let's continue our the text chat. So Grayman I will jump on chain cache basis chat a bit later with silver sense and so on. Then yeah, let's continue to discuss. So if we can find something like a Kadena community, then yeah, let's try to organize space with them. But yeah, we still need to find community. So they have a group of 35,000 people, but I haven't found any community there. Tourist base? Yeah, so we can do Twitter space once they somehow self-organize to discuss what to do with development and so on, right? So we may offer them to switch to ASIC resistant proof of work and so on, right? So to do some crisis management and... So, but see also in regards with community organization, we can share a lot of experience, right, because we have a lot of experience got our the six years. But well, there are a lot of companies that own blockchains around and we need to educate the users before the blockchains get collapsed.

[54:30] **hq3rr**: I have a question. Why not set up example and just bring them, adopt them to the Rosen Bridge and bring the whole chain and use the wrapped assets on Ergo instead of giving them another solution to adopt to it, how to like us and that.

[54:45] **qx**: So what's the community there? It's a six community miners, right? What are they going to do on Ergo? Sell their ASIC for GPUs? What community is that? I guess, yeah, yeah, good. Where's Joe? Get that shit together, Joe.

[55:00] **hq3rr**: Yeah, because we have, we already have and we need a test. We need to test it with something. And if we have opportunity to show someone that they can do it here. So if it happened today with Kadena, tomorrow it will happen with another chain, which are run by VCs or they are run by companies. So they have a pathway to join and go and see how they can have a more decentralized and everything more controlled. how to do it and we will learn how to run the sidechains also.

[55:35] **kushti**: Yeah actually a good idea right so well if for some reason well usually for having big losses and well inability to fix them so someone is still a stick to a company owned blockchain right so we may offer well, just to try Ergo for starters as a plan B, right? Because, yeah, well, inevitably, any company like 99% will go bankrupt, right? And then, yeah, blockchains associated with them will be collapsed as well. So, I don't know, what's the statistic for commercial companies outside crypto? I think in 10 years, like 99% of companies.

[56:34] **qx**: It's big, yeah.

[56:36] **kushti**: Yeah, and I think in crypto it should be even more, right, because this space is crazy.

[56:45] **qx**: Well, plus, in crypto it's global, right? In crypto, it's global. So, you know, it's not like a small company in Arkansas that jumps up is going to have an effect on somebody in China, right? So, but in crypto, you could start up a chain and it's immediately 100% global right off the bat. So yeah, I agree, kushti. It's more than 99%.

[57:05] **Grayman**: It's also global on Amazon, maybe. Yeah, it's not just geographic distribution, though. It's also distribution of applications and industries that we can support. So we are a platform, not a company. It's a cathedral. It's a place where many different types can come to worship and participate in our little religion that we're growing here. It's a cathedral, and we need to think of it like that, something that's going to last for hundreds of years. Mistakes will be made, but they'll get ironed out before hundreds of years, something's for sure.

[57:45] **qx**: Plant a tree so your children can sit in the shade, right?

[57:49] **kushti**: Yeah, exactly. So I think, yeah, it should be promoted as kind of a cathedral or Unix, right? Because well, Unix at some point also adopted this cathedral methodology, right? So just to build in a composable way. So we are composing simple tools, right? Something impressive, our decades, maybe centuries to come.

[58:23] **qx**: Guys, that's a good place to end it. I really have to go. So great talking to everybody here today. kushti, do you want to end it?

[58:31] **kushti**: Thank you. Bye. So let's continue. Yeah.

[58:35] **qx**: Continuing checks to everybody. We'll see you next week. Same time. Thanks so much everybody. Bye bye.
