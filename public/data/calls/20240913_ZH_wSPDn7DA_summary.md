# Ergo Blockchain Community Call Summary
**Date:** September 13, 2024  
**Title:** Ergo PoW Blockchain - Weekly Update & AMA - September 12th 2024

## Executive Summary

This weekly Ergo community call provided comprehensive updates on multiple development fronts and emerging use cases. Key highlights included the successful implementation of storage rent collection in the Sigmanauts mining pool - making it the first pool to offer this feature - and significant progress on Sigma 6.0 development with new cryptographic capabilities. The team also discussed the near-completion of Rosen Bridge's Ethereum integration, with recent screenshots showing Metamask integration, and announced an upcoming community spaces session focused on marketing and memetics strategies.

The conversation emphasized Ergo's positioning as "after central banks tooling" - infrastructure that provides financial alternatives both during current times when central banking doesn't serve all communities effectively, and as a Plan B for potential future scenarios. Real-world applications are expanding, including a new DAO implementation for Cornell students and ongoing ChainCash development, demonstrating Ergo's practical utility beyond speculative use cases.

## Key Discussion Points

• **Storage Rent Collection Implementation**: Sigmanauts mining pool successfully deployed the first storage rent collection system, with two types - Type 1 (anyone can collect from underfunded boxes) and Type 2 (miners recreate change boxes for adequately funded UTXOs)

• **Sigma 6.0 Development Progress**: Continued development with new unsigned big integer data types for cryptographic applications, upcoming DevNet testing, and enhanced support for Sigma protocols and bulletproofs

• **Rosen Bridge Near Completion**: Ethereum integration showing Metamask compatibility, with 30,000 additional ERG recently bridged to Cardano, indicating growing demand for Ergo as collateral

• **Sub-blocks Implementation**: Peer-to-peer messaging completed, with DevNet testing planned before potential public testnet deployment

• **Real-World Applications**: Cornell University DAO implementation using Cornell USD tokens for budget allocation, ChainCash redemption features completed, and Cup of Sugar project development

• **Community Bubble Discussion**: Addressing concerns about ecosystem isolation and strategies for reaching beyond crypto users to onboard mainstream adoption

• **ChainCash Flexibility**: System allows both fully collateralized and under-collateralized notes, enabling trust-based transactions within chosen communities while maintaining blockchain guarantees where desired

## Decisions Made

• **Mining Pool Transition**: Sigmanauts mining pool members directed to migrate to Mark the Shark's new server infrastructure for improved storage rent collection

• **Moderation Policy Vote**: Sigmanauts community voting on moderation policies for healthier, more productive conversations across all Sigmanauts-owned channels

• **Community Spaces Session**: Scheduled memetics and marketing discussion session for 2 hours after the call to address community engagement strategies

• **Documentation Focus**: Plan to document Sigma 6.0 cryptographic capabilities and organize workshops on contractual money experiments

## Notable Quotes

**kushti**: "Ergo is actually this - so it's after central banks tooling, which is useful even when central banks are around because they are not - I think, well, right, a lot of places. Yeah, well, a lot of communities actually not quite covered by what they're doing."

**qx()**: "It's amazing to not even have to think about, like, holy shit, is minting 10,000 NFTs going to cost me $1,000? Is, you know, sending all these airdrops to the students going to cost me 50 bucks? You know, it's like, on Ergo, no, those are not worries you ever have to think about."

**kushti**: "But yeah, but also the quality of money itself here. So the quality of Ethereum is degrading, right? Because it's not backed by proof of work anymore... Bitcoin is not programmable and bridges are not good... Ergo with Rosen can provide good collateral."
