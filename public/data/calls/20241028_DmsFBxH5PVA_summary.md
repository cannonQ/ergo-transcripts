# Ergo Blockchain Community Call Summary
**Date:** October 28, 2024  
**Title:** Dev Update Oct. 28th 2024 | Cyberverse, Paideia, MewFinance, Sigs Mining, Sigmaspace and more!

## Executive Summary

This community call focused heavily on the Sigmanauts Mining Pool DAO, which has grown to 76+ gigahash since launching six months ago. The pool represents a unique approach to Proof-of-Work mining by implementing storage rent collection, bonus token distributions, and democratic governance through Paideia voting. Host qx() emphasized the pool's educational mission to engage miners in Ergo's ecosystem beyond simple profit mining.

The call highlighted significant ecosystem progress across multiple projects. Cyberverse released a new multiplayer mini-game called "Rocket Rush," Paideia is preparing to launch from beta to mainnet, and MewFinance continues expanding its decentralized marketplace integration with hardware wallets. Additionally, the Rosen Bridge team announced testing for RoseNet, a new peer-to-peer communication layer that will improve bridge security and scalability.

## Key Discussion Points

• **Sigmanauts Mining Pool DAO** - First mining pool implementing storage rent collection, democratic governance, and educational initiatives for miners
• **Cross-chain mining rewards** - Development of NFT-based system allowing miners to receive payments in any Rosen token while securing Ergo
• **Cyberverse gaming expansion** - New "Rocket Rush" multiplayer mini-game with detailed mechanics and power-ups
• **Paideia DAO platform** - Moving from beta to mainnet with treasury management and configuration updates
• **Hardware wallet integration** - Keystone wallet development and MewStore integration progress  
• **RoseNet testing** - Community participation needed for global decentralized testing of new Rosen Bridge P2P layer
• **Ecosystem utilization** - Emphasis on actively using dApps, providing liquidity, and engaging with the ecosystem rather than passive holding

## Decisions Made

• Sigmanauts DAO voted on storage rent distribution method (specific outcome to be confirmed in Paideia)
• Paideia will create a free DAO for Sigmanauts community during mainnet transition
• Mining pool bonus payments will be distributed evenly among participants for one month based on recent vote
• RoseNet testing requires community volunteers with stable internet and modern hardware (8GB RAM, 8+ CPU cores)

## Notable Quotes

**qx():** "The best and easiest way without borders that you guys can get ERG is to convert your electricity into ERG. It's as simple as that. There's no easier way to get ERG than doing that."

**qx():** "The really, really cool part of that is that you can mine proof of stake chains, like Ethereum, like Cardano, but also contribute to the security of the Ergo blockchain, which I think is really damn cool."

**qx():** "Nothing happens good if we're just sitting on stuff and not utilizing it... It's all about utilizing it and interacting with it. And the more that happens and the more we make a stable foundation of us doing that, the more resilient Ergo is going to get."
