# Ergo Blockchain Community Call Summary
**August 12, 2024 - Dev Update**

## Executive Summary

This community call featured kushti, Ergo's founder, joining qx() for a comprehensive development update after a several-week hiatus. The discussion covered significant progress across multiple Ergo ecosystem projects, with particular emphasis on upcoming releases and the philosophical direction of the blockchain space. kushti highlighted that Ergo now has sufficient foundational technology to make real-world impact, shifting focus from theoretical research to practical implementation.

The call covered major updates to Rosen Bridge's EVM integration, the upcoming Node 5.1 release with RocksDB support, progress on Sigma 6.0, and kushti's work on ChainCash and Dexy. The conversation also touched on broader industry concerns about VCs redefining cryptographic terms and the casino-like nature of many blockchain projects, contrasting this with Ergo's focus on building genuine financial infrastructure for underbanked populations.

## Key Discussion Points

• **Rosen Bridge**: Multiple guard updates pushed for EVM integration, improved communication protocols with guards, and progress on decimal handling for EVM chains

• **Node Development**: Version 5.0.23 ready for testing, Node 5.1 with RocksDB nearing release (requiring full resync), both versions will be supported simultaneously

• **Sigma 6.0**: Final implementation stage with multiple pull requests under review and testing

• **ChainCash**: Blockchain scanning completed by Dusek, API development in progress, looking for contributors for what could become commercially viable

• **Dexy**: LP redemption contract deployed to mainnet, remaining contracts to be deployed soon for soft launch

• **Community Outreach**: Plans for RareEvo conference attendance with promotional materials and wallet distribution

• **Mining Pool**: Sigmanauts pool transitioning to new infrastructure to reduce costs from $100/month to $20/month

## Decisions Made

• Node 5.0 will remain the default Docker release for several months to maintain compatibility
• Both Node 5.0 and 5.1 versions will be supported simultaneously during transition period  
• ChainCash will focus on API completion and simple client development to attract contributors
• Dexy contracts ready for mainnet deployment following successful testing
• RareEvo conference attendance confirmed with multiple community representatives

## Notable Quotes

**kushti on Ergo's current focus**: "For now, there is enough material, I guess, to make a real world impact. I mean, all the elements are known. The only thing is to put them in place, right, so a lot of work, but it's pretty straightforward."

**kushti on industry concerns**: "I saw some VCs actually lecturing researchers working in cryptography that the terms should be redefined because that's convenient, right to VCs... I haven't seen anything like that in any other space, to be honest. When some guys with big money is coming and starting to lecture basically scientists."

**kushti on developer interest**: "In recent months, I've seen quite a lot of interest rights to ergo actually having talks with developers and yeah they're pretty keen and well unlike general public so they're not fond of entertainment casino-like systems, right? So, yeah, they are looking for something different."
