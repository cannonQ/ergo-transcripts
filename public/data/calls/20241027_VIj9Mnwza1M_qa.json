      "asker": "Implied from survey feedback",
      "answer": "Mixer integration would probably change the wallet game in crypto because while there might be wallets with some mixer integration, Ergo's mixer is open source. This makes it even more beneficial on an Ergo wallet because you'd have an open source wallet with an open source mixer.",

Multisig could be a cool feature that gives users more options and could entice people to make more projects with funds held in multisig.",
