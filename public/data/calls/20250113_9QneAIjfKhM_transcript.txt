[00:05] **Armeanio**: Welcome, everybody. We wanted to put together a 2025 video. We've done that in previous years, so I thought it'd be good to spend some time with Alex and catch up with Ergo, how things are going and where we're going, I guess, most importantly. So how are you doing today, Alex?

[00:23] **kushti**: Hello everyone, yeah, doing well. So it's weekend but busy with Ergo development, so just published sub-blocks, so inputs and ordering blocks. EAP draft initial one, but yeah, we'll improve it in the coming days. And yeah, we're also working on prototyping codes. There is some already done, but more will be done. And yeah, well, a lot of other things going on at the same time. So with 6.0 development, 6.0 audits, and so on. So yeah, well, it's a busy, busy time.

[01:10] **Armeanio**: So why don't we start with the sub-blocks, since that's kind of in your mind already. Where do you see kind of the use of sub-blocks. Those of you that don't know, it's been inspired by Prism and as well as Parallel Proof of Work, which I believe Agolos came out with that paper. So what do you see that doing to the network and how do you see that changing not only transactions and user experience, but mining in general?

[01:41] **kushti**: Yeah, also bottlenecks. So currently, well, it's, you know, well, on average, every two minutes on average. Yeah, a new block is being generated, propagated over the network, right, and well, the network has a big load, right, every two minutes, but other than that, well, the load is minimal, right, so the network is idle. The sub-blocks, well, the loads will become spread, right? So, well, the network would be busy all the time and yes, well, the bottleneck is moving to network bandwidth, right? And well, this resource network bandwidth is hopefully will become more and more available with time, right? So even with well flat peer-to-peer network, we will get better performance every year basically.

[03:05] **Armeanio**: Awesome. So how do you see that differing from how many other cryptocurrencies are attempting to kind of scale their bandwidth?

[03:16] **kushti**: Yeah, but most are not even trying, right? So, well, the general approach unfortunately seen now is just to make networks less peer-to-peer, more centralized, right? So, well, to rely on just, well, powerful validators in data centers, so powerful machines with a lot of well, memory and bandwidth. But then, yeah, well, it's also about, well, increasing centralization, right, in regards to many aspects like validation. So most of our network clients just have to trust those powerful validators.

And yeah, well, it's also about centralization of power, decision-making in the community to some degree, and also centralization of assets ownership, because usually those validators also have big stake, right? And they are going to have a bigger stake. That's why they are willing to block, right? So, well, it's kind of a digital oligarchy, right? After all.

[04:48] **Armeanio**: Yeah, there's a lot of systems where you have stake dominance and then you have order flow dominance. And then, you know, you kind of just have these kings in the system, right?

[05:00] **kushti**: Right, but also they're becoming more and more powerful, right? And, well, with that validation, centralization, there are also ones which don't know what's going on in the network even, right? Yeah, the massive gap, it seems.

Yeah, but then also, well, a lot of blockchains just doing something, just one specific step, right? And not always correct. So many are switching to proof of stake with claim that it is improving network performance, which is not the case already quite seen from my Ethereum experience, for example, right? Many are introducing very weird concepts such as sharding, so fragmenting liquidity in DeFi. This also having quite weird and inconvenient consequences in the real world.

So even sharding author Vitalik is now not talking about this anymore. And so on and so on. Many just changing constants that was popular in Bitcoin forks. just well-increasing block size, for example, and claiming that this is somehow related to scaling, right, and so on.

So, well, in Ergo, well, it was multi-level approach since day one, right, so it was the first network implementing stateless clients, as well as so-called lock-space mining. Right, and now bandwidth utilization, right. And well, doing all this preserving peer-to-peer nature of the network. which is always sometimes tricky, but yeah, well, it's the goal after to have a real peer-to-peer network.

[07:27] **Armeanio**: Yeah, it's foundational. I think that ultimately without that foundation everything else you build, you know, just as a different animal. And it's interesting to see how, I don't know, it's like everything is being abstracted further and further and further away from the notion of a peer-to-peer network, right?

[07:50] **kushti**: Right, and also, yeah, peer-to-peer exchange after all, right? So, well, with peer-to-peer network, naturally, you have also peer-to-peer exchange, right? So, well, even if we are doing some smart contract, right, it's just between you and me, right? It should be. We shouldn't have some contracts backed by VCs with, I don't know, admin keys belong to developers and VCs and, I don't know, them deciding to follow some regulations, I don't know. Which probably, well, you don't care about, right? Because, well, it's not even about your jurisdiction, maybe, right? But still it's enforced.

Yeah, and also there could be, I don't know, different adversarial actions, right, from those owners and also hackers and so on and the question is why do we need to accept all these rights when it's about peer-to-peer interaction.

[09:20] **Armeanio**: I think that's mostly lost, sadly, in the crypto space, right? Where, you know, it's no longer about like my ability to I don't know, interact directly with you with no intermediary or no point of control in the middle. Right. And things have been, I don't know, shifting for a long time in the crypto industry space to where now it's quote unquote web three, whatever that means. versus peer-to-peer.

[09:53] **kushti**: Yeah, and so yeah, this web3 usually means nothing, right? So there was a foundational article by Gavin Wood but yeah well initially the term was used for actually very different things right so initially it was introduced by Tim Berners-Lee and Web3 by Tim Berners-Lee was about making a web machine-friendly, right, by using semantic web tools and so on.

But then, yeah, well... Gavin Wood maybe because of not being very literate about, I don't know, works of other people, foundational works, by the way, and well, already quite established. So well, I visited Web3 conferences back in 2008, 2009, right? So before all those blockchains and yeah, I mean, people discussed all that stuff by Tim Berners-Lee.

But okay, so yeah, we heard maybe not very literate guy from Ethereum will reintroduce the term, but what we have now is not corresponding even to that, right? And currently Web3 is mostly just some web term used to introduce tokens mostly, right? And yeah, the token game with VCs, right? Backing your tokenomics, let's say. So yeah, well, aside of that, well, most of Web3 projects don't make any sense, to be honest.

[11:56] **Armeanio**: No, I think 2025 is definitely going to be an interesting year to watch like general mission drift in the cryptocurrency space where it started with this idea of peer to peer networks and censorship resistant exchange between anyone anywhere in the world to, yeah, more. I don't know. I think as you see regulation and friendlier potential, there's going to be a lot of honeypotting where people try to position for control in essence, right?

Like the magic of Bitcoin initially was like if under these certain set of assumptions, you can assume that the network is honest and operating trustlessly, right? And things have kind of been re-engineered to where there's all these different layers or wrappers of trust, you know, up and down different stacks to where it's hard to call certain things like DeFi when, you know, at the end of the day, you're talking about things with potentially a lot of legal entanglement and backing by government bonds and, you know, all kinds of strange beasts coming into the space.

So I don't know. I think that long term, that's going to be an interesting differentiator is the idea of like compliance and the potential reward trade off on that side versus trying to remain open and neutral and censorship resistant. You know, in a world where I think that schism is going to just increase from where we are today. Interesting. Yeah.

[13:44] **kushti**: Yeah. So, well, going back to sub-blocks. So, oh, yeah, well, that would bring network performance to theoretical maximum, right? It's possible for peer-to-peer network. But then, yeah, well, always possible to make optimizations, right? For, well, message exchange and peer-to-peer networks. And also networking is making progress from year to year and well with that there will be a natural performance increase and well in Ergo well it's.

It was chosen to have flexible approach, right? So to avoid any magic constants here like block size and so on. So to give miners possibility to readjust parameters because well, we have progress in the hardware, right? And not just hardware with time.

[14:53] **Armeanio**: Yeah, yeah, I do hope that, you know, we see a lot more miner involvement. Seeing the Sigmanauts pool starting to implement demurrage is pretty awesome. I saw that they had thrown up a mining and ecosystem development grant from the EF, which I know that you and I are no longer directly a part of, but I certainly I hope that those that are looking at the EF take a long look and see kind of the value of mining because that's, you know, proof of work is, I don't know, becoming less common, I guess, in terms of how people are thinking.

But I don't know, maybe that has to do with like just education, right? So having some initiative to demonstrate the value of mining and decentralization and, you know, kind of what Ergo is working towards with GPU mining, I think would be really valuable. especially given, I don't know, crypto is a crazy space, my friend. I read things all the time where I just kind of scratch my head.

[16:02] **kushti**: Yeah, I actually think proof-of-work assets are getting appreciation and the more proof-of-stake assets we have, the more valuable perspective proof-of-work assets may become. Because well, proof-of-stake is giving holders free money basically, right? We are staking. And well, with those free money, people are often buying hard money, right? So proof of work currencies. So I think this is one of the reasons why Ethereum is doing poorly after the merge, right?

So well, now, well, Ethereum stakeholders are getting free money via staking, right? And well, what I'm thinking about, probably they are buying Bitcoin mostly, right, with those staking. And that's also probably happening with Ergo and Cardano maybe, right? And well, I think with time, so with more and more proof of stake assets, right? Means more and more free money have been distributed.

So well, money you can get for nothing just for having proof of stake assets, right? And well, holding them. Basically, so people would put those assets, proof-of-stake free assets into proof-of-work, right? This would make proof-of-work assets more valuable with time. I don't see well recognition of this pattern, but yeah, I think it's emerging actually.

[18:15] **Armeanio**: It could be. It could be. I think, like, with Ethereum, there was a period of time where they had this, you know, distributed proof of work security wall that was pretty amazing. And in my opinion, they actually had the right incentives in terms of MEV distribution, where because, you know, MEV itself was kind of being democratized through mining pools and adding to mining rewards, it created the right incentive for mining growth, right?

Meaning it's like that value is being distributed to support the security budget. And it's shifted a lot in a lot of proof of stake systems to where that value is, it goes to internal entities, it goes to, you know, like, you know, entrenched parties, which doesn't create an economic incentive, you know, for people to join versus having fee distribution. So I think that's a powerful vertical that, you know, hopefully, you know, I know, qx() has been looking at MEV and various potential cases for Lithos, which I guess we'll get to later.

But I really believe that, you know, demurrage and MEV distribution, it's creating the right incentives for a growing act set of security actors, I guess.

[19:41] **kushti**: Yeah, but also with proof of work, well, new Ethereum tokens were not for free, right? So, well, miners actually put a lot of work into the mining distributed supercomputer to get them, right? via work lottery. But now, yeah, well, new, well, Ethereum tokens are basically for free, right? So you just need to hold assets, right? And well, then, yeah, well, you, you can basically, well, exchange them to Bitcoin, right, depending on pricing, because you don't value, right, those free assets. Because the intrinsic value for those tokens is well about zero. Just a little bit of computational efforts to validate and propagate blocks around the network.

[21:06] **Armeanio**: So speaking of kind of financial products, you know, sometimes I get a lot of questions, you know, why Ergo is focusing on introducing, you know, different stable coins, stable coins design, different backings or pegs to algorithmic stable coins. So, you know, what in your mind kind of drew you to explore the Dexy implementation? versus, I guess, their traditional mindset is just going to be, let's, you know, deal with these freezancies, assets, you know, USDC, whatever, you know, fill in the letter. What made you more attracted to something like Dexy versus, I guess, the traditional stablecoin?

[21:58] **kushti**: Oh, but traditional are trusted, right? So, well, you trust Tether team. I don't know. I mean, I don't know who's there and why should they be trusted and probably they shouldn't, right? And even more, I don't know, probably no one really has trust, right? Tether folks, but still people are using tether, which is quite absurd.

So yeah, well, then there are different options, right? So you may have I don't know, like peer-to-peer trusted currencies. So well, maybe you can try to recreate a web of trust, right? So like traditional solutions from public key infrastructure, traditional decentralized approaches.

But yeah, I mean, you still need for some buffer at least, right, for some least common denominator, which is about algorithmic stablecoins, I believe. Right, so even if you, for example, issuing your own dollars, I don't know, or gold-backed tokens like Harmony or gold, for example, right, and I'm accepting them, but then I'm trying to pay with them, right? So, well, who will trust, right? And why people should trust?

But if, well, your tokens are backed at least partially, right? Or maybe fully with algorithmic stablecoin at the moment. I mean, if there is backing at the moment, right? Then, yeah, it's more or less trustless, right? So trust issues are solved here. If there is, well, unconditional redemption possible, right? Well, redemption without your control at least. So then, yeah, well, even if there is, you know, these trusted issuance, like if you're issuing your Armeanio tokens, then yeah, it's better to back them with algorithmic stable coins, right?

And maybe then work on eliminating or reducing need for algorithmic stablecoin liquidity with clearing, and so on. Or maybe have fractional reserve, maybe like free banking system, so eventually they went into fractional reserve state anyway. But yeah, well, for starters, you need for backing, right? To get trust and so on. And well, it would be much better than, well, having a trust to Tether team and well, government bonds they could have, but I mean, that's also a question of trust, right?

Whether such an issue to have, right? So they're trying to do audits and so on, but yes, still, you know, it's always a question of trust to some degree, at least. What do you think? But then, yeah, you also have trust in government bonds, right? Transitional trust and yeah, there are a lot of new issues arising.

[26:28] **Armeanio**: No, I think it breaks down to this idea that as kind of, I don't know, you started with Bitcoin, it was more or less a kind of simple straightforward system. And as things have become more complicated, you know, you get new layers, new layers of trust to where I think that in many cases that's not a concern anymore for people. Ultimately, what leads the general person to reevaluate trust is when it's misused or abused against them, right? And, you know, that's never an optimal way to learn but I guess in a way that is going to kind of be the path where let's see what the friction points are.

I don't know. It's gonna be an interesting year. There's I think there's gonna be a lot of like entanglements as some systems push for broader adoption and whatever compliance or schism away from this idea of open and censorship resistant trustless networks is going to be. That's going to be the most fascinating, let's say, vertical to watch in probably the next couple of years in the crypto space, I believe.

But I agree. I think that having algorithmic stablecoins or some notion of an asset that addresses volatility. You know, because again, if somebody is going to use cryptocurrencies as a form of payment, you know, when you get in line at the store, you want the same purchasing power when you, you know, finish checking out as when you got in line and sometimes like the volatile nature of these assets doesn't really do many favors in terms of kind of creating the adoption for kind of stable goods and services and exchange, et cetera. So I really do believe that stable coins in some sense have been and will be kind of like the first killer use case for programmable money where, you know, people are experiencing inflation or simply want to be more free from control systems and you know it's a nice option to have.

[29:03] **kushti**: Right and yeah so well algorithmic stable coins do have own cons right but still you know well it's useful building block for well more complex systems. So yeah, I mean, even for, as I explained, trusted, right? Stable coins like Armeanio gold in my example. So, well, it makes sense to have some trustless backing, right? So yeah, algorithmic stable coins essentially.

[29:54] **Armeanio**: So another big vertical I think that's quite interesting for the Ergo ecosystem is cross-chaining, merge mining, just interoperability in general. So with 6.0, what are we opening the door to support in terms of cross-chain interoperability on Ergo or side chains, double-merge mined side chains, all of that kind of space that we're growing into?

[30:28] **kushti**: Right, so it would be possible to have, well, Bitcoin relays, right? Well, already there is a prototype and then, well, two-way relays with Autolykos or maybe SHA-256 or whatever. Sigma side chains, right? So you may have a relay on Ergo chain and a relay on side chain. So sidechain relay on Ergo mainchain and mainchain relay on Sigma sidechain. And with that, you may have even trustless bridge, right, and other cross-chain trustless applications.

But yeah, there are more options, right? Like we have Rosen Bridge, right? To connect with, well, chains which are not so easy to connect in a trustless way, fully trustless, such as Bitcoin, well, Ethereum and so on, right? Most of popular chains.

[31:53] **Armeanio**: Yeah, I'm hoping that with Rosen, we continue to expand across the various ecosystems and points out there. And I think 2025 is going to be interesting in terms of plugging in market making bots on top. Right. I really do believe that a bridge has a just base transfer protocol is well, interesting. It allows you to create markets and open the door to arbitrage across different environments based on demand. But having the ability to manage liquidity more seamlessly and accelerate that, I really think is one of the keys to growth long term you know as well as potential solutions to kind of intermix faster bridging and DeFi which you know again accelerates kind of the arbitrage potential but you know even right

Even beyond, I think, having kind of relays and greater interoperability between ecosystems is certainly something I'm always going to encourage us to support and grow into. I think there's a lot of opportunity in that space that is still mostly unrealized.

[33:18] **kushti**: Yeah, so I think applications are needed, right? Well, in addition to bridges such as, well, onramp, right? And DEX access and so on. So, well, it would be good maybe for a Bitcoiner, right? Somewhere to use escrow contracts for, well, better onramp, right? So to get from fiat to Bitcoin. And then, yeah, maybe even to use Spectrum DEX to exchange a bit of Bitcoin immediately to gold, for example, to have exposure to both Bitcoin and gold. Spending fiat on that and using Ergo blockchain, right?

[34:29] **Armeanio**: Yeah, I think it's going to be an interesting year for metal stable coins. You know, if I put on my tinfoil hat and say, OK, well, like if I could change the trajectory of the crypto industry in one way for me, I think that like I don't know, we have these peer-to-peer networks that are kind of, they're a wrapper of the internet, right? And the internet itself is its own kind of animal that's decentralized. You have, you know, endpoints all over the world. And I don't know, I think that using fiat as like the primary peg or wrapper for cryptocurrency is just the wrong choice because it's centralized.

If the internet itself was centralized and we tried to build cryptocurrencies on top of a centralized network, it would be doomed to fail. And I think everyone can say like, yeah, that's a terrible idea. We need like a decentralized foundation to build off if we want resilience. And the same thing is true in terms of like the base monetary network that we build off. We chose the wrong one as an industry, in my opinion. Like, you know, gold and silver is every country you can pretty much find some fungibility dealer you know it's pretty universally accepted there's friction there but it is a decentralized base monetary network versus fiat is its own walled garden and so whenever you're going to deal with like these walled environments there's going to be a lot of entanglements it's going to

inevitably, like control is going to creep up from that foundation. So I think that at least having, you know, algorithmic, you know, gold and silver pegged assets, hopefully open the doors to where we can start building that foundation where metal becomes a I don't know, potential rail in certain areas. And in a way that's backwards, right? It should, probably should have been built the other way, but it wasn't. And I think a lot of the conflicts we're gonna run into as an industry is because we built off the wrong network. Like we didn't, again, go back to the internet. If we use some central system, how could we expect to be resilient through time?

[37:21] **kushti**: Yeah, so I agree. So yeah, gold, silver, maybe lithium even, right? So those assets actually do have very impressive decentralized mining networks, right? Much more decentralized than Ergo or Bitcoin, to be honest, right? So well, you can mine gold with variety of tools right starting with pretty medieval ones still used in many areas around the globe to very sophisticated chemistry based right more modern chemistry based tech well and

There are players of very different scale, right, from individuals and families in Africa, for example, to huge corporations, right, big nationwide corporations. So yeah, well, players of very different scale with very different tooling. And yeah, to be honest, unlike proof of work mining, so yeah, tooling is more decentralized. Yeah, right. So well, let's be clear because there is no

Well, economy of scale we do have in hardware and well, yeah, many attempts to... have more decentralized production of hardware actually failed, right? Because, well, it's a hard field for competition. It's very, very hard to compete with hardware manufacturers, existing ones, right? If you are starting to produce tools for mining, digital mining. But yes, digital mining is better than other ways to produce digital assets.

[39:55] **Armeanio**: I think GPU mining is in a very interesting place, to be honest. You know, in some sense, it's like Bitcoin has created this market where, I don't know, it's mostly about energy arbitrage, right? Like, miners are naturally, like, going to go to where there's excess energy and then try to, you know, plug in and profit from excess capacity, right?

And it seems as though, at least on the GPU side, we're seeing massive scaling of infrastructure around AI and, you know, LLMs. And it's going to be interesting to see if long term there's excess compute that then becomes like this driver for where it's, you know, most profitable to mine. It does kind of make sense. If you look at like proof of work is this mechanism of seeking over capacity, right? And that's always where it's more profitable is when you have over capacity, cheaper energy, cheaper, you know, hardware, et cetera. So I think GPU mining is an interesting place to be long-term actually.

[41:13] **kushti**: Right. But yeah, going back to physical assets, so yeah, well, they have very well established mining networks, right? And well, pretty understandable distribution, right? Made over centuries, if you're talking about gold and silver, especially. And so, yeah, well, also, well, you cannot create gold or silver out of thin air, right, unlike fiat currencies. So, well, it's, yeah, I mean, it should be naturally the basis, right, for stable coins or peer-to-peer networks.

[41:59] **Armeanio**: Well, originally, you know, metal was the peg for fiat, you know.

[42:04] **kushti**: Right, yeah.

[42:06] **Armeanio**: Like fiat was just a wrapper for, you know, metal itself. So I guess in some sense, having metal is like the base and some digital wrapper of metal. This is an interesting concept. Speaking of mining, are you tracking the Lithos development at all in terms of how that could potentially shift the centralized or decentralized nature of proof of work mining?

[42:39] **kushti**: So, yeah, trying to get details, but yeah, fairly general picture still, to be honest. Well, trying to get details from qx(), but yeah, well, it seems that there will be a lot of interesting things there, right? Even some, well, specific applications, specific rollups. which is quite interesting. And well, yeah, it's quite ambitious, right? And yeah, well, quite exciting, well, approach to reworking mining. What do you think about Lithos? Maybe you have more talks with qx().

[43:25] **Armeanio**: Well, I think that ultimately if we can get block production back towards the individual miner away from pools, you know, the network resilience of proof of work and kind of like this ability to, I don't know, censor validators is going to make it a lot more resilient, right? You know, we saw that in Bitcoin already. You know, that's kind of been an ongoing struggle with Ethereum as soon as they went to proof of stake, where it's like, you no longer have a fair network, in my opinion, like, okay, in Bitcoin,

Because Bitcoin is a bit dumb by nature it's more of like you get your payment later right now and that's not so terrible I guess depending on market conditions maybe at that at the wrong time some you know if you have block producers that are saying hey you're not gonna be in our block and you get kicked down the chain enough you know you could definitely encounter some like severe price impacts or something but it'll get there eventually right when you talk about like a network like Ethereum where race conditions are a lot more complicated because you have other assets.

Then things get really sketchy, right? Like you have DeFi and you have collateral that you're trying to like cover based on market conditions or you have an opportunity that's based on race conditions. You simply broke the network. You have you can't have like multi-tier user base where you know one person can come into a block half the time and economically compete with somebody that can always be included in a block like that's that's a breaking assumption and in my opinion for any like, yeah, neutral economy.

So I think if we like, ultimately, the way around that has to be like become uncensorable. And it makes sense in my framework that the only way to do that is to empower the individual miners. So there's not some like pool that, you know, inherits that liability. Does that make sense? Right, right. Which I guess gets you back to non-outsourceable puzzles. Why was that valuable when Ergo first launched? Kind of the same concept, right? Right. So I do think that long term that's still probably going like from an outside attack perspective. I think going after how blocks are built and like the choke points around fiat rails are the two primary like regulatory vectors. So hopefully, you know, we can be a bit hardened.

[46:29] **kushti**: Yeah, so I think, yeah, well, talking about non-outsourceable puzzles and Lithos. So I think for, well, every proof of work currency, it should be in desiderata rights to, well, have protection against pooling, right? But then, yeah, yeah, you have a lot of real world rights.

[46:58] **Armeanio**: Forces yeah you have you have incentives and I think that if you could create the right incentives to encourage local block production, then it's feasible. Because that's ultimately why people pool their hashrate anyway, is more predictable revenue flows or mining flows. There's an incentive to do so, and it's hard to say, okay, we're going to operate on principle and not incentives. That's a failed... that's gonna be a failed system real quick. Altruism is a terrible security assumption in the wild, I guess.

So yeah, I think we're in for an interesting time. Why don't we get into ChainCash? I know that's kind of been something that's been of in and out of your mind for years, you know, building free banking or alternative economies on top of Ergo.

[48:04] **kushti**: Oh, actually, yeah, I mean, initial thoughts appeared before the mainnet launch even, so back in 2018 probably. Right, something like that, but yeah, so the original idea was, so it had a different name even. Yeah, and the idea was to have a circle of circles, basically to have different local exchange trading systems, right, because that was primitive, known to me back then.

So I started with that so that the idea was to have well collateralized local exchange trading systems and non-collateralized and then to have some exchange right between different circles between different LETS systems and having gateways some economy, right, well for actors willing to project liquidity from one kind of financial system to another, right, and so on.

But yeah, then, yeah, so somehow I realized that, well, ChainCash so well spender signed currency based system could be actually a more general right so with that you may include local exchange trading systems as well as I don't know very different systems right you know in a single financial system global one and having basically the same right and well anyway you would have conditional acceptance right like in LETS of LETS circle of circles right but yeah also more flexibility and so on so that was quite evolutionary process

But yeah, so I think, well, it's the natural next step talking about ChainCash. So well, you have blockchain assets, right? So talking about proof of work assets or proof of work derived assets like ones with emission contracts tied to proof of work. blocks production such as I don't know auction coin maybe even rights or well maybe currencies with emission contracts with the emission going to miners, right, like some projects did, but only for part of tokens. But if we are talking about whole supply going to miners, then yeah, it's not that different from ERG, even maybe from native token, right, in regards with money production.

So yeah, we have those hard assets, Ergo, other proof of work cryptocurrencies. Well, if they do have good distribution like Bitcoin. Right, then, yeah, maybe we have assets of, I don't know, the different quality, let's say, right? But then, yeah, still for the real world, you need for some expansion, right? You need to introduce trust sometimes. You need to combine trust and collateral and so on. So a variety of options to expand trust.

monetary base or blockchain assets to, well, money being used in the real world. So that's more or less like monetary systems are working in the real world, right? Where you have some, well, monetary base, like M0 aggregates, right? And well, on top of that, you are creating more and more derivative layers but here yeah it's still peer-to-peer right so well it's based on individual choice of security parameters and so on and yeah so it's it's it's a non

It's non-enforceable, right? Also, no actor should force you to accept assets you don't like, right? Like happening with fiat currency, for example, which you have to accept if you run a business in some jurisdiction, for example, right? Yeah, you almost always saw in almost all the jurisdictions, you have to accept fiat currency rights of all that jurisdiction. And yeah, in ChainCash, so yeah, it's kind of free. And yeah, free banking system basically, right? So the different agents are free to issue their money, but then yeah, it's up to you which money to accept. So it's more or less like, well, free banking systems existed in many countries before central banks, well, to power our money issues.

[54:40] **Armeanio**: It's going to be interesting to see. ChainCash, I don't know, could grow a lot of different ways. Like the circle within circles idea is interesting. Looking at how like the shadow banking system will have to retool itself based on like potential changes. And, you know, let's say we do get central bank digital currencies, that's going to be interesting to see how like, you know, shadow banking sides of economy and gray markets, black markets coexist.

within the centralized beast that's coming. It's gonna be an interesting world, my friend. I think you and I will be alive the day that cash disappears, right? And it's quite interesting to game theory out. What comes next? Right. And I think that at some point, like a reversion back to metals makes sense, because what else are you going to have that you can have custody of and you have strong trust assumptions with? I don't know. We're in for an interesting time, I guess.

[55:50] **kushti**: Right, but you can combine blockchains with metals, right? So you may have, I don't know, physical gold, which is secured with algorithmic rights, like what Palmyra is planning to do with lithium rights or to secure lithium which is not produced yet with algorithmic stable coins and similarly you can secure brick of gold which is not delivered yet to your control party with algorithmic stable coin rights and then yeah you use also some escrow contract for security right for for kind of insurance

And then, yeah, so this way you can use metals, right, but with also some additional security provided by blockchain, but also well in a capital-efficient way, right. And then you also can actually issue I don't know, more relaxed money like ChainCash, right? On top of metals secured by stable coins, for example, and so on. You can just issue ChainCash notes on top of algorithmic stable coins and so on. So yeah, a variety of options. And yeah, you can have things done in a pretty capital-efficient way here, right, using clearing, mutual credit clearing and so on.

So not so much backing would be needed even because that's also, well, a hard problem, right? So you may have trustless assets like over collateralized algorithmic stable coins, but they're not capital efficient, right? So you need to do something right to not to use so much of those assets. So to use clearing as much as possible, right? So to minimize amount of stable coins, used over-collateralized stable coins.

[58:32] **Armeanio**: That's an interesting, interesting thought. Going back to the future of Ergo, what would you say is the long-term vision goal plan for the ecosystem community, development community, and how best to engage users and developers to get involved in the vision and the future of building Ergo?

[58:59] **kushti**: Yeah, so I think we actually have discussed, right, different aspects of future of Ergo, such as well, more stable coins, well, tools for monetary expansion, then cross-chaining to bring more assets and also to bring applications to other blockchains. Decentralized onramp, which is getting more and more critically needed, right? Especially, well, with degradation of centralized exchanges we are witnessing.

And then, yeah, well, decentralized marketplaces. What else? There would be needs probably in many areas for off-chain solutions, layer-2 networks, right, for, well, cheap. maybe almost free transactions here also, maybe, well, very fast, right? Well, maybe even sub-blocks would be not fast enough. You may use Lithos and so on.

And yeah, so I think, well, all those things combined and those things are not imaginary, right? prototypes at least for almost all of them. Sometimes we have tooling already available, but just maybe not tested and used much. With all those things we may say that Ergo is actually a kind of end game for crypto. envisioned by godfathers of Bitcoin.

Maybe not in detailed way because they were not capable to figure out details back in 2009, 2008, 2009. Sometimes it's quite funny actually to read the writings as well as, I don't know, even earlier writings from 2000s like different Cypherpunk writings on future of peer-to-peer digital cash. But yeah, now I think we have a pretty well-established and detailed approach, which is finally allowing to achieve dreams from 2000s.

And yeah, that's what we need for more developers, enthusiasts, monetary hackers, jazz hackers. So well, enthusiasts, running experience and so on.

[62:38] **Armeanio**: No, I think at some point, you know, life is a circle. Right. So I think at some point, you know, this idea of like, I don't know, wrappers with a lot of different control points on top of wrappers with a lot of different control points will be problematic. Right. And when it becomes problematic, then this idea of, you know, peer to peer finance between you and me with nobody else in the middle will become more attractive.

I guess, I don't know, there's always a lot of hype and marketing and I don't know, salesmanship, guruing in the crypto space. But I think at the end of the day, that's ultimately the kind of first principles approach is to stay low and peer to peer. system. And, you know, I do hope that, you know, perhaps 2025, perhaps 2026, we start to explore, you know, perhaps enhancements in privacy, new Sigma protocols being supported, etc. I don't know for there yet. But, you know, it seems like we have a foundation where, you know, that very well could be 7.0 or 8.0 or whatever. Let's see.

[64:03] **kushti**: Yeah, so I guess sigma chains or layer 2s could be useful for privacy, right? Especially if it's possible to break link between well, entering and exiting layer 2, which should be possible in Ergo, by the way. For example, you may enter layer 2. with the condition to exit to stealth address, which is what I'm thinking about a little bit. But yeah, I need to write down all those things. But yeah, well, it would be good to get more researchers' rights, also hacking around all that stuff. Absolutely. So yeah, well, going back.

So yeah, I think in 2025 it is critically needed to get more actors, more organizations, maybe even in the Ergo ecosystem. And it is critically needed to get some more researchers and yeah, more developers, core developers, application developers. and, yeah, well, more users, right, more, well, enthusiasts, more teachers, right, explaining, well, technology, right, to the masses.

[65:52] **Armeanio**: I think ultimately that might be the starting point, right? If I look back at the history of Ergo so far, it seems as though DECO was actually one of the biggest like aggravators and motivators for growth and development expansion. Just kind of that free YouTube course where, you know, covered the like base foundations of Ergo UTXO building on Ergo sigma etc so i i think that's always going to be something we should be really mindful of is kind of that intro ramp and education for people out there that you know are interested because i don't know it's

I don't want to say crypto has a lot of foolish teachers around but it's a crazy goddamn space my friend.

[66:52] **kushti**: So I think there should be focus in 2025 on, well, growing a new generation of Sigmanauts, right? So it's always needed. And yeah, well, I think that's, yes, sometimes it's missed, right? So that's, yeah, well, for a Sigmanaut, yeah, the first goal should be to I don't know, grow replacements, right? Well, expand the movement.

[67:30] **Armeanio**: Yeah, I really hope that through time we become less important. That would be awesome to see.

[67:39] **kushti**: All right, so yeah, well, let's have exciting 2025. I'm pretty sure it will be pretty crazy, but hopefully exciting here.

[67:52] **Armeanio**: Buckle up, wear a helmet, let's have some fun.

[67:56] **kushti**: All right, bye everybody.
