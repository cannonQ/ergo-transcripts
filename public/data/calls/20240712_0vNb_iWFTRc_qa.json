      "asker": "qx()",
      "answer": "Rosen ensures assets trade one-to-one and are backed by something real. Unlike exchanges that have private internal ledgers where they could theoretically add extra assets, Rosen provides transparency. As long as exchanges can cover withdrawals, we can't tell if their private ledger matches the public blockchain ledger, but Rosen addresses this transparently.",

This allows distributing assets via Ergo blockchain and Rosen cross-chain, managing liquidity in a single hub for better market efficiency and arbitrage opportunities.",

      "question": "How will Rosen Fast work for faster cross-chain transfers?",
      "asker": "qx()",
      "answer": "Rosen Fast creates a fast swap market around Rosen. Once funds enter the system, people can provide liquidity for faster settlement at a premium. For example, if you send 10 ERGs through, someone can charge 10.X ERG to speed up delivery while the original 10 ERG moves through the slower Rosen protocol. It's like paying extra for same-day delivery versus waiting three days.",

      "asker": "Savonarola Labs",
      "answer": "Before supporting USDT, we should test what happens if we send transactions through Tornado Cash to see the response, since USDT addresses can be blocked. Being a non-bearer asset, USDT has attack vectors that are very real and potentially dangerous. We should understand these risks and try to break the system first rather than just saying we support USDT.",

      "question": "Why did SigmaUSD trade above $1 on Spectrum?",
      "asker": "CannonQ",
      "answer": "In the bank, SigmaUSD is always $1 if it's mintable. On Spectrum it can trade above $1 due to magic constants in the protocol like the 400% ratio. When it's not mintable in the bank and current holders aren't redeeming, the price can go above $1. This is why mgPai removed magic constants in the new Gluon protocol to let markets find equilibrium naturally.",
