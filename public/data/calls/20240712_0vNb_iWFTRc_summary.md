## Notable Quotes

**kushti on community engagement**: "I think actually, well, it's now quite common, right? So before the COVID pandemic, it was quite an exotic choice still, right? But now I think, well, it's very widespread and very well understood to have online events. Yeah. And so they're working better if we're talking about inclusion."

**Joe on USDT integration**: "Well, I think that if we do experiment with USDT, the first thing we should do is send a transaction through Tornado Cash and see what happens... if we're going to try to build a resilient system, we should probably have some idea what the assumptions of that are."

**qx() on educational blockchain use**: "The important thing to me is that we're presenting the students with one immutable source of governance. So no matter what happens, out of our hands, out of administration's hand, these students can make decisions that hopefully are enacted and effective on chain without our influence."
