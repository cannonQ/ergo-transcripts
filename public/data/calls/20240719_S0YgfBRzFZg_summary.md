## Notable Quotes

**On Ergo's Philosophy**: "If you're into crypto purely for speculation and purely comparing Ergo to chains like Solana... you're in the wrong blockchain. Ergo is a long arc. All the growth you see here is organic." - Dan Friedman

**On Decentralization**: "When you build a system like Ergo, as Joe says, you're building for war. It shouldn't fucking matter. That's the whole point of this system is that it shouldn't matter if the US government hates Ergo... They can't fucking stop it." - qx()

**On Ecosystem Growth**: "I see the ecosystem has grown exponentially since last year. It has matured. But sometimes the price doesn't reflect that... In a volatile environment, what you have to look at is what has the longer arc." - Dan Friedman
