# Marketing Content Extraction: Lithos Community Call

## 1. Twitter Thread (6 tweets)

**Tweet 1:**
🧵 THREAD: Lithos is revolutionizing proof-of-work mining with the first truly decentralized mining pools. @CheeseEnthusiast just unveiled how Non-Interactive Share Proofs (NISPs) compress millions of shares into ~10 proofs, enabling full on-chain transparency. Testnet launches Nov 2nd 👇

**Tweet 2:**
Traditional mining pools are black boxes with complete control over payments & block production. They can censor transactions, manipulate rewards, and concentrate power in few hands—exactly what Satoshi's vision sought to prevent.

**Tweet 3:**
Lithos solves this with collateralized mining pools: Third-party ERG holders provide block rewards upfront, miners get instant payments, and most importantly—miners maintain full control over transaction selection and block production. No more censorship.

**Tweet 4:**
The breakthrough: NISPs use mathematical proofs (borrowed from NIPoPoW concepts) to verify mining work with just 10 high-difficulty shares instead of storing millions on-chain. Fraud proofs ensure honesty while keeping costs minimal.

**Tweet 5:**
Game-changer: Lithos is blockchain agnostic. You can mine Bitcoin, Litecoin, or other PoW chains through decentralized pools powered by Ergo smart contracts. Plus miners capture MEV rewards and storage rent that pools typically keep.

**Tweet 6:**
Testnet launches week of November 2nd with Rigel & NBMiner support. Local stratum = zero stale shares. Miners can even adjust their own difficulty for risk/reward tradeoffs. The future of decentralized mining starts now.

## 2. Quotable Moments

**Quote 1:**
*"The goal of Lithos is really to try and decentralize all aspects of the mining pool and make sure that miners can mine to pools in a way that still allows them to get their consistent payments. But at the same time, do it in a decentralized manner."*
- Cheese Enthusiast
- Context: Defining Lithos' core mission

**Quote 2:**
*"Mining pools have complete control over payments and block production... they can essentially go into their database, see whatever shares that a miner produced, and they can change it on the fly to whatever they want."*
- Cheese Enthusiast
- Context: Problems with centralized mining pools

**Quote 3:**
*"Non-interactive share proofs are essentially a way to compress the amount of work that a miner produced into a small handful of shares, and then that handful of shares can be verified on the blockchain using various smart contracts."*
- Cheese Enthusiast
- Context: Technical innovation breakthrough

**Quote 4:**
*"We can have smart contracts on the Ergo blockchain, which allow you to mine in a decentralized manner while still mining to Bitcoin."*
- Cheese Enthusiast
- Context: Blockchain agnostic capabilities
