## Notable Quotes

**kushti on Ergo's mission**: "The idea of crypto, I think, is to provide counter-cyclical tooling to get out of shocks and crashes on traditional markets, let's say. And yeah, I think the Ergo movement should be the first, so it should realize the original vision after all."

**Dan Friedman on business viability**: "I think it's more meaningful for Ergo to be, to be the engine, you know, for Ergo to be powering things like Rosen, things like Palmyra, things that are actually, or tools that are actually meant for mainstream and cross chain utility, which is where, you know, which where the future is, I think."

**qx() on community engagement**: "I think you'll find that the people in Ergo right now are here for reasons that they're fulfilled by seeing everyday progress of Ergo... if you're here for the reasons of building and Ergo then you're gonna have fun every fucking day."
