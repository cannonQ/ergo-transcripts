# Marketing Content from Ergo Community Call - October 24, 2025

## 1. Twitter Thread

**Tweet 1 (Hook):**
kushti has coined a new term for the current market phase: "Rug Season" 🧵

With Kadena's $200M → $20M collapse and centralized projects falling like dominoes, we're witnessing the inevitable result of corporate-controlled blockchains vs. true community governance.

**Tweet 2:**
"When you know that the company is disappearing, no one is interested in good tech" - kushti on Kadena's collapse

This is why community-driven development matters. Ergo has thrived for 6+ years without depending on any single corporate entity.

**Tweet 3:**
The difference between Ergo and corporate chains:
• Ergo: Community funded with <5% premine, survived multiple bear markets
• Corporate chains: $200M raised, collapse when the company fails
• Ergo Foundation was built TO fade away, not to control forever

**Tweet 4:**
While centralized exchanges extract wealth through leverage trading and token dumps, Ergo is building sustainable tools:
• Rosen Bridge for cross-chain liquidity
• Machina Finance for automated market making
• SigmaFi for real DeFi opportunities

**Tweet 5:**
"We're building a cathedral, not a company. Something that's going to last for hundreds of years like Unix" - Grayman

This is infrastructure thinking vs. pump-and-dump mentality.

**Tweet 6:**
Node 6 is live, Lithos testnet needs miners in November, and a new community website with "sci-fi punk" aesthetic is ready to launch.

Building continues regardless of market conditions. 🔧

**Tweet 7:**
Don't look for leaders in crypto. Lead yourself and seek out peers.

The future belongs to truly decentralized platforms that can't be rugged by corporate decisions.

Welcome to #RugSeason. Ergo has been ready.
