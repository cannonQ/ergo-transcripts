## Notable Quotes

**qx()** on proof of work accessibility: *"proof of work gives you the ability gives anybody the ability to enter the ecosystem on their own terms at their own rate, you know, so if you have a ton of money, or you have the resources to buy GPUs in mind and support the network that way, then that's great. Or if you have an old gaming rig that you're just kicking around, and you just fire it up"*

**Marc the Shark** on exchange listings strategy: *"we really need to be thinking about this as we are setting up the framework for when people finally realize what Ergo is and why they need it. And then at that point, they're going to be able to access it in the United States, they're going to be able to access it in Indonesia"*
