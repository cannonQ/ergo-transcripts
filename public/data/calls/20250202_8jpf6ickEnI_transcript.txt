[00:11] **qx()**: Hello, and welcome back to the Ergo Dev Update.

[00:18] **qx()**: I thought no better way to bring this back after a few months of hiatus than to have the original, the OG, sipping on his amber ale, Joseph Armeanio.

[00:31] **Armeanio**: Good to be back.

[00:32] **qx()**: How you doing, sir?

[00:34] **Armeanio**: Good. Cheers, everybody. It's nice to be back on the Dev Update. What's new in crypto land these days?

[00:42] **qx()**: Goodness. Wow. I don't know where to start, Joe. I don't know where to start.

[00:48] **Armeanio**: All right. What pops in your head first, I guess. And we'll just paddle forward from there.

[00:53] **qx()**: Well, let me I got something. All right. So here's here. So I've, a lot of you watching maybe know that I've launched the BRICK token. But the funny thing is, let me open my I'm open my email here because I want to read a verbatim. So I have to, you know, you kind of have to launch this stuff and send out mass emails to students, which also hit faculty, which also has staff.

[01:20] **qx()**: So when I'm writing this thing, I'm writing about blockchain usage. I'm writing about Ergo platform and why we chose to use it for this purpose. I get a whole email done and I'm thinking for a second, Oh man, it still reads like, Oh, you're going to get airdropped and that kind of thing. And it just triggers these things in my head, like these meme token crap scams kind of stuff.

[01:42] **qx()**: So I literally, I put a message at the end. Let me find it. I put one sentence at the end of talking about Ergo, I said, and yes, we're fully aware of how ridiculous 90% of the blockchain antics have been. So welcome to some actual meaningful usage of this technology.

[02:03] **qx()**: So it's so sad that I have to put that in. And then after that, I see like, what was it? A couple of days ago, a Senator released a token, USA token or something like that. And we're going to make this the best financial.

[02:15] **Armeanio**: Every micro celebrity and influencer out there has their own thing now, huh? It's unexpected, I guess.

[02:23] **qx()**: It is. I mean, this happens in the fiat world all the time, right? So why would we not expect it here in the crypto space?

[02:30] **Armeanio**: I think that you just have to say, okay, well, as soon as you create something like that, what are you really doing as you're creating a currency war, right? And so then the assumption is going to be that people are going to at some point, move towards the better currency. I don't see it as really any more complicated than that. It's a weird space.

[03:00] **qx()**: We're in weird time but it is there's really there's really nothing like new under the sun right just new front end I'm just waiting for like a senator to do something on pump fun or something That's the next step right so that got me thinking they got me thinking too like what's

[03:29] **qx()**: And I hope no central exchanges are watching this right now, but I'm thinking what's besides a fiat on ramp? What's the usage? What's a forecast for a central exchange in the future? You know, the only thing that can come to my mind to think of what these things will evolve into in the future. The only thing that came to my mind is most of these things are just going to be

[03:49] **qx()**: online casinos are going to devolve into an online casino or evolve into an online casino. You're gonna put your money up there. They're not going to want you to move it anywhere else because you're there. You know, you're their cash cow. And then they're going to want you to spend it there. So what else, they're going to turn into some sort of payment portal where everything comes to then you buy things you gamble.

[04:10] **Armeanio**: Yeah, I mean, like, I don't know, I have my own thoughts. I would say that yeah, okay, you're probably going to see a lot of, I don't know, ramping, which, one of the useful things about centralized stable coins is they have the ability to sink liquidity into the bond market, right? So if you look at USDC, USDT, what are they holding? Government bonds, right?

[04:42] **Armeanio**: So it is somewhat interesting to say, okay, well, if I'm in government and I have a lot of debt that I have to roll over. Having these new ways of sinking liquidity into the bond market to like offset demand based on the amount of debt I need to roll over might make sense, right?

[05:02] **Armeanio**: Then you also have like the custodial aspect I think is kind of interesting, right? Now you can say like Coinbase is building out this entire suite that's like onboarding I guess more traditional markets and they're the ultimately like the key holder in that situation. So maybe that's useful for retail, but that's not new either. I think a lot of people have just used exchanges as their wallet, hoping they didn't get hacked.

[05:36] **qx()**: A lot of people just don't have the ability to understand what self custody is. I mean, I have these people that I know that were family members from marriage are into crypto before I was. And, they called me the other day to help them, recover funds from whatever that payout was. It wasn't Mt. Gox, but one of those kind of things where they're letting you go in and pull out some USDT or something like that in a fraction of what you actually originally had.

[06:08] **qx()**: So one of those things that I was helping them pull it out and I was like, what's your address? And they're like, Oh, my Coinbase address is this. I was like, No, no, what's your, what's your wallet address yourself? Something like you have a hardware key or anything like that? Oh, no, I just keep it on the exchange. So it's unfortunately just the exchanges job, right? It's a keep you there, unfortunately, and people don't educate beyond that.

[06:29] **Armeanio**: So yeah. I mean, the space is weird, man. Like I onboarded into crypto by syncing nodes. Like that was like my first activity or touchpoint.

[06:44] **qx()**: Was that your first wallet? A node wallet?

[06:46] **Armeanio**: Yeah, yeah. I was like, wow, this Bitcoin thing is pretty interesting. I'm going to sync a node.

[06:51] **qx()**: Oh, wow, nice.

[06:52] **Armeanio**: But that's kind of very foreign. Now it's like the president has a shit coin, everybody, quick. I don't know what to say. Like those things happen. I'm like.

[07:11] **qx()**: It's not even a sane response to that kind of thing. The president of the United States is rugged. Probably not.

[07:18] **Armeanio**: Let's be honest. I don't see him having like, Oh, no, not him specifically right now.

[07:23] **qx()**: He's not running the token himself. But it's whatever whoever he's hired or whoever he's given permission to do this.

[07:29] **Armeanio**: I'm sure that's always the downside is there's always coat tailors. Somebody that's just around him that wants to leverage that power privilege position, whatever. But that's not new either.

[07:42] **qx()**: No, no, that's true. It's just blatant in the open, I guess. I guess it's transparent, right? That's hell of a transparent.

[07:51] **Armeanio**: It seems to have really destroyed the, I don't know, the meme narrative that was going there for a bit. I guess a lot of people put their liquidity into the Trump token and then, that started dumping on everybody and it seems to have pulled a lot of liquidity out of other meme projects and Who knows maybe Donald Trump destroyed shit coins, right?

[08:20] **qx()**: That's kind of a So went down 20% or something when when the Trump token dumped or something I forget I have something like that. Yeah

[08:30] **Armeanio**: It's a weird space like that. I mean, on one hand, it's like we have these people that are saying, hey, we're going to try to build systems with open source code that redistribute kind of power assumptions and oftentimes offer like privacy and utility. And then on the other side, you have users that don't care about code at all. I mean, a lot of times it's just a picture. They don't really care about assumptions. They don't really care about privacy. They don't really care about, well, much other than, is it green or red? And these things happen.

[09:11] **Armeanio**: I mean, the downside to financial nihilism is equal to the upside, which is kind of infinite. So there you go.

[09:25] **qx()**: Well, in these situations, I tend to find myself just putting my head down and being on whatever track I was on before for what reason I was on before. And that's building on Ergo, right? That's finding real life use cases for Ergo, finding actual meaningful, as I said, reasons to utilize the blockchain. And the other stuff's just noise to me. It feels temporary, right? It feels like, OK, this is just the windstorm blowing over. This is a hype. This is extra value extraction. This is what these people are going to do.

[10:03] **qx()**: Eventually, they're going to run out of people to, maybe hopefully they're going to run out of people to fleece down those kind of numbers. And then, we'll still be there. And projects like Ergo are still going to be there building and way ahead of the game who are just trying to value extract. So that's the way I look at it.

[10:23] **Armeanio**: I think that if you're going to look at how you deal with things in life, you got to have humor. Otherwise, it is a crazy space. A lot of the times, if I'm talking to like your average person, I just say, Hey, I helped contribute to open source software. And they say, Oh, well, what's that? And it's like, well, it's free. You can look inside of it and understand it. And I start talking about closed versus open systems.

[10:54] **Armeanio**: Now I'm sure there are a lot of people that their first touch point in crypto is. A lot of these key opinion leaders who, I don't know, based on the look of it, were like fatherless or something. But I'm just honest, and yeah, I don't know. It's a weird space. And I think everybody should have fair warning about that. And hopefully, people do, that there is a lot of just grift, vapor world.

[11:39] **qx()**: So have we been in a situation historically? And my memory is usually always hard to remember these kind of things, even things I read in history, historically of this kind of not necessarily in the financial market, but in other markets.

[11:55] **Armeanio**: It's been free banking before. where you have a bunch of people creating their own personal currencies and usually it's rampant with inflations and scams and things to blow up. But I think that usually we didn't have the technology to actually see and understand it. Now we actually do, which is fascinating, right? Like you can watch, I don't know, say you pick a scam project on some chain. You can actually look.

[12:28] **qx()**: Throw dirt. You'll hit one, right? It doesn't matter.

[12:30] **Armeanio**: I mean, you can understand distribution. You can understand like an element of what's happening not that people pay attention or that it doesn't matter I mean, it's the same thing.

[12:39] **qx()**: I mean with chains, right? We have full transparency. We see what's locked. We see what's not locked We see how many people are holding the majority of the Treasury. It doesn't matter the same thing happens That would happen in a closed system where people are fleeced out in the fiat system world So it's the in that case. I feel like for the normal person 90% of the people it doesn't matter

[13:02] **qx()**: You know, they don't understand what it means that, oh, the token holder for the Trump token owns 80%, has 80% of the tokens ready to dump into the buy pressure kind of thing. So I don't know.

[13:18] **Armeanio**: Always great power comes great responsibility.

[13:22] **qx()**: I don't know. I just think Ergo has always been in the right place. It doesn't matter if there's a hurricane out there or a tornado and people are falling for anything. Ergo is still steadily building and doing, I think, the right thing.

[13:38] **Armeanio**: I think we just need to look at it from the perspective of we're trying to create an open neutral network, right? And deliver assumptions that people that want to understand will, right? Like, just because blockchain is available to everybody, probably doesn't mean everybody should use it at this point, right? But it's there, right? Having the code open and available to everybody doesn't necessarily mean that much to many people, but it's there.

[14:18] **qx()**: There are ways to implement it too that are transparent to the user, but still beneficial in the sense of using the blockchain like when we were releasing the BRICK token.

[14:28] **Armeanio**: Listen, technology will not solve human nature. That's the end all be all of this discussion is that you have that side of human nature where people will want money in profit for no work, no input. We'll have people that will try to grift other people and try to take advantage of them.

[14:56] **Armeanio**: I think ultimately it's about creating clear trust assumptions that are available for people that appreciate that. At this point, many people won't. But historically in crypto, the most valuable marketing moments are not from the industry itself. It's when there is some bellwether event outside of crypto, whether it's Cyprus screws over their depositors or Canada starts censoring truckers' bank accounts. And then people start saying, hey, wait a second, what's the assumption that I have as a user in this system? And they start looking for something better. That's what drives people into really looking at, I guess, systems that distribute power.

[15:49] **qx()**: So we have a tough battle with crypto though, right? Because I don't think so. It is, I think it's inevitable, but I think it's a road ahead because those people who are debanked or feel strangled by that kind of thing, like you just mentioned, They're not going to jump into something that all they've heard about is a scam or rugpulls or that kind of thing, or, the consensus of what crypto is.

[16:17] **Armeanio**: That's the beauty of an open network in a way. Like if you have some regulatory body that's like, Hey everybody, you have to behave and act in a certain way. You just kind of defeated the point. So that's the downside to not having censorship. That's the downside to not having a central party that's babysitting everybody. And you just have to be aware of that. Right. And that's always going to be a risk in an open system.

[16:51] **Armeanio**: So to some degree, I would say, yeah, you should approach these things with like an element of caution and be aware of pretentious malicious actors, but the system itself is designed with pretty clear assumptions of how it works in the face of a malicious actor. That's more or less the point.

[17:18] **qx()**: Yeah, I'm looking at, well, you're talking, I'm looking at looking at DuckPools and I see that, it's crazy to me that Sigmanauts pool and DuckPools has an APY of 28.9%. Like in any market, any like sane market, that's an amazing yield return, right? But in crypto, you have to like remind people that it's there, that's.

[17:50] **Armeanio**: I mean, I think you need to recognize that yield is more or less an open term in crypto. And it's important to understand like where yield comes from first and foremost, right? Like 28%, real yield is pretty impressive. But when you look at it side by side versus like money printing yield from some token that just, put your token here and give you more tokens. You know, it is true. You got to know where your yield comes from. Otherwise you might be the yield, right?

[18:40] **qx()**: Yeah. Let me show this, Joe. We'll take a break for a second. I'm going to switch to something just to show everybody. Let's see if I can switch to this. Oh, fantastic.

[18:54] **qx()**: All right. So here's an example. So I just want to show people how simple we've tried to make it for students who are using BRICK token to pay for their plots for that incentive. So we filled out the information. We've uploaded our plot. We're choosing blockchain payment here. We're submitting the print job, and gosh, I hope I didn't submit something big. Let's see. No, that was nice and small.

[19:20] **qx()**: OK, so it instructs you to go to the blockchain server on Discord. And if you'll notice, there's a new message in blockchain payments. And there we go. It tells me that it's me, that it's six bucks, and it's either 4.4 ERG or 54 BRICK. So I just copy the BRICK. And before I do that, let's go to the admin side. You can see that my print is not there, right? This is what the backend admin sees. So it's not released yet.

[19:51] **qx()**: So as soon as we hit this, I have sent the wallet the appropriate amount of BRICK. And I guess we wait two minutes. We'll check back in a little bit. We'll see that that print should be released soon on this page.

[20:11] **qx()**: So the reason I'm showing this is because what I mentioned earlier is that I don't think you need to necessarily with everybody, dive them into, not everybody needs like, okay, here's your wallet, here's your seed phrase, maybe explain how that works. But an intro to the blockchain can be as easy as this, right? None of these students are knowing, essentially, I mean, in the explanation video, I tell them, here's how you setup, here's what a seed phrase is, that kind of thing. But they don't need to setup a wallet, right? If they're doing these kind of simple

[20:44] **qx()**: back and forth, peer-to-peer payments, this kind of simple method, of course. All they're using is Tipperbot. To them, the blockchain is very transparent. For all they know, it's some Discord app that they're running on, right? But we're running it on the blockchain, on peer-to-peer nodes, so that, let's say something bad happens, right? Let's say somebody takes my token and makes an ERG pair with it on Mew or something.

[21:11] **qx()**: That's something I don't want to happen because I don't want to deal with tax issues in Cornell. So we'll just nuke it, make a new token, airdrop it to everybody except that asshole who made the trading pair against our wishes on the DEX, essentially, and just reprogram that with a couple lines of programming into our backend, and that's it. So that's the beauty of the blockchain. It's such a benefit to at least the developers and the tooling that Ergo has. And to the students, it can be very transparent and extremely robust and simple to use.

[21:45] **Armeanio**: So I think there's a huge use case in the Ergo ecosystem. I mean, that's kind of where you get into this idea of stateless clients or ultra light clients. where, you know, abstraction usually means you're putting additional layers of trust in between users and the blockchain, right? So it's like you're tracking to a higher layer, you're kind of further away from, I guess, optimal security assumptions. And our ability to build low, potentially with like one click

[22:22] **Armeanio**: applications where people don't necessarily need to know that they're basically operating with the assumptions of a full node is pretty magic. I think that's a huge green area for the Ergo ecosystem to explore as a whole and I really think that sub-blocks will be a driver of that because then you're no longer waiting for block time, which again, if you're talking about general users, I'd say a lot of them don't understand the assumption of settlement with no have no clue what that is bank money anyway, I mean,

[23:01] **qx()**: Well, even, even people in the blockchain, they don't understand why an exchange would want 10 blocks on Ergo or 20 blocks on Ergo or, a couple blocks on Bitcoin or a couple on Ethereum. They don't understand why that's important and what that means for finality.

[23:16] **Armeanio**: Well, go ask, go ask your mother what, settlement looks like when you're trading a stock. I have no idea. Most of them, right?

[23:23] **qx()**: No, right. with stocks, with stocks, it gets hairy, right? Because, they're supposed to transfer ownership physically, right, at some point, or electronically. And then then you have people lending out those shares that you're actually having on their platform without your knowledge, or you sign something, you clicked, okay, on a box somewhere, and now they can lend your shares out to other people. So you get these divisions. So that's insane. So

[23:47] **Armeanio**: No, but it's the same concept really. I mean, most people that operate within traditional finance have no idea what kind of demon is behind that door, right? And that's true with the banking system. That's true with most traditional markets and, more or less people don't care. Right. They just have an assumption. Okay. Well, it should work and, hopefully things settle properly. Right. And if they don't, that's always its own rabbit hole. But I don't think that's going to change.

[24:23] **Armeanio**: Like we can have a system with clear assumptions of settlement and kind of looking at finality of proof of work. blah, blah, blah, most general end users are not going to really dive into that rabbit hole. And I think we can still deliver optimal security assumptions without them needing to know. Which, I think that's like the best long-term course to say, okay, well, if we're gonna look at this as a global, open, neutral network, how do we protect users? and try to build, systems that we would want to use understanding kind of the back into the system itself.

[25:09] **qx()**: Yeah. It still seems so far away. But but it seems it seems doable. That's for sure. Or else I wouldn't be doing this there.

[25:20] **Armeanio**: I'm sure, I have no idea how complicated legacy tech stacks are at this point. how many people does it keep to keep it from self-destructing. Cause a lot of them are quite old, right? They've been built on for years and years and years and years and years. And that's hard to say you get into, some complexity with legacy software that, I wouldn't want to do that. I wouldn't want to manage it or maintain it. So let's see.

[25:52] **qx()**: So speaking of circumventing banks and central exchanges, how is how's Rosen going, Joe?

[26:02] **Armeanio**: Good. Listen, Rosen requires a lot of testing, right? Like, like open source software is not sexy business. I hate to I hate to inform everybody out there. No, it's not.

[26:18] **qx()**: It is tough struggle. Yep.

[26:20] **Armeanio**: It is the least sexy thing ever because you need to back test it to where you release your code to the public and you don't have vulnerabilities, both kind of in the system that can be exploited. And it takes a lot of testing, right? Build, test, fix, build, test, fix, build, test, fix, build, test, fix. It is not exciting work, but I do think that the capabilities if we build a lot of these systems are pretty awesome.

[26:54] **Armeanio**: So we did have a bug show up in one of the rounds of testing in Binance Smart Chain. And so then it took a week to say, hey, we need to first figure out why this is happening and then patch it and then run end-to-end tests. And I think we're good on that. So I'm going to say Binance soon, TM, right? But to me, it's just funny because ever since I've kind of been around publicly, that's probably one of the most

[27:23] **Armeanio**: I'm like, listen, this is not, this is not Asian Jesus, right? He's not even involved anymore. Anyway, but, so for me, it's, it's like a spiritual victory to be able to say, okay, everybody gets Binance and BSC environment now.

[27:47] **qx()**: I think, I think, I think at least the, the core people in Ergo now, at least have finally understood what a listing means, right? Not that it's, that it's not a, let's pump it a couple bucks because the listing is coming and that's, sure. They're going to profit off whatever they're buying and selling low, buying high, selling low. Or the reverse, but I think I really think at least the sentiment seems to be that people are now understanding that listings are about access, right? It's about access to with cracking. It's about access to US customers and just getting it so that people have a way on to the Ergo blockchain from there. So I'm really happy at the sentiment there because you're right.

[28:29] **Armeanio**: And I think that even Rosen has had pretty decent ERG depth on Cardano like that becomes an easier on ramp.

[28:37] **qx()**: And that's what we said to, that's what we said to, oh gosh, what's his name? I've lost track of all the Kraken people that we've been talking to. Peter, that's his name, Peter Dimitrakos. So that's exactly what we said to Peter, right? We have as much liquidity out there on the Cardano chain that we do, and at least it was on Gate, a couple other exchanges put together. So Gate put in two applications recently, and I pinged the guy and he said, thanks. Hopefully we hear something back soon from that to get better access.

[29:15] **Armeanio**: I know I'd love to Yeah, I would definitely say that like historically that's that's been one that I tend to favor. It's an interesting business. They've been in I don't know, position of pressure, at least for the last, like, political environment. And it's interesting to see how that's going to change moving forward for them, to be honest. I know that, like, they're bringing back staking products, which may or may not even be good for proof of stake chains. But, it certainly gives them a little bit more room to try to innovate and compete and, kind of build their own thing. Let's see.

[30:01] **qx()**: Let's see. It'll be interesting. jury's out for me about what they'll turn into or what they'll be in the far future.

[30:09] **Armeanio**: But I think that sometimes we forget how small of a space we are.

[30:14] **qx()**: That is true, too.

[30:16] **Armeanio**: Like crypto is its own little niche environment where it is true that, if we do have, changes to where you can, open up a bank rails from your financial institution to the back end of chains, even if it is, some centralized shit. that certainly opens the competition, wide beyond where it is now. And, considering, the financial depth of the purse of some of the institutions around, Coinbase is small beans compared to some of the larger competitors. So let's see. Let's see. it's one of those things where yes, they have an element of like,

[31:02] **Armeanio**: I don't know. They have Head Start, but in terms of raw consumer base.

[31:07] **qx()**: They don't have that. That's for sure.

[31:08] **Armeanio**: They don't have anything. They're a middle man. And if things move to where, the bank infrastructure has some access into crypto land, Rosen will back end it. Like that'll be a priority.

[31:23] **qx()**: Yeah. Let's take Bank of America Chase, right? Let's decided to do direct Vietnam ramps to places from the bank, Kraken would be shitting their pants.

[31:34] **Armeanio**: They do not have the element of power that they, appear to have. The only thing they have right now is, is a head start and like they've had a certain like regulatory advantage that might disappear. So it might be a double edged sword for them actually improved, regulatory environment. Let's see. Business can be like that sometimes, right? Where, it's like, wow, this is going to be great for this market. And it's like, well, actually it just opened the market. So now you actually have to compete. Let's see.

[32:06] **qx()**: Well, speaking of sub-blocks, it would have been nice to have sub-blocks tonight because we got a long block. So I'm waiting to show you the other end of this process, but we got quite a long one.

[32:18] **Armeanio**: One of the assumptions everybody should have in life. I always do. Whenever I'm trying to do something and I have something else to do, it's always like the long block.

[32:28] **qx()**: A watched block never prints, right?

[32:32] **Armeanio**: Yeah, you just don't look. You have to pretend.

[32:35] **qx()**: I've been refreshing for 10 minutes now.

[32:37] **Armeanio**: Yeah, don't look. You're making it longer now.

[32:40] **qx()**: Damn it.

[32:40] **Armeanio**: Difficulty adjustments are going up every time you hit refresh.

[32:43] **qx()**: That is true. That is true. All right, let's jump in to see what we've got here in the dev update this week. And I'll keep the other thing in the background and pop over to it when it confirms.

[32:59] **qx()**: All right, I'll start off.

[33:03] **Armeanio**: Go for it.

[33:04] **qx()**: We've got C8 with Dexy Gold integration, ETA, a few weeks. How's that a Rosen a few weeks or you think a legitimate few weeks, Joe?

[33:15] **Armeanio**: It's done when it's done.

[33:18] **qx()**: It's like something like that. So Donnie's got porting end user relevant Scala tester JS mock chain done UI concept for user swap liquidity interaction. Don't want to five lib level actions LP swap ERG Dexy Gold remaining. Bank freemint, bank payment, LP mint liquidity tokens, LP redeem liquidity tokens, other things required for release, mempool server integration, and UI integration miscellaneous, looking into ErgyPay integration.

[33:47] **qx()**: That's always great. I always forget, at least, how much of the world is on mobile phones. So that kind of stuff is necessary.

[33:55] **Armeanio**: Actually, that's one thing that surprises me always. I don't know. Maybe I'm old. Maybe I just lose my phone too much. But for me, it's like that is a terrible idea. Like the last cell phone I had a rental with my car. Why would I want to put my money?

[34:10] **qx()**: Oh, here we go, Joe. It worked. We got a confirmed block. So as soon as the block is confirmed, The plot then shows up here. So I have a scanner scanning every like 10 seconds to make sure the payment was made and it was confirmed. And then the students, the student workers that we have can then plot this. So I'm going to delete this before my silly student waste paper plot. Let's go back up to this.

[34:36] **qx()**: All right. You've got the, you've got the next one with kushti, the man himself.

[34:40] **Armeanio**: All right, so we're talking about input ordering blocks. He's got transactions packed into the input blocks properly with ordering full block structures making progress. Linking also works now in local miner-based DevNet. He's doing an API for best input block field and added to the info made. So yeah, with Sigma, it looks like all issues found in Sigma 6.0 have been fixed. So we're going to proceed with the public test net activation.

[35:12] **qx()**: Awesome. Yeah, he's going to send me that file today or tomorrow, I think. And we're down to one miner on test net, just to make it easy. And I'm going to spin that 6.0 up and mine to it. And then he's going to do some tests. So really excited about that.

[35:34] **qx()**: All right, we've got Anon BR from the Nautilus team for Fleet SDK, version 0.8.2 release, fixed zigzag encoding for ascent type, fixed signed spite encoding, added fuzzing tests for all numeric types. I like the way Anon talks. Improved round-trip tests by adding sigma state JS serializer comparison to ensure that encoding decoding output is the same in both libs.

[36:04] **qx()**: For Nautilus, finished the rework of most of the most complex and time-consuming component in Nautilus, the transaction sign component. Migrated from dialogue to drawer component for improved mobile experience. Added several minor UI fixes and code quality improvements.

[36:21] **Armeanio**: Awesome. Well, it looks like next we're going to cover ChainCash.

[36:26] **qx()**: Oh, yeah. Looks like kushti removed the refund-related registers and actions. as refund can be replaced with note redemption, added note registration contract. And as always, he's continuing to think about different L2 options.

[36:43] **Armeanio**: One of the big benefits of Ergo is that we have a footprint in the Bitcoin design space. And there's a huge mind share out there in terms of potential ways to build on top of Bitcoin or improve Bitcoin. generally never go anywhere, but it creates a huge research and mind share space that we can potentially draw from. And it's nice to see, Cardano is probably, ahead of us as well, with Midgard and Hydra and different layer two options. So it does give us like a nice knowledge base to build from, which, sometimes that's a great resource in engineering.

[37:32] **qx()**: All right, what else do we have here? Oh, kushti's done SigmaUSD Oracle Pool and SigmaUSD Bank Update and managed to update Oracle Pool in the testnet to v1 with update contract allowing for the update to v2. Next is mainnet update. Let's do a mainnet update to the same contract for now and continue discussions about limits.

[37:51] **qx()**: Yeah, that's going to be a nice coordinated test. We have to drop down to, I believe, four SigmaUSD Oracle members, maybe even three, to test it out, update the code all at once to make sure it works. So it's going to be kind of like, hey, let's be available this time. Let's do it and get it done. So looking forward to that.

[38:16] **qx()**: Yeah. Oh, you got your buddy here. Perfect.

[38:22] **Armeanio**: All right, who's next? Aberg.

[38:25] **qx()**: Oh, it's Beene, she's got Sigma Rust. Revealed global deserialized and SS strings PRS by two sec. But yeah, there you go. Aberg all for you. Satergo.

[38:34] **Armeanio**: All right. So with Satergo, the wallet format update is done. What's left is bring it all together. Releasing the Android signer app APK native binaries for Hetzner at API used for ledger. So hit the cat button.

[38:52] **qx()**: Oh yeah. Let's see what else we have. Minotaur.

[39:01] **qx()**: Oh, yeah. Minotaur 2.4.0 released. Minor changes. Display token detail on transaction signing page. Allow multiple token burning on burn token page. Gosh, Joe, it took me like, I'd say two years in crypto before I trusted that burn button in Minotaur. It does, right? I did it on a wallet that just had like junk tokens that I was trying to clean out. So I did it there, got a little more comfortable, reading the transactions, making sure, yep, yep, here's the input, here's the output, missing these, we're getting these tokens back, don't worry, kind of thing, and doing it, but that's funny. Sorry, yeah, what's that?

[39:42] **Armeanio**: I said I had a spam wallet for a little bit where I would just send them and say, okay, it's a miners problem now, right?

[39:49] **qx()**: Yeah, yeah, it is. We'll pick it up in the Sigmanauts pool, right?

[39:54] **Armeanio**: I got a little overwhelmed. So I gave my seed phrase to Rustin.

[40:01] **Armeanio**: Every time people like to be nonsense, it goes to Rustin.

[40:04] **qx()**: So feel like that time you tipped out, I don't know, $1,000 worth of GreasyCex to somebody.

[40:12] **qx()**: I see updated address asset details page to display token icon and ID and name. Display token detail and transaction generate page. Updated transaction box display page to display token ID and icon. Display transaction details. Display all values comma separated. Animated QR code display and scanning. Ooh, fancy. Added transaction display page.

[40:38] **qx()**: I have, oh, this is my cold wallet right here. It's one of these little tiny palms. They were like, I bought it when it was like 80 bucks. But then like six months later, they are like 150. Maybe they're back down now, but it's beautiful. It's run on Android. But man, it chunks along on Minotaur on this little tiny hardware. So it'd be funny to see some sort of animated animation. QR code scan. Interesting.

[41:10] **qx()**: All right. Patch changes. Do not display token with amount equal to zero. Fixed bug in the scanner. Fixed token select order. Updated dependencies. Minotaur icons. And that's the git, I believe. Right there.

[41:28] **Armeanio**: I think that C8's message there is pretty awesome. That I think is a long-term goal for this year going for the layer 1 UX. C8 is championing that right with his Dexter UI He's got a SigmaUSD bank UI that he's doing. That's great, too where if we can deliver people kind of this low layer one user experience where things don't need to be abstracted across

[42:00] **Armeanio**: multiple environments and it is true that mempool chaining and sub-blocks really like take the idea of a stateless or ultra light client that you can, get that type of snappy UX is huge for the ecosystem.

[42:17] **qx()**: I probably you read this. This year we go for number one or shut your website down and don't frustrate people. I think there's

[42:28] **Armeanio**: I think there's an element of truth to that, right? Where, I don't know, that's one of the messy things about crypto is it's like you have to know all of these websites and bounce all over the place, versus having like these, the potential to have micro clients that can just, interact with contracts on chain. even the idea of like a one click install node is huge. versus, where we started, I was what, had to make sure I had all the dependencies and, run a jar.

[43:02] **qx()**: Yep.

[43:03] **Armeanio**: So, we've come a long way, but I think we still have a huge green area in front of us in terms of like the layer one UX. And I do think that, C8 is right. That that's like the optimal outcome.

[43:18] **qx()**: Yeah. All right, we've got PGR four, five, six from signature set. I'll kick in. But with Keystone integration, looking forward to get my hands on a Keystone device. Former mostly done apart from some bug fixing, testing, awaiting review by Keystone team after holidays. Rust SDK done and awaiting review. JavaScript-based SDK done and awaiting review, remaining WebUSB SDK, integration into wallet software, Nautilus, Satergo, et cetera.

[43:52] **qx()**: That's going to be fun. What's it called? I prefer this over... My desk is messy. I lost my ledger key. It's somewhere here, Joe.

[44:07] **qx()**: I prefer this to this, honestly, just UX wise. You know what I mean?

[44:11] **Armeanio**: I have big fingers. I don't like Ledger's little. Oh, gosh. You're like, I've never liked those little fiddly bugs.

[44:18] **qx()**: Every time we do a, every time we do a. a Rosen Bridge for GARD transaction man it's like you're clicking like 30 times boom boom except boom because you have to you have to prove every single box that's across so it's it's fiddly little fucking things I don't like honestly.

[44:44] **Armeanio**: You got Celaut right there with the Celaut project. Writing ideas about the service payment system, implementing a service classification feature for a new demo. Beene, which I'm going to assume is going to be like Italian good. Finalizing the UI fixes for the first version. From there, we'll continue adding improvements for the second version. Awesome.

[45:11] **qx()**: Oh, and let's see. saying we should call and talk about Ergo development and tools. Awesome.

[45:19] **qx()**: All right, we are Mark the Shark. Also, he's been pumping away Mark's been pumping crazy man. He's got his own like shark theming. He's got like no shark eyes boxes like bots going crazy in the channel. It's it's amazing. I'm babysitting the he's on break right now for the weekend. So he asked me to babysit the mining server. So I've been popping in and out of there checking that out.

[45:44] **qx()**: But yeah, so he's got miner rights protocol, token flight, automated system that emits a token to miners with a corresponding rights token, integrated pool and protocol feed to mimic an actual proof of work emission. This could help bring the concept of hard slash sound money to native tokens. IgniFox tokens were distributed to the miners of the pool a month ago or so. But if miners want to participate and don't have this token, reach out and he'll send you one. Note, this is only a prototype. No plans to do anything with these tokens after testing is done.

[46:15] **qx()**: For further testing for the Hashmon project, we will be creating another token to test using NFTs as a rights token. Like we'll be using the NFTs we have already minted. They'll happy to mint another NFT to distribute to current set of miners. Containerizing code bases for automated airdrops based on specific use cases, i.e. bonus tokens and demurrage distribution for Sigmanauts' mining pool. Note MRP is already automated at the time of writing. If you want to check out the code, feel free to do so here. He's got his git there. Note current MRP code is not in the main branch yet.

[46:53] **qx()**: Sigmanauts' mining pool deployed MRP token flight as mentioned above. Miners receiving the token Flame Shards if they hold the IgniFox token and mine to the pool when the pool finds a block. This is fun stuff. The hope is to use this tool to create more revenue for miners outside of ERG itself. Mining pool received 2 million RSV this from disco Solaris team and began distributing these tokens as of this past Monday. Again, mining is an amazing way to token launch. Folks, even if you already launched, it's an amazing way to distribute these kinds of things.

[47:23] **Armeanio**: Especially, especially looking at like, I don't know, pump fun is a great example. No, well, think about it. It's like the largest incentive there is to have supply dominance. You have supply dominance and help something happens versus if you have like proof of work, emission, you can create a contract, admit it through time to where its ability to come to market, and be distributed is. Especially with these these extra tokens, right? Because miners are what miners are paying this they have to pay their bills.

[48:00] **qx()**: That's understood, right? There are miners who speculate too, but if you give a miner enough funds to pay their bill and something extra, they have to pay their bills. They're going to use it as a speculative token to see if it's going to rise in the future. And it's going to be either a slower dump, but it's definitely going to be a slower distribution. And they're actually working for it, too. They're actually converting electricity to secure the chain. It's a great way to do it.

[48:35] **qx()**: Yeah, so the Marp software running on the pool has been causing our disk space to rise quickly and causes some down it caused a few minutes of downtime to the pool reached out to qx() about this and working a fix. He works also mentioned some other solutions which we're exploring as well. I can't remember what I mentioned. I forgot already.

[48:52] **qx()**: Created the NurseShark monitoring bot for pool-related TXs and notifications. I also have integrated it with Anthropic's LLMs, so as to query the LLM for wallet-related activity. Not yet released on Git, looking at integrating an open-source LLM so we don't have to have users pay for their queries. Amazing.

[49:13] **qx()**: Hashmon not to be redundant, but prototyping the MRP token flight with the IgniFox and Flame Shards This tool will be used to distribute our evolution shards for this project, which will be used to evolve monsters. I swear Mark the Shark was like a world-class Dungeon Master in his past right guy seems to have grown up with these several facets and levels of complexity to make these things fun

[49:39] **qx()**: Protocol fields will be collected into the wallet and initially thinking that the first person who collects them all will get the keys to this wallet. Oh, nice. Need to finalize tokenomics with C8. Looking to launch project end of February, beginning of March. Example of using the LLM for my grid trading bot. He's got, what's he got there? Miner, it's protocol token. He's got the shark bot right there.

[50:04] **qx()**: And he continues thresher a reinforcement learning agent project what aims is to trade it to trade on DEXes created a script to scrape the DEX wallet to use as a training data for the RL training environment. Agent environment works as expected, but more work needs to be done and have the agent learn effectively and trade.

[50:23] **qx()**: Some sort of interesting. Agents, actions, buy, sell, hold, rebalance, agent approvations, various buy and sells of ERG and given native token, parallel optimization runs on GPU, so to train agents fast. Again, more works need to be done on the reward environment, likely another month or two work to be done so it can effectively trade. Need to integrate hyper parameter tuning so we can optimize the various parameters We can change like planning rate and real world structure if you haven't noticed mark works with LLM's for his fiat job So this guy's got the chops to do this kind of stuff.

[50:57] **Armeanio**: You could actually do some neat stuff I know he's a he's a python guy and in terms of work so I imagine if he can get some LLM's and build some API's that are getting fed information and build out some more if statements, he could potentially build something pretty cool with trading. I think that's it for the update.

[51:18] **qx()**: Yeah, I think that's all we got.

[51:20] **Armeanio**: I'm going to end with something.

[51:22] **qx()**: Wait, don't end yet. Don't end yet, Joe. Don't end yet. We got, it's been a while since we've done a DevOps, so I think it's fair to remind people that I always try to put Cyberverse into. They've been kicking butt. They jump from average night of 40 users up to about 100. I think that a high watermark in the high hundreds, and now they're averaging 90, 100 users at any given time. They just brought in a new game that's archery. That's really cool. You get one shot with an arrow. The balloons go up. So you have to kind of time it when you're shooting with other people. Really cool mini game.

[51:58] **qx()**: Just keep hitting a pixel and the team here. They just keep kicking out of the park. It's amazing. Another people that keep kicking out of the part are Echo and HQx with MewMart MewFinance the dudes are like writing stuff like they post something that they just wrote I go to bed I come up in the morning and they've done something else like Amazing like fundraising LP buy-ins token launches

[52:25] **qx()**: all that kind of stuff. He's looking into getting Keystone wallets to sell on MewMart as well so you can buy without KYC or giving up your address to some corporate overlords and get spammed for the rest of time. So two projects that are amazing. Hopefully they'll do an update next week to catch us on the dev update. But they are both fantastic. All right, sorry, go for it. What's your ending, Joe?

[52:50] **Armeanio**: My closing message is this. When I was in the when I was in the Ergo Foundation, I had to take like a position of neutrality when it comes to mining pools. Right. Because I had to I had to, ping them and say, hey, we updated or no. Now I no longer have to. So until until Mark's pool is the leading pool in terms of hash rate, if you're mining Ergo, what the fuck are you doing pointing to any other pool?

[53:22] **qx()**: I know it's crazy. You have a chance. You have a chance to be part of a DAO, right? You have a chance to run the damn pool with everybody else. It's like.

[53:33] **Armeanio**: No, I mean, there are people out there that probably just set their rigs, but, really stop this. I'm no longer neutral because I no longer need to be until their hash rate dominant mine to them. Because the other pools are not contributing to the ecosystem in any way. other than they're making their rewards and earning some money. And I guess periodically they'll market something, this or that. But until the active ecosystem is dominant, don't waste your energy feeding it into people that really don't care.

[54:08] **Armeanio**: So miners out there, please consider mining to community pools because they're active and they bring value, they build things for Ergo. They're not just a service. And, the bottom line is we need to put these services in a position where they actually need to do something to compete. So take that as you will.

[54:32] **qx()**: I'm gonna leave it at that Joe. That's a great place to leave it. Some good sound bites for Mark to everybody. It's good to be back with the dev updates, Joe. I appreciate you hopping on the first time back.

[54:45] **Armeanio**: Have a good one.

[54:46] **qx()**: Thanks everybody. Bye bye.
