[00:15] **qx()**: Well, hello there, Mr. Joseph Armeanio.

[00:20] **qx()**: Welcome to the hundred and twenty-first developer update.

[00:27] **Armeanio**: Is it really hundred and twenty-first? Are you serious about that? Are you just making it up?

[00:31] **qx()**: No, I'm really serious. I thought because kushti and I just did the hundred and twentieth a week and a half ago.

[00:40] **Armeanio**: Better man than me. I never counted.

[00:42] **qx()**: Well, I think I'm a little off, but it's close enough like within one or two episodes of each other. That's for sure.

[00:49] **Armeanio**: We'll take it.

[00:51] **qx()**: Yeah. I mean you guys, you and kushti did the heavy lifting all the way up to like episode 80 or 90 or something.

[00:58] **Armeanio**: I used to do these solo so painful. I'd sit in my basement and record it in like 20 pieces and then send 20 pieces to Andy and say, Andy, fix it, please.

[01:09] **qx()**: Poor Andy. Well, we're making up for him with these live shows. He doesn't have to do shit.

[01:16] **qx()**: It all averages out, just like the block time in Ergo.

[01:26] **qx()**: Well, you asked me earlier today what we've got - one viewer at two in the morning here in New York, so that's perfect. Let's see if we get any - welcome. They'll watch it tomorrow. Cheers, I'm drinking some sort of clear liquid. This is iced tea if anybody's asking, yes, very good.

So about five minutes before Joe said that he was ready to jump on, he's like, what's the topic?

[01:54] **qx()**: And I said, topics are for pussies.

[01:58] **qx()**: We're just going to wing it. Like, what's the guy's name? Who's the falafel guy, the loofah guy?

[02:05] **Armeanio**: I have no idea.

[02:06] **qx()**: The Fox news anchor who said, fuck it. We'll do it live.

[02:16] **qx()**: It is Bill O'Reilly. There we go.

[02:23] **qx()**: All right. So why don't we talk briefly about ErgoHack, right? I don't think we've covered that too much. Let me ask you, what project were you most excited about or give me a list of projects that you were.

[02:38] **Armeanio**: It's hard to say. I wasn't a judge this time because well, you know, that's because the results, judged in a week.

[02:47] **Armeanio**: Yeah. There have been complaints that I'm too slow and okay, it's probably valid. But it's also incredibly hard.

[02:56] **qx()**: Oh, it's so difficult.

[02:57] **Armeanio**: Yeah. Because you have, let's say you have something. I don't know. Let's say what mgPai was doing with multisig, right? The ability to take like the barrier of entry in terms of like the difficulty of the user experience and drop that to where most people can use multisig, right? That's huge. That is that's huge. It's that's a huge tool now in terms of the UX experience on Ergo, but that's a massive evolution, right?

And then you have other things that, you know, it's like, okay, well, you could look at what, you know, kushti is doing. I'm not going to vote for kushti. I never would anyway. I don't think he participates to win. But you know you look at like a trustless relay on Ergo and it's like okay well that that's one of these things where you put it in place and the long-term viability and potential of there is huge.

And so it's like, how do you judge the difference between something that could be incredibly impactful into the future and open up new DeFi frameworks and really change the world a little bit, right on Ergo versus something that really is massive in terms of the improvement of security and the user experience in the short term. I don't know how to judge that trade-off. That's why I was a terrible judge.

[04:33] **qx()**: The first time, well, I judged the last ErgoHack. And, you know, I spent meticulous time going through everything, looking at everything. And then I thought I had an idea of what I wanted, and I go to the form that they send us to fill out to judge. And there's comments there about suggestions. And I'm like, I lost it there. I was like, that took me another week or more to fill out at that point. You got to have some insightful comments about why you judged it the way you did, or maybe tips about something. That's extremely difficult after trying to figure out what the hell's going on with all the projects.

[05:11] **Armeanio**: Yeah, yeah, it's I always suffered with the time horizon trade-off. Right. It's like, okay, so this is impactful today. That's incredibly valuable. But then you look at the net potential of something else that, you know, if it does see some love over time could be huge. And how do I make a choice there? I don't know. I'm not a very good judge. I'm just a lover, you know, that's the truth. I was like, oh, that's awesome. That's awesome. That's awesome. How do I pick?

[05:45] **qx()**: Yeah. And all the fricking, I think this ErgoHack VIII, there were a lot of really, really good projects. It was like, you know, atomic swaps on Lightning.

[05:54] **Armeanio**: That's awesome.

[05:56] **qx()**: DuckPools. I mean, goodness gracious.

[05:58] **Armeanio**: Option pools. That was an amazing little thing they put together. So how do I judge that? This time I didn't have to and it was very peaceful. The best ErgoHack ever because I didn't have stress over like, you know, because people listen, they're putting their time, their energy, their thoughts and putting that out and it's like I just kind of want to reward everybody but then it's also a contest and I'm just not a good judge.

[06:28] **qx()**: Well, that's funny when you say that because, Glasgow put up a vote on Paideia to give every team a hundred ERG that entered. So I thought that was great.

[06:40] **Armeanio**: I am going to release some Armeanio prizes, but I'm going to - my plan. Don't tell anyone. Keep it - is to wait until everybody else gets paid. And then I have an idea of like, it changes my logic a little bit. Because I want to reward people who did great work. And then it's like, okay, I can look at, you know, like RosenPort, right? And be like, okay, well, even if they don't win the ErgoHack, I think there's value there that the Rosen team should put up money, right? That's a great tool. We should support them.

[07:22] **qx()**: Yeah, look at RosenPort - look at RosenPort for miners as it is. Just mine right to a RosenPort wallet if you could and just wait and when it reaches a certain threshold the bus goes over and your crypto's have another chain right from mining. So it kind of enhances that mine ability of other stuff. If you mine Ergo, you can move to other places kind of thing. So lots of stuff open for that super cool. So I'm gonna wait and then I'll play cleanup.

[07:53] **Armeanio**: That's the best. That's the best plan. It solves my stress. I've been in a couple ErgoHacks where it's like, okay, well, I don't know how to pick the winner, because they're not necessarily running the same race.

[08:11] **qx()**: No, no, it's crazy. It is. You're like picking. In these cases, it's really - you either have to pick: okay, what's going to be the best for Ergo in the long haul? Or you have to go along the lines of I think this is awesome. And personally, I think this is a better one. So, yeah, you know, when I did it, I had to make a choice. I had to say, okay, am I thinking about: yeah, this is going to further the development of Ergo and adoption and that kind of thing. Or, you know, what are the intricacies of this? And it's just on my level of amazing viewing this or that kind of thing. So, yeah, definitely tough.

And we got, we forced kind of volunteered Rustin to judge it. And I honestly don't think there could have been a better judge. That man takes that stuff seriously. He's looking through stuff, asking through videos.

[08:59] **Armeanio**: No, Rustin's amazing. I love what he's doing with podcasts. I learned I was on Spotify the other day.

[09:10] **qx()**: You can ask Alexa to play the Ergo podcast.

[09:14] **Armeanio**: Yeah. I learned that the other day when I was on Spotify, it's Rustin's work. So cheers to that.

[09:20] **qx()**: Exactly. All right. What else we got? So that was ErgoHack. We've got Ergoversary coming up on July 1st, we got a bunch of guests in the spaces that were hosted on July 1st at 4pm UTC, I believe, which is noon my time, noon Eastern time. What is that? That's 10 o'clock your time. Is that too early, Joe?

[09:42] **Armeanio**: No, I'm up early. I'm with the sun, man. Every day, I'm with the sun.

[09:49] **qx()**: Does the sun rise at nine o'clock over there?

[09:51] **Armeanio**: No, it's usually sooner. Oh, boy. No, I'll be honest. I have a dog that like when nature wakes up, he's up. Like there's stuff outside.

[10:08] **qx()**: I have to drag my dog out of the bed to go pee. So, yeah. Different breeds. That's for sure.

And then we have we're trying to make some videos. I know there's a video that we're trying to put together with at least, you know, half a dozen or ten community members kind of just like an overall general chat about Ergo where it's been where it's from, kind of hear some new faces. And then we'll do a Sigmanauts video kind of where the things are where they came from. And then there's another secret video. I'm hoping to try to think of something and put together - it involves you too Joe. So I think it'll be fun.

[10:45] **Armeanio**: Just paying me. I'll do a Rosen video. Are you doing it too?

[10:51] **qx()**: Are you and MHS or just you or?

[10:54] **Armeanio**: It might just be me. Let's see if I can get if I can rope MHS and do it then it'll be both but Rosen will be delayed another week. Yeah, it's one of those things. But no, I'm really looking forward to that. You know, it's pretty amazing considering where Ergo started and where it is today, I think that's really awesome to see.

[11:23] **qx()**: I've got a topic for you, Joe.

[11:26] **qx()**: Let's see. What about we talk about how Lord of the Flies crypto gets when things start dipping?

[11:37] **Armeanio**: Oh, you're talking about cannibalism. Yeah, you got it. That's always the case.

[11:45] **qx()**: So let's think about why. Why is that the case? Why is that? I mean, we know crypto goes and cycles, you know, and these people are cashing out every single second of the day.

[11:55] **Armeanio**: I would just say that for people, what is money represented in life survival? Right. That's just what it is. And so you have some people that I don't know, I would say may have over-allocated into risk assets. And so when the market is not moving in their direction, it brings up their survival instinct. What happens when people's survival instinct is kicked to a high gear? They get a little animalistic, right? They get a little bitey.

That's just life sometimes, right? I've always tried to say, hey, manage your risks, trade well. You gotta take care of yourself in life. I know that there's a lot of people that come into the crypto space and like the hyper volatility is seductive, right?

[12:56] **qx()**: It is sometimes.

[12:58] **Armeanio**: Yeah. I mean, really it is. So it's like, okay, you have this new thing that drops and everybody looks at the couple of wallets that make out really well. And I guess congratulations, you know, you called red for the wheel spun and ended up there, right? But nobody ever talks about the other money on the table.

And really, sometimes I look at the crypto space, and it's more or less kind of greedy and insane. I was really interested in cryptocurrencies, because it provided really unique assumptions that our current system really fails to deliver, right?

So I've made the joke many times on AMAs that monetary policy reminds me of like electing the pope, where these old fuckers go into some room somewhere and everybody's standing around looking at the chimney to see what color the smoke is. And they're betting on the market like, oh, the feds are going to be dovish today. They're going to be hawkish today. And everybody places their bets and then we sit around and we look at the smoke, right?

But then if you look at kind of the underlying financial management of, well, let's say the United States, I mean, debt has not really localized to the United States, but we have more, what, $35 trillion, $34 trillion. God knows the unfunded liabilities that technically you need to carry $4 trillion.

[14:38] **qx()**: Yep.

[14:40] **Armeanio**: You know, like the financial - I don't know. Long-term assumptions are not good. Every fiat currency goes to zero.

[14:50] **qx()**: Yeah, I saw that comment you had in Baselist today. You were firing away, too.

[14:56] **Armeanio**: Well, I think that sometimes people need to be reminded why the cryptocurrency space started. It had nothing to do with gambling speculation.

[15:07] **qx()**: So how do we do? How do we blend that Joe? How do we stop? You're never gonna stop people from gambling. No, you're never gonna - you're never gonna stop people from - so I'm sitting there catching up to your 240 messages in Baselist because kushti started off I think and then you jumped in afterwards. But I'm sitting there thinking like how do we get people - like I don't - here's an example like I remember I was talking to my brother about something. And he was talking about how he can't understand how people can't see people's views from other sides. And I was like, well, you know, I tried to have a conversation about something, but I can't remember how it went.

So a couple, like literally an hour later, there was like, we were drinking something, like we were eating dinner and he grabbed some soy milk sets, drinking it. And he's like, oh, you got to try this soy milk. It's delicious. I was like, I tried it. I'm not a fan of, he's like, how do you not like soy milk? Like how do you not like it? It's the most delicious thing in the world. I was like, dude, you're just like negating your point from two hours ago. Like you said, you know that kind of thing.

So that brings me to think how do we - how do we sit in a Baselist and reading it, you know, I thought to myself, you know, I feel like I'm totally into crypto for a different reason than these people talking our inputs. So yeah, how do we merge those kind of things or how do we leverage or live in harmony and peace there?

[16:36] **Armeanio**: I think you have different time horizons. That's just the simplest way I can put it. You have different incentives and different time horizons. I would say you have some people in the crypto space, and this is not just Ergo, but you have some people that they dedicate their life to saying, okay, well, you know, you can look at privacy. You can look at properties of money. You look at like this idea of creating an open digital economy over the internet. And they're kind of in for the long term, right, because they look at, you know, potential, you know, fiat crises, central bank digital currencies, and ever-encroaching monitoring state that allows users to have very little privacy when it comes to their money or their personal life. And they say, hey, that's not the world I want to live in. Right.

And so I would say there's some mind-share that is really thinking 10 years in advance, 20 years in advance, 30 years in advance, what's the world going to look like? And how can we try to build technologies that shape at, you know, worst case some counter economy that we can participate in on some level.

[17:53] **qx()**: Yeah.

[17:53] **Armeanio**: And avoid systems that are just digital prisons. Right. And then you also have traders who are watching the five-minute chart and they're saying, hey, this is going up. This is going down. This is going around, you have a bunch of, you know, sometimes more, I'm just gonna say more or less insane influencers in the space that - we got to say call them promoters Joe, what they are, they're not influenced, they're promoters.

[18:25] **qx()**: Yeah, basically, they have no general, they have no unique thoughts of their own, man, they're not influences that influence anything, they're literally promoting something. Because it's they're promoting on original thoughts.

[18:36] **Armeanio**: So no, usually, more or less, what happens is they take a position and then they market it. Right. And they say, come to me. And, you know, it's like the let's create a narrative. Let's try to extract capital from that narrative, or they get paid to take a position. Yeah, or they get paid because they've built clout or hype or whatever.

There's a totally different time horizon there. There are people in crypto that they're scanning. They're plugged into Twitter and they're like, oh my God, look at this meme coin. Maybe that's going to do it. And they're constantly trying to make moves. And so that's a very different mentality than saying, okay, well, what's the future going to look like in 10 years and how do we shape it?

Like, I don't think those are ever going to be fully compatible, to be honest, because whenever you're talking like those differences in time horizons, there's just a different mentality. Right.

[19:40] **qx()**: Well, I mean, right. At some point, this system that we're developing, it's going to be quite a bit less volatile than it is now. Right. At some point, it's got to be.

[19:49] **Armeanio**: Well, I mean, you look at Ergo itself, a part of the monetary inflation that it's going through, it was quite rapid. It was intense. If you look at the distribution curve of Ergo, which we're still stepping down, but yeah, I mean, that's had some very unique monetary policy.

A big part of that was to move towards this idea of a demurrage-based security mechanism where all of the value on Ergo is potentially available to the miners and there's a certain incentive to stay active and secure it. You know, that's a new experiment in the cryptocurrency space. I think there's a lot of value in that. It creates a lot of really unique long-term properties that are beneficial.

But again, you go to time horizons, right? And sometimes, I don't know, sometimes like the marketing time horizon is now. Like you want to capture everybody's attention now for 15 seconds and sell them. And then you have other people that are like sitting back and trying to think deep and like, okay, well, what can we build that, you know, if we can build gold-backed stable coins, right? And you have all of these dealers all across the planet, which are more, it's more or less like its own peer-to-peer network physically, like there's a ton of shops that will buy and sell gold.

If we could build a product that's digital and it's stable enough, could we potentially create an open network where any of these dealers could potentially charge their own premium and settle physically? How cool would that be? Then, you know, it's like we've fulfilled eGold, the digital currency from like 1996. On Ergo, that would be cool as hell.

But that's something with a long term time horizon, because it takes a lot of tools. And then, you know, you need to take the idea and it needs to prove itself over time to where some people are willing to take the risk to actually step in and say, okay, there's profit margin on that premium. And, you know, maybe there's some flexibility there in terms of settlement where you could expand the profit margin a little bit because it's crypto based. But that's not going to happen overnight. That's not a 15-second marketing pitch, right? That's something that's going to take solid infrastructure and good engineering, and then it's going to need to survive volatile markets. And, you know, it's a journey in and of itself.

But if you look at the long-term potential, you know, could we potentially create that in five years, 10 years, three years? Sure, potentially. But, you know, if you're looking at the five-minute chart, what does that have to do with the price of tea in China, right?

And then you get into like, oh, you know, this person that's more or less popular made a tweet. Right. So people there's totally different time horizons that I don't think are so compatible.

[22:53] **qx()**: Well, I mean, look at today. I had to jump off Twitter today because it just didn't upset me. But I was like, what the fuck? Stuff's going around like, oh, Cardano's the next Solana for meme season. I'm like, oh my fucking God. And then I see a token of a pig have over a million, like in the first day, a million market cap.

[23:16] **Armeanio**: You know, when it comes to that short-term stuff, I just say it's crypto, baby. I've been, you know, you could go back to like ETH, and the ICO season, 2017, everybody's hot, everybody's selling all kinds of random shit that probably doesn't even make sense. But in the short-term horizon, everything was hot, right? And so everybody's super excited. But if you actually look at like what turned over and what delivered, you know, suddenly, it's very small, right? You know, and that's one thing, like, in a way, it really bothered me about the crypto industry.

This is its own little side tangent, but fuck it, I'm live, I'll talk about it. You know, one of the best product market fits for crypto itself has been stable coins, right? And if we look at what's rolling out in Europe and probably in the United States and other jurisdictions eventually, like they're taking all of the best qualities of like potential stable coin use and just murdering them. Right. So, you know, you can say freezing ability, reporting, like suddenly you're taking - I'm not - you can read Baselist anyway but I'm not the biggest fan of fiat stable coins and there's decent reasons in my opinion.

A big part of it is it's a huge attack vector in terms of regulation because, well, you're essentially counterfeiting money. There's no other way to put it. You can say, okay, well, it's backed by a treasury. And so we've created a digital representation. But if I as a citizen said, okay, I own bonds, and so I'm going to make Joe Bucks and I'm going to sell Joe Bucks on the street, right, there would probably be a problem with that. But, you know, we're doing it online. And so there's less of a problem, I guess.

You know, it opens up just huge legal questions in terms of like, you know, what does compliance look like? And so I think that having something like gold or silver-backed stable coins is more valuable because you already have networks that are trading those assets that are more or less decentralized and distributed across the planet and pretty much available in every jurisdiction.

And if we can create some profit margin for them to extend their business, that makes sense. And you avoid a lot of the potential problems that you could run into with fiat pegs. But I really think that's one of the most valuable product market fits that crypto has found because most people globally do not want volatility, right?

A lot of the meme coin traders and things like that, they have enough stability in their life that they can gamble. But if you're somebody that, you know, you're in an economy that has massive inflation and you wake up and the value of your money has changed, having access to something that's more stable is incredibly valuable because people in that situation, they want their money to just preserve power from when they're in the back of the bread line to the front.

[26:58] **qx()**: I don't have much crypto to spare for this kind of thing. And I was like, oh, you can test it out with like 20 or 30 ERG. And he was like, yeah, exactly. I don't have 20 or 30 ERG to spare for this. And, you know, it's just brings you back to the realization, you know, that there's a lot we're doing and why we're doing it.

[27:17] **Armeanio**: Yeah. There's a lot of people that represent the crypto market that are first-worlders that are well off, that are just fucking around for fun. Right. And then you have a whole different subset of humanity. And then that's, you know, the part of why we've said, okay, well having like low barrier of entry and the best security assumptions are important. You know, we'd love the NIPoPoWs ultra light node wallet, right? That you can run on basically any device.

[27:51] **qx()**: How are these fuckers supposed to do a transaction on ETH when, you know, a couple ERG - I don't mean to say fuckers, I mean fuckers in a good way. How are these guys supposed to do a TX on ETH when it's like, you know, it could be five, ten bucks a fucking TX? You know, that's like that's how could be out there bag for shit sake for the week. You know, it's like, no, there's a usability of this shit. What are these systems? What are they even propped up for? It's fucking crazy.

[28:14] **Armeanio**: One thing I did like about ETH for a while. Right. And this is another thing that - this isn't therapy, Joe.

[28:20] **qx()**: You don't have to say a good thing after we say a bad thing.

[28:23] **Armeanio**: No, I have to. I have to say a good thing here because it's something I'd like to recreate. All right. Let's hear it.

I think one of the most valuable things about ETH when it was a proof-of-work network is when mining was profitable, you had people all around the world. Even if they had one GPU. Right. You know, they could earn a couple bucks a month and a couple bucks a month in some places goes a long way. Like it was legitimately putting food on people's tables. You know, keeping somebody's lights on somewhere.

[28:57] **qx()**: Yeah, I mean, for those people like in the US or Canada or, you know, something like that, think of - think of a country like Italy, where you're thinking you're mad. Yeah, it's Italy. That's a touristy country. It's a lot of wealthy people there. You know, the average salary, I think, from what I understand from the people that we work with over for Cornell, it's like 1300 bucks a month.

[29:22] **Armeanio**: And that's a developed country.

[29:24] **qx()**: Yeah, that's a fucking developed country. You can only imagine what it's like elsewhere. So yeah.

[29:29] **Armeanio**: And also, so I have to say, like, nobody, you know, everybody was talking about this green stuff. And, you know, ETH is now more centralized because it's greener. But the amount of people globally that they rugged when mining was profitable was terrible. That like I, I will stand by the statement like long term. I think that was a dumb decision. I know staking is sexy and you can do nothing and you can potentially earn rewards. And now you have re-staking, which is the newest sex machine over there. But, you know, in terms of having electricity input and computational power to profit, that's hugely valuable long term.

So that was one of my favorite things. I think that, you know, the hardware wall that they had and kind of the first mover adoption they had was amazing. And that's one of the reasons why you'll see me every once in a while on Twitter or on socials trying to give a shit to the industry as a whole. Like consumer-grade hardware proof-of-work can feed people. Like that's huge. If you actually care about like decentralized networks and growing those energy inputs and creating value globally, that's massive. Anybody around the world with a basic computer, GPU can, or CPU in some cases even can, you know, hop on and earn a little bit extra. That's real value that's being distributed globally. That's the kind of shit that I want to see in crypto. You're talking about the newest animal coin. I don't give a single fuck.

[31:20] **qx()**: You know, every time I think about mining and the future of mining and that kind of thing. I can't help but think of - and I think I said that's like 30 times so people can fuck off if they've heard it already - but it reminds me I like those futuristic things like you have this guy out and look in the desert farming moisture and he's got all this high-tech equipment and he's selling that kind of thing and that's how he makes a living. Same thing I think for fucking mining, you know, you can do this stuff with just rigs you can put together yourself with your own hands and then utilize the electricity that's coming in or even make your own electricity from other devices that you have from natural sources. There's some really cool solar miners out there and I think it's gonna be sexy again.

[31:59] **Armeanio**: That's my long-term thesis I guess is that if you look at all of this AI infrastructure and all of the computation that's not gonna slow down right and where proof of work is usually the most efficient is when it comes to repurposing excess. Right. So you can look at Bitcoin. You know, it seems as though - my opinion anyway, it seems as though like ASIC mining long term is probably going to get eaten by power companies because they have the lowest input cost and they can load balance their own resources.

[32:36] **qx()**: Yeah. In which case, keep the plant cranked all night when it's low use, then spin up the ASICs.

[32:43] **Armeanio**: It's going to be, I think it's going to be harder over time for like consumers to compete with that, right? You know, especially, you know, post-halving mining's probably been pretty painful for a lot of miners. One thing that's kind of unique with consumer grade is the barrier of entry is lower, right? And so I would say most people, you know, if you look at kind of the distribution of proof-of-work assets can mine something. Right. And then it's a matter of saying, okay, well, you know, what can they do with it? And that's kind of a big open question that I really would like to see five years from now.

I would like to see Sigmanauts ported to multiple different energy input. You know, let's say CPU, GPU, different algorithms. You know, we passed the four gigabyte cards and so we rolled over. And so a certain amount of GPUs are no longer available in that. It's understandable. We got to kind of escape.

[33:50] **qx()**: We got to harden.

[33:51] **Armeanio**: Yeah, we got to harden over time. But, you know, it would be nice to have some mechanism where people could mine to Sigmanauts and potentially even Ergo, right? Because we can create some really unique constellations of proof-of-work and try to give people more access to financial tools.

[34:15] **qx()**: Yeah, yeah, go for it.

[34:15] **Armeanio**: The truth is that time horizon problem will never be solved. Because, you know, it's just different visions, right? Like you have people that are legitimately here trying to like, they look into the future, they don't like what they see, they're trying to change that.

[34:33] **qx()**: Well, I mean there's even even on fiat there's a huge I guess market for trading currencies right and hedging the bets between the differences value between currencies so one currency goes down you swap into the other you buy it after it's up kind of thing.

[34:52] **Armeanio**: Yeah, there's forex. That's there. You know there's huge leverage in forex because you have your own weird game where you have a lot of liquidity depth, you have central banks that can intervene, you have all kinds of, you know, random factors that can be thrown in.

But I tend to align to a certain degree with like the old fashioned Bitcoin philosophy that if you change the money, you change the world, right? Where the ability to control not only the creation but the distribution of money just is something that people suck at managing. It usually leads to insane choices.

One thing I was tweeting a while ago is California spent X billion for a couple meters of railroad track that doesn't have a fucking train. Like who manages this insanity? And, you know, you look at just the budget size relative to like the delivery of value. Something is fucked. No other way I can put it.

So, you know, that's why I'm here. Because I think, to a certain degree, governments can't be responsible for the creation and distribution of money without manipulating it and abusing it. And so having some alternative system that has better assumptions in terms of monetary policy, in terms of how the system actually functions, is better for humanity net-net. And that's a long-term vision. That's not going to happen in five minutes if somebody's looking at trade.

So we always kind of have to balance that. You know, if you look at like that long-term vision, if the space as a whole is able to achieve that, it's a huge success. You know, and that's a different metric for success than like the five-minute moon.

[36:56] **qx()**: Yeah. I mean, that's not going to be easy, right? People, people who hold power do not want to give up power.

[37:02] **Armeanio**: I mean, no, there's a lot of, you know, there's a lot of crazy regulations that are coming into play, whether it's stable coins. Even in the US you know, you say, okay, the 501(c)(6), the blockchain association is not aligned with crypto values. In my opinion, you know, you look at a lot of the people that kind of champion or parrot on the space. You know, in terms of like regulatory adoption, you look at their previous calls, you know, they've had terrible track records in terms of what they promote and what they do. But, you know, I don't know. Sometimes the crypto space is most popular voices or just ambulance chasers. There's no other way to put it. They like try to run in front of the narrative and say, oh, look at me, I'm important.

I'm not important, I just want to create some open source tools that help people. That would be like the best long term goal is that at some point I can just fade off and, you know, pass the torch to new people who build cool stuff and have first principles in mind. Say, okay, how do we build like new forms of money? And how do we create distributed systems where people have clear assumptions in terms of how they work and how they can manage risk. And we have like these digital assets that transcend borders and are able to have some form of like local settlement to where, you know, let's say gold, silver, if we could create that, then who cares what the base fiat currency is because it's relatively convertible universally.

So those are the kinds of things that I think about. Not the five-minute chart, I can't.

[38:50] **qx()**: Well, I'm glad you're young. I'm glad you're young, Joe. You'll probably see it through in your lifetime. So that's great.

[38:55] **Armeanio**: Yeah, it's a goal of mine to stick around and make that happen.

[39:02] **qx()**: You know, it's not - well, it is often, you know, people go through changing their minds, you know, these some of these influences that I've promoters that I've interviewed on the Dev Update. You know, a lot of their takeaway or a lot of their main point is that you bring in the people that are chasing airdrops, meme tokens, meme coins, meme projects, that kind of stuff. And that's how you bring in the adopters and you know, on face value, I get it. You know, you bring those people in. Yes, they come in. But the deeper you think about this is, you bring them in that's there's no substance there you bring them in and yeah your space gets bigger. And then it gets bigger with more people similar to that. I don't think it's - it doesn't have that same kind of ideals at least that what Ergo is promoting and what's in the manifesto? And for the long-term thing there so - sorry go for it.

[40:06] **Armeanio**: More often than not, you know, that type of thing is a PVP situation. Right.

[40:12] **qx()**: Yeah.

[40:13] **Armeanio**: Like, I'll use an example. I gave some shit to Kraken the exchange and some people sent me some private complaints like, hey, stop.

[40:20] **qx()**: Oh, you mean the Airgun?

[40:23] **Armeanio**: That's just that happens. Oh, Jesus.

[40:25] **qx()**: Yeah. Every fucking week. You forgot that you forgot to ask the person what the Twitter account was at the end of the series. Or, you know, you should tone it down a little bit.

[40:36] **Armeanio**: Well, I mean, if you really if you really step back and you think about it and it's like, okay, so promote Biden and Trump coin, okay? In two election cycles, who's going to care? Nobody, nobody. I mean, to two election cycles ago, who is running for the vice president of the losing party? Nobody cares. Somebody out there knows, but the majority of the people, they don't give a shit. Right. And so it, to some degree, like I think the principles that major parties in this industry promote are just the wrong thing. Why wouldn't you, we talk about like, hey, what is the benefit of decentralized money?

[41:22] **qx()**: And we know the answer, Joe, we know the answer is money.

[41:27] **Armeanio**: I know. It comes down to time horizon. Yeah, it comes down to time horizons. Their time horizon is we want to integrate an asset that is popular right now and gives us high fees. And if our users get fucked, we don't care.

[41:42] **qx()**: Nope. No fucking give a shit.

[41:44] **Armeanio**: Yeah. So, you know, you even have these big places like Coinbase who preach the opposite to, you know, we're more regulated. We don't do this. Then they come out with Base and fucking Brett is like this. What is Brett like number seven now? It's going to topple some other meme tokens out there. It's like, what the fuck?

[42:01] **Armeanio**: I don't know. I don't really watch it. But, you know, that's what I'm saying. I think that the time horizons and the incentives are a little screwed up sometimes. So like for me, why am I here? This is long-term time horizon. That's what I care about. That's what interests me. Right. You know, and yeah, things are messy. It's, you always have a certain like organizational friction with actual decentralization where it's not, you know, one company or one party that's really fucking everything. But that's part of the beauty of it too. You know, and then so a lot of the times I just sit back and I watch the space and it's entertaining.

[42:52] **qx()**: But I agree, I agree. I think those kind of things give more room for unique and special enclaves of like-minded individuals. And in the current systems, you know, it's either you're this or you're not. And these systems that we're promoting here in Ergo and other proof-of-work or decentralized or peer-to-peer networks, you get these enclaves of unique voices that can express themselves and do what they need to do without being, you know, without having to conform to.

[43:22] **Armeanio**: There's definitely some crypto events and, you know, side events and community stuff. There's definitely like a unique social organization. I like that. That is entertaining. It is. But I don't know, I tend to think like, okay, 10 years from now, you know, what can we do? That needs to be kind of like the long-term goal.

And maybe sometimes, you know, even in Ergo, you know, I think we get some complaints sometimes like, hey, you guys aren't paying attention to five minutes, 10 minutes a day a week, you're thinking way too far ahead and nobody understands what you're thinking. And then that's something we could definitely probably improve in terms of -

[44:12] **qx()**: Well, you know Joe when I was taught to drive my stepfather - you know, I sat behind the wheel. I was driving my stepfather says qx() you're focusing too close in front of you on the road and you're looking at every single curve ahead of you very closely and you're turning the wheel right every five feet, you know, you're so you're jerking the car on. He says stop, look at the horizon, look at the far part of the road, focus on that and drive to that. Instantaneously, it made a huge difference. And I think that's very relevant into where we are today on our discussion. You know, quit fucking looking at this, you know, oh, this token went down 10%, fuck, you know, I'm gonna sell everything, I'm gonna buy everything, sell it as soon as it goes up and my life's over. Fuck, you know.

[44:53] **Armeanio**: It depends what people's initial intent was right like I don't think you can really - I don't think you can - we can change you don't think we can - you know I think people are you know they have their own incentive their own reasons, and that's okay, right? That's okay to me, but simply because that exists doesn't mean that you know I'm gonna change my long-term goals right.

I don't know if you've been in the crypto industry for a while and you really kind of look at history. There are things that burned hot for three months, six months, and things just rotate all crazy.

[45:33] **qx()**: I don't think I can name a meme token from the last bull cycle besides Doge maybe. That's it.

[45:38] **Armeanio**: Yeah, like Shiba.

[45:40] **qx()**: Oh, Jesus, I forgot about that shit. Yeah. Like there were 30 different variants of Shiba.

[45:46] **Armeanio**: Now there's so many dogs that it's, you know, it's like a wild street pack. Right. I don't know what's happening. That can't pay attention. And then you have the dogs versus cats versus the other animals first. Like that's its own rabbit hole that I'm sure that if you dive into, there is no bottom. But to me, that's just a sink that I don't want to waste my energy on.

Well, you think that people would sit back and think for a second and say, okay, well, it's hard when it's hard when, you know, there are quote-unquote winners. Right. Yeah. Look at this. Look at this person. They bought, you know, dog with hat in the first five minutes. And now they have all of this money.

[46:30] **qx()**: And I mean, the money comes from somewhere, Joe.

[46:32] **Armeanio**: It fucking comes from everything you ever wanted. But that's that's sexy for a lot of people. And that's how broken money is. Right. That in a way, that's how broken money is that people, you know, go to that extreme, you know, trying to make their dreams work.

[46:52] **qx()**: You know, my neighbors used to call the lottery, the stupid tax, essentially. And I feel like this is similar except, you know, the government's not getting the money. Just somebody with a fancy YouTube channel that's steered you in that direction.

[47:06] **qx()**: Well, in the end, I guess, Joey, you're right. I'll drink to that.

[47:13] **Armeanio**: They always get their cut. Come on.

[47:16] **qx()**: Well, I don't know. We do have a mixer, Joe.

[47:21] **Armeanio**: Well, there go.

[47:21] **qx()**: That's right. That's right. Optional privacy when you need it.

[47:25] **Armeanio**: But like that, I don't know that mentality. To me, it kind of bothers me, right? Because I don't want to honeypot people. That's and there's a lot of honeypotting. Right? There's a lot of sticky in this space where people are just they're trying to honeypot like, hey, you know, come and buy this and, you know, it'll give you your dreams or whatever.

But I tend to try to think, you know, like, okay, five years, 10 years, what can we do? Like if we could actually create stable coins that are backed by commodities and we create settlement and premium and allow people to transfer relatively seamlessly in and out of the digital asset space into kind of their own local economy through some distributed network of dealers, that would be cool as hell. I would be like that. That's the kind of thing that gets me excited because I could see that as more useful long term, right?

[48:25] **qx()**: How do we do it, Joe?

[48:27] **Armeanio**: Well, first thing we have to do is we have to create the right framework.

[48:31] **qx()**: You know, we've got I mean, we're on our way, right?

[48:34] **Armeanio**: Yeah. Yeah, we're on our way. We're working towards that. But if you look at the five-minute chart, it's not going to happen. It's just not going to happen. And then it's like, okay, well, if we could create these gold silver coins or gold stable coins, why not silver? Right. Why not try to distribute it across a couple of assets that people have some access to?

We can look at stable coins in general where war breaks out somewhere and somebody leaves a jurisdiction and they can actually transfer their wealth with them. Suddenly you've just made the potential for precious metals to be weightless. How cool is that?

[49:16] **qx()**: Yeah, I mean, what about stable coins based on based on the chief exports of a certain region? You know, what if what if a region sells or creates alpaca fur and that's like their entire economy where they're only creating this kind of certain export? I mean, it'd be interesting to put stables against something like that, too. I mean, it's limitless, right? You can fuck it.

[49:36] **Armeanio**: One of the more interesting things about digital assets is this ability to create liquidity. And then it's just a matter of saying, okay, well, is that liquidity tied to anything that has this ability to transfer into reality or is it more, just financial games? And there's a lot of financial games in crypto that I don't see as incredibly valuable for most people.

That's a kind of crazy metric to me anyway. But I don't know, I can't I hate to say it, but I'm fucking old when it comes to this space now where like, you know, way back when even the idea of pre-mining was like, oh, that's. That's pretty toxic. Why would you want to create that type of monetary policy where you have seigniorage where your ability to produce assets is different than, you know, the energy to create them. You never hear things like that anymore. Now it's like, look at this. It's the next flashy thing and five years. I don't know if it has any staying power or value. Social energy backing things is not so sustainable, right?

I think a lot of people will look back at their trades in five years and be like, oh my God, it was jnco jeans from the nineties. Like it was fashionable for whatever time and people.

[51:31] **qx()**: I sure fucking hope so, Joe.

[51:34] **Armeanio**: You know, I honestly think that's kind of going to be the case where a lot of people in five years, if they really look back at their decisions, they're like, oof, you know, didn't necessarily make sense. That was embarrassing. And I hope, you know, people really look at like Bitcoin did a magical thing where you had this ability to kind of be your own bank, right. And so my hope is that long term, we can extend that to where, you know, you just give new tools and new possibilities for people to run their own financial life locally.

[52:12] **qx()**: I would say one of the issues is to that these people that are doing this that are sinking 50 million dollars a day from retail. These are people that most of them I would say I think it's safe to say most of them are too fucking comfortable. It's the same issue of why people don't go and vote for president. You're too fucking comfortable. You got a nice TV. You got some beer in the fridge. You probably got a pool out back. Maybe a good car in the driveway, you know, bucket. You don't want anybody to take that from you. You know, you're comfortable.

[52:58] **Armeanio**: You know, ease monetary policy and then liquidity is going to flow into risk assets.

[53:03] **qx()**: And it's like a bunch of people on their knees just waiting for whatever shot out of the Fed's mouth for the - it's wild.

[53:09] **Armeanio**: You know, it's really wild to look at it historically. Like we went from, you know, a counter movement to central banks to where now most of the stable coins hold treasuries and subsidized central banks. Like there's a weird full circle in effect that just is what it is.

You know, I can say that probably the debate in terms of principles is just as divisive as different time horizons. Where if I say, okay, well, you know, we should advocate for privacy to everybody and try to deliver that in an open source way with clear assumptions. And, you know, I've had people actually message me and say, hey, can you delete the mixer. You know, we don't like the look of that. And it's like, well, this is open source software that I don't control.

[54:07] **qx()**: Yeah, you're like, what do you want me to do?

[54:07] **Armeanio**: But that's where their mind is at is that, hey, this is not acceptable. And we want the government to come and bless the network.

[54:15] **qx()**: So I mean, that's the whole point. This whole point is you shouldn't have to have the government come and bless the network. I mean.

[54:21] **Armeanio**: Well, it's splitting. Like long term, I don't think that governments are going to be super friendly to the idea that a distributed group of people can create value without them being in the middle. And so what do we see? What do we see is governments continually regulating and pushing to be in the middle? Right. Hey, let's add some KYC, you know, and let's add some surveillance technology. Let's add, you know, who knows how regulations are going to shift. Right.

[54:57] **qx()**: Let's partner with Snickerdoodle so we can keep tabs on everybody's wallet.

[55:02] **Armeanio**: Yeah. And, you know, there's a lot of people that are like, hey, that's great because it's going to lead to more adoption. And then it's like, well, I don't see the value versus PayPal at that point, to be honest. I really don't. And inevitably, we're probably going to see central bank digital currencies.

[55:24] **qx()**: Oh, yeah. And at that point, Joe, it's going to be no fucking different than the other leaders in the spaces. And I think at that point, Ergo is going to shine and it's going to be painfully obvious to other people why Ergo is what it is and what we've been working towards, hopefully.

[55:40] **Armeanio**: Hopefully, I mean, it's hard to say it's it's one of these things where if you look at the net potential of a lot of stable coins in EVM, they basically have the potential to be central bank digital currencies in my opinion, where it's like you have freezable assets that can constantly be traced and tracked and like that that's, you know, it's popular and it's like, well, if it's regulatory compliant, then that's a good thing. And, you know, then more, you know, liquidity could flow into the system.

And so I really think there's gonna be a break at some point with first principles, you know, to where it's like long-term, the ability to be an actual unstoppable network that offers some counter economic value. That's my long-term goal. Like that's my thesis. I don't think that if you look at like, oh, we're going to trade, you know, major stock markets on this decentralized exchange, et cetera, et cetera, you're not going to be able to move into that space and keep first principles. It's just not compatible. Like, okay, you can kind of be co-opted by an old system, but you're not actually going to deliver solid assumptions to everybody globally.

And so I've said for a long time, my goal is to build for war. Because inevitably, I think that's how the space is going to break down, is you have projects, people that say, okay, well, if we're compliant, you know, then we're going to be temporarily blessed, but any real long-term benefits globally are dead. In my opinion. You know, I don't see the difference between PayPal and, you know, stable coin that sends on a network that's regulatory compliant because they're going to access the same user base. Right. Part of the goal of cryptocurrency was to create neutral and open platforms like the internet itself.

[58:02] **qx()**: I think that sometimes people see that as a turn off about the way people act and the way people talk about Ergo. These other projects that you're talking about, exactly, the amount of principles that they will give up to be included because they're afraid of failing and losing control of what they have. Compared to what we have it's more of a fuck you you know this is what's here. This is what's built. Go ahead try to stop at somebody else will pop something up and go. Kind of thing so that that's that's scary to people you know that kind of - I think on one level if let's say that five years from now you know you have a bunch of regular networks right in my opinion. They're kind of all the same. Exactly the digital fiat man. That's fucking it.

[58:43] **Armeanio**: They're they're kind of going to all be the same.

[58:45] **qx()**: So might as well be fully government backed digital fiat.

[58:49] **Armeanio**: At that point, I don't see the value. Yeah, like I really do believe the value of cryptocurrency is going to be who can survive. You know, and in Bitcoin actually did a really good job leading the way where how many times was Bitcoin attacked or banned in different jurisdictions and it's still around, right? I think that survivability is why Bitcoin is king, because it's died hundreds of times. You know, you can say, okay, Mt. Gox gets attacked and, you know, the value goes from what, $15 to a penny and just all kinds of madness that it's been through and still, you know, tick tock next block, right?

So, you know, I really think that should be the net goal of open systems is to try to be resilient rather than compliant. Now, that's not popular for a lot of the B.C. space. That's not a popular for a lot of the political, let's say, aligned side of the space because, you know, they're going to immediately say like, hey, bad things can happen if you have a fucking argument.

[60:05] **qx()**: Yeah.

[60:07] **Armeanio**: It's the value of like neutral money.

[60:09] **qx()**: Yeah, exactly.

[60:11] **Armeanio**: You have to be able to enable things that you don't necessarily agree with or like in order for it to really be, I don't know, let's say free. Yep. So that's why I'm here. That's why I'm around.

[60:26] **qx()**: I mean, tell me, what do you think? What's the value in a system? You know, let's say these systems become fully compliant. And, you know, essentially, their digital fiat, all these and there's no real difference between the two except for some are run on $600 nodes per month and others are maybe run on a little bit more meager nodes that are more affordable and maybe a little more decentralized, but they're all regulatory compliant. They're all stamped and sealed and they're going to think what's the difference? Why use that instead of fucking visa? What the fuck's the point?

[61:01] **Armeanio**: We get into like the core split. Okay. And we already see this a lot where like from my perspective, like the most important thing about cryptocurrencies is the fairness of money itself. Right. And a lot of what is sold to the general public is about the kind of like the financial system or the financial network or the financial technology of the system rather than the money itself. Hey, we have all of these TPS is we have all of this throughput. We have this ability to scale. But then you look at how money itself was created and distributed and is admitted is broken like I don't know.

I think to some degree, that's one of the reasons why. I love proof of work. I'm not gonna sit here and talk shit about proof of stake. I think it's more social money and you can look at what Cardano's doing with governance and that's crazy complicated and then you get into politics and human nature and all the shitty side of the political sphere of social interaction, I guess.

But proof of work as energy input money has always fascinated me because, you know, excess cheap energy is a limited resource, right? Like if I move into a jurisdiction that has cheap energy and I start using a lot of it, they're going to raise their price. Why wouldn't they? Because demand is there. So like, you know, if you look at hydropower or solar power or whatever, it's always a limited resource that proof of work is going to be chasing. You know, whether it's on the energy side or the computational side.

[62:52] **qx()**: Yeah.

[62:52] **Armeanio**: You know, so it reminds me more of like a commodity-based money where, you know, it's kind of distributed globally and players are going to try to leverage whatever, you know, resources are in their environment to maximize their profit potential. That fascinates me because that's why I like crypto, you know, from day one was proof of work, you know, proof of stake in the social side.

That's - there's a lot of complexity. There's a lot of politics. There's a lot of drama. There's a lot of things that are really interesting because I mean, to some degree, governance in and of itself is always like a social animal.

[63:29] **qx()**: But I mean, the original monetary system was based on proof of work you're fucking you know well at least in the in early centuries right you're you're fucking digging shit out of a hill and unbearing it and washing it off. You're you're fucking it's proof of work literally.

[63:51] **Armeanio**: Yeah, but I mean, I mean there's a social aspect to money you always have to you always have to. You know, so I'm not against it. I've never said, hey, there's some hardcore Bitcoiners that are like, hey, let's, you know, it's a scam and let's ban it. Why not? It's P2P money still. It's just a different assumption in terms of like the net input is like we're going to build some social layer and get people to adopt it. But to me, commodity money has always made more sense because, well, energy and computation are something that kind of transcend fiat, right? Yeah, right. They're useful beyond just like a value exchange. You know, they're their own type of commodity that more or less is going to determine the future of humanity. How much energy region produce and you know how much computational power do they have?

[64:46] **qx()**: Yeah, we got a comment from somebody from Lewis. He says I'm an immigrant on a visa type permit in case something happened to where the government wanted to kick me out I would be okay because I use these systems as in crypto as a hedge against the government super super cool.

[65:01] **Armeanio**: Yeah, I mean, there's there's real value there in terms of being autonomous from one particular system. You know, and, you know, that's a good example is, you know, like remittance and cross-border payments and even somebody that's in a jurisdiction that, you know, their actual status is more or less sketchy. Their ability to hold their value wherever they go is hugely important, in my opinion.

[65:31] **qx()**: Imagine traversing borders. How are you going to carry your value with you? Crypto is welcome perfectly for that.

[65:39] **Armeanio**: Yeah, I've said stable coins had a huge product market fit. And that's really been one of the cool innovations of crypto. But if I look at the regulatory side and, you know, kind of what's coming out of the EU, like most of the first principles benefits are gone. And so I say, okay, well, that's like a major step backwards.

From my perspective, now, I'm sure there's people out there in the crypto space that are like, oh, this is great, because the government, you know, approve of us the number we're going to be able to move money. Yeah. Yeah. You know, our 401ks are going to ability to access that type of liquidity. But usually those people are more or less. Okay. Right. Like if you actually have the type of savings where you can build a 401k, you're blessed on this planet. Yep. You know, if you travel a little bit, you see the distribution of wealth, it is fucked.

[66:42] **qx()**: Oh, it's so fucked man. It is so fucked. Nothing like bringing out nothing like revealing who an empathetic person really is to have somebody travel and see that shit and see how they react to that. It's a really good litmus test. If you want to see if you want to make sure you're marrying the right person, take them on a trip to a third world country. I'm not kidding. And go around see how see how they react. See how they react to the people there. To the to the to the culture all that kind of stuff. That's gonna be a really good fucking litmus test.

[67:11] **Armeanio**: There's a there's a lot of crypto stuff that I don't know. I hate to say it, but it's just built to leverage first world people in the first world system. Yeah. Yeah. And like, I hope that long term, if we're actually going to create like an open, global, decentralized economy, we can deliver value everywhere. So let's see.

[67:37] **qx()**: That's a hope, Joe. That is the hope.

[67:40] **Armeanio**: That's the only thing interesting long term. Like if it's all about just random fucking meme tokens. Yeah. Like in five years, the only thing we deliver is shit that's popular for three months or six months or a year. I wasted way too much of my life on this shit.

[68:04] **qx()**: No, I mean, that's why I'm here. That's - oh shit, I clicked on the wrong fucking I just fucked up my dev my dev update feed. I'll have to scroll back. But that's that's exactly why I'm here. It's something that I can you know Joe as you say a lot, you know if if you can go to bed at night and put your head on the pillow and - yeah. And I know what I'm doing here. And what we're doing here is on that mission. It's on that course to do something different and do something that benefits all everybody, anybody, anybody, everybody, anybody. I don't know. What is anybody?

[68:44] **Armeanio**: I really think it's anybody, you know, like there's, there's amount of, there's people out there that, you know, they say, oh, we should build for everybody. Right. And I think that's the wrong mindset. I think that if you actually have something that's open and resilient, it's available for anybody that chooses to participate.

[69:05] **qx()**: You're never going to be able to succeed. Yeah, you're never going to get it. Correct.

[69:10] **Armeanio**: You can make everybody happy some of the time
