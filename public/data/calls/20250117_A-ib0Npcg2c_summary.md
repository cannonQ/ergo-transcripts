**Date:** January 17, 2025  
**Call Title:** Weekly Update & AMA - January 16th 2025 PART 2

## Executive Summary

This community call covered multiple aspects of the Ergo ecosystem's development and community initiatives. Key highlights included updates on Ergo merchandise distribution, the thriving Cyberverse gaming platform with 132 active players, and the innovative Cornell BRICK project that will integrate Ergo blockchain technology into real-world university operations. Technical discussions focused on sub-blocks development progress and upcoming node improvements that will significantly enhance transaction confirmation times.

The call also addressed Rosen bridge profitability for watcher operators, with qx() reporting earnings of 12-15 ERG per week, and various community-driven projects including C8's new ergify.xyz platform for SigmaRSV/SigmaUSD conversions.

## Key Discussion Points

• **Merchandise Distribution**: Seeking community volunteers to help distribute Ergo merchandise including "Make Mining Great Again" hats, sweatshirts, and Ergonaut t-shirts

• **Cyberverse Success**: Cross-chain launch showing strong adoption with 132 live players demonstrating sustained growth

• **Cornell BRICK Project**: Real-world blockchain integration for university plot printing services, introducing students to Ergo via tipper bot payments

• **Mining Pool Operations**: Sigmanauts mining pool maintaining 72 gigahash with automated log management scripts

• **Sub-blocks Development**: Progress on EIP polishing, security arguments development, and local DevNet testing with transaction handling improvements

• **Node Improvements**: Pending transaction confirmation enhancements waiting on code reviews that will include transactions in current/next blocks instead of N+2

• **Rosen Bridge Profitability**: Watcher operators earning 12-15 ERG weekly with minimal maintenance requirements

• **Exchange Listings**: Ongoing efforts to connect with Kraken through Mark Greenberg's contacts

## Decisions Made

• Cornell BRICK system will launch when students return on Tuesday, integrating blockchain payments into the university's plot submission process

• Sub-blocks development will focus on completing transaction handling and state transformation proofs before broader deployment considerations

• Node release schedule depends on completing pending code reviews before implementing transaction confirmation improvements
