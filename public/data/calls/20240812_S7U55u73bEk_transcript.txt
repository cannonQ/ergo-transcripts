[00:13] **qx()**: With me, we have a special guest joining us, kushti from Ergo, if some of you are familiar.

[00:19] **qx()**: I know it's been a couple weeks.

[00:22] **qx()**: It's been a busy couple weeks for me.

[00:24] **qx()**: Just didn't get around to cranking it out, but we're going to get back on the horn again and continue weekly with this.

[00:31] **qx()**: I'll try to hold myself accountable.

[00:32] **qx()**: Sometimes it can be difficult.

[00:35] **qx()**: kushti, how you doing, sir?

[00:38] **kushti**: Doing well, so yeah, busy like all the time with all the matters.

[00:44] **kushti**: But yeah, well, what's good in the current situation is that, well, I don't see reason to, I don't know, think about new things, right?

[01:00] **kushti**: Like for a few years, I bombed the forum periodically.

[01:05] **kushti**: about new schemes for something all the time, right?

[01:12] **kushti**: And actually before that, so with papers published and so on, right?

[01:18] **kushti**: And yeah, so for now, there is enough material, I guess, to make a real world impact.

[01:28] **kushti**: I mean, all the elements are known.

[01:33] **kushti**: The only thing is to put them

[01:35] **kushti**: In place, right, so a lot of work, but it's pretty straightforward.

[01:43] **kushti**: Now, I think, well, with what I already have.

[01:52] **kushti**: And so, yeah, so a lot of work towards, well, launching Dexy, soft launching.

[02:01] **kushti**: It's the new trendy term, it seems.

[02:04] **kushti**: Soft launch.

[02:07] **kushti**: Yeah, so, well, Dexy, ChainCash, actually a good progress there.

[02:15] **kushti**: Then, yeah, Sigma 6.0.

[02:18] **kushti**: So, yeah, it's actually on the final stage.

[02:25] **kushti**: And

[02:26] **kushti**: Yeah, so starting working on again on sub-blocks and actually, yeah, well, already doing something here.

[02:40] **qx()**: So yeah, can provide details on every... Are you soloing ChainCash, kushti, or do you have help on ChainCash?

[02:51] **kushti**: Oh, so actually, now it's, mostly, Dusek, soloing.

[02:58] **kushti**: So he is doing a server and, I'm just checking, the code briefly.

[03:05] **kushti**: There is also, a pal of mine, a girl, with a GitHub account, so a lot of, so she's helping with.

[03:17] **qx()**: Did you say a girl with a GitHub account?

[03:22] **kushti**: GitHub account Larukh, yeah, so Dusek and Larukh, so they are working on ChainCash at the moment.

[03:29] **kushti**: So, and Larukh is doing CI, CD, and yeah, then I hope to get her more involved.

[03:40] **kushti**: Or maybe we will get more support from Rust community when it will be more understandable, right?

[03:52] **kushti**: I think there is need to get...

[03:56] **kushti**: to the point where we can show some demos, right?

[04:00] **kushti**: At least because, well, currently people, well, I think mostly get lost, right?

[04:07] **kushti**: Especially people who are not thinking about money.

[04:11] **kushti**: And actually, there are very few people thinking about money, which is quite surprising.

[04:16] **kushti**: I mean, like everyone is using money like every day, right?

[04:23] **kushti**: But

[04:26] **kushti**: not no, nobody's,

[04:31] **kushti**: almost nobody is loving to touch money, I mean, philosophically, right?

[04:40] **kushti**: So, well, thinking about, well, what does this matter about at all?

[04:45] **kushti**: And why do we have money of certain kind, not another in the site today?

[04:54] **kushti**: And yeah, what are possible implications?

[04:57] **kushti**: What is possible future for money?

[05:01] **kushti**: Do we need for single form of money?

[05:07] **kushti**: should we have monies, a plural form, like Professor Lehtarch used all the time and so on.

[05:16] **kushti**: So yeah, well, actually, it's not so well understandable, right, for all the people, but yeah, maybe free banking is already better, right, peer-to-peer banking.

[05:33] **kushti**: Yeah, well, with demos, you can touch, you can play.

[05:40] **kushti**: I think, yeah, it will be more understandable.

[05:44] **kushti**: And then we can get more contributors.

[05:48] **qx()**: Well, how do you...

[05:50] **qx()**: I mean, that's the thing I struggle with whenever I talk to somebody outside of Ergo, at least, is how do you get them to understand what

[05:59] **qx()**: what what ergo is compared to when you when what they're used to seeing on the blockchain is you know these very simplistic forms of gamified gamified muddy systems where there's no not necessarily a a purpose involved other than to entertain i guess you could say some sort of entertainment blockchain as opposed to a real financial system that brings tooling and

[06:27] **qx()**: and financial systems to people that could use it and need it and could replace your everyday stores of value and systems of transfer.

[06:40] **qx()**: So how do you make that leap from one side to the other when

[06:46] **qx()**: I don't even think half these people, you know, these are foreign concepts to them.

[06:50] **qx()**: These are complex things that are brought on chain that they can't even recognize in, you know, their counterparts in the fiat system world.

[06:59] **qx()**: So how do we expect them to embrace and recognize that in what is Ergo right now?

[07:11] **kushti**: Oh, so I think, well, there is a real world need to write in the first place for better money.

[07:22] **kushti**: So maybe not for all the people.

[07:26] **kushti**: So, you know, once I had

[07:34] **kushti**: Lunch, probably, or breakfast, something like that.

[07:39] **kushti**: Back in 2016, even.

[07:41] **kushti**: Around Corfu with some guy working for some bank.

[07:51] **kushti**: in London, or maybe Central Bank.

[07:53] **kushti**: And he asked, why do I need for blockchain if I have visa platinum, right?

[08:05] **kushti**: It works perfectly.

[08:06] **kushti**: And yeah, I'm pretty sure it works perfectly for him.

[08:11] **kushti**: And yeah, I still don't know well why

[08:17] **kushti**: Can blockchain be needed?

[08:18] **kushti**: In this case, it has a replacement, right?

[08:24] **kushti**: But, well, also there are a lot of places around the globe where banks are not working simply.

[08:34] **kushti**: Like in Lebanon, for example, right?

[08:37] **kushti**: So most of banks are just closed, remaining looking like fortresses, right?

[08:45] **kushti**: because just because actually people try to get the deposits back, right?

[08:52] **kushti**: And the deposits, USD deposits, we are storing the central bank, right?

[08:58] **kushti**: And then, yeah, fiat currencies in the process of massive devaluation all the time.

[09:08] **kushti**: So it's not even known what exchange rate will be tomorrow.

[09:17] **kushti**: And then so on, right?

[09:18] **kushti**: So, well, this is the first aspect, right?

[09:24] **kushti**: So, but yeah, even, you know, in better places still there is needs for,

[09:37] **kushti**: Well, seamless and uncensorable peer-to-peer interactions, right?

[09:47] **kushti**: So, well, if you are participating in more complex financial

[09:56] **kushti**: operations right and just bank is selling so well or often it's not convenient to go via banking roads right especially for people who are well kind of excluded from banking systems right so there are tens of millions of them I'm pretty sure even in the US right

[10:26] **qx()**: So are we attacking this wrong, kushti?

[10:30] **qx()**: I feel like those people are not necessarily watching AMA every week or they're not on Twitter looking at spaces or tweets from a blockchain group.

[10:44] **qx()**: I feel like that needs a different approach to try to encapsulate these people and make them aware of systems that may be beneficial to them.

[10:52] **qx()**: That may mean boots on the ground at markets, at other countries, where villages and things like that, where you could essentially adopt some sort of digital currency for your local currency there.

[11:11] **kushti**: Yeah.

[11:12] **kushti**: So, you mean like, that's a Kenyan, for example, experiment, right?

[11:17] **kushti**: Yeah.

[11:18] **kushti**: With, interest, freelance, provided, to the Kenyan, community, cooperative in Kenya, using, excellent, right.

[11:32] **qx()**: Yep.

[11:33] **kushti**: and ergo blockchain and so on yeah i mean so well talking about twitter and so on so well in the in the first place i think it's worth to get kind of proper messaging right so what is differentiating ergo from others right and then yeah spring this message right so

[12:00] **kushti**: And well, Twitter is, I think, not a bad tool after all, right?

[12:08] **kushti**: I mean, like any other tool.

[12:12] **kushti**: So you can spend a lot of time, maybe,

[12:20] **kushti**: Well, with little result, but I think with proper messaging.

[12:25] **kushti**: So yeah, it will work like every instrument.

[12:31] **qx()**: So are we trying to, I think we're stuck trying to,

[12:40] **qx()**: capture those people on other chains and other markets who are specifically utilizing blockchains for the entertainment value of those blockchains or their speculation narratives of those blockchains.

[12:59] **qx()**: Should we not be trying to capture those people at this point?

[13:03] **qx()**: I guess that's my question, or my thought.

[13:08] **qx()**: Why spend all this time and effort to capture people that may not necessarily want to use a blockchain for the reasons that ergo is being built?

[13:18] **qx()**: I mean, it's being built for anyone, but you get the idea there.

[13:22] **qx()**: As opposed to specifically targeting people who would use these financial tools in that aspect.

[13:31] **kushti**: So, well, it's a permissionless network, right?

[13:37] **kushti**: Yeah, I mean, yeah, of course.

[13:39] **kushti**: People are using it for entertainment as well.

[13:42] **kushti**: And I personally do not see any problem here.

[13:46] **kushti**: I mean, if people want to buy Bobber experiments with auction coin or whatever, yeah, why not?

[13:59] **qx()**: Yeah, my general question is though, the amount of effort that's going into, at least outside the Ergo bubble.

[14:07] **qx()**: Should we be more focused on, not necessarily, yeah, no issue with entertainment as far as that goes.

[14:13] **qx()**: But should we be more focused on, which path should we take?

[14:17] **qx()**: Should we focus on everything?

[14:18] **qx()**: Should we continue to focus on right now?

[14:21] **qx()**: Because right now I feel like we're very focused outward, outside of Ergo, onto the people that I see as transient, right?

[14:28] **qx()**: The people that will come to Ergo when something's hot and cool and then leave two seconds later.

[14:33] **qx()**: And then they'll go to Solana or they'll go to Cardano for whatever's hot there for the entertainment purposes.

[14:39] **qx()**: Those, you know, that's fine.

[14:40] **qx()**: Those kind of transients coming through using the system.

[14:43] **qx()**: Yep, whatever.

[14:43] **qx()**: Doesn't matter.

[14:45] **qx()**: It's helpful to the system in a whole, right?

[14:47] **qx()**: But should we be focusing our efforts on those kinds of things, as well as perhaps dig deeper into the core, I guess, the core concept of what a permissionless blockchain can do for people in underserved and underdeveloped and unbanked locations?

[15:11] **qx()**: Like, should we be more focused, should we be focusing more on that moving forward?

[15:18] **kushti**: Yeah, I mean, but the question is who are we here, right?

[15:22] **kushti**: So, I mean, I'm personally pushing for that, but there are people in the community just doing, I don't know, like meme coins or meme coin launch pods.

[15:37] **kushti**: One was just announced today and you care or something like that.

[15:44] **kushti**: MewFinance.

[15:48] **kushti**: Why not?

[15:49] **qx()**: Yeah.

[15:50] **qx()**: Yeah.

[15:50] **qx()**: Yeah.

[15:51] **kushti**: It's funny.

[15:53] **kushti**: Yeah, I mean, people are choosing what to do, right?

[15:56] **kushti**: I mean, considering many factors, like how fun is it, right?

[16:05] **kushti**: Profitability, risk profile.

[16:07] **kushti**: right, because, well, this space, it's got to this entertainment forum, I think, for a reason, right, because, well, building a real peer-to-peer economy is quite hard, right, and touching money is, well, risky, right, often.

[16:34] **kushti**: Let's say it's clear.

[16:38] **kushti**: And yeah, especially when VCs got into the space, so VCs are definitely here, not for, I don't know, redefining.

[16:52] **kushti**: money, right?

[16:54] **kushti**: Nope.

[16:56] **kushti**: Bank then banked, even building peer-to-peer economies, all that hard stuff.

[17:05] **kushti**: I mean, they're here to make money and this is the easiest road, right?

[17:14] **kushti**: Yeah, there are certain problems for sure.

[17:21] **kushti**: I saw, especially in the Ethereum space these days, sometimes VCs are even redefining cryptographic terms.

[17:31] **kushti**: I saw some VCs actually lecturing researchers working in cryptography that the terms should be redefined because that's a game

[17:47] **kushti**: redefinitional words is, well, convenient, right to, to VCs.

[17:52] **kushti**: Is it a market?

[17:56] **kushti**: Yeah, but actually I haven't seen anything like that in any other space, to be honest.

[18:02] **kushti**: When, you know, I mean, some, guys with, big money is coming and starting to, lecture.

[18:11] **kushti**: basically scientists, right?

[18:14] **kushti**: Well, what should they talk about?

[18:19] **kushti**: And well, what terminology should they use?

[18:23] **qx()**: And what terms do you mean?

[18:26] **kushti**: So it's quite shocking, actually.

[18:32] **kushti**: So yeah, I mean, sometimes it's not innocent, but yeah, it's

[18:38] **kushti**: It's not about all those launchpads and so on, right.

[18:45] **kushti**: But yeah, it's about how people are using them.

[18:50] **kushti**: And it's finally about, you know, well,

[18:59] **kushti**: So, unfortunately, well, actors having power in the world of fiat right now coming to this space and trying to set rules because, well, they think that they can do that.

[19:19] **kushti**: And, well, that's worrisome, you know.

[19:30] **qx()**: Yeah.

[19:34] **qx()**: Well, maybe on that note, we dive into the, dive into the updates, kushti.

[19:41] **qx()**: Well, maybe that's too somber of a note.

[19:43] **qx()**: Maybe we have to end the discussion on a more positive note.

[19:48] **qx()**: Whatever, you got some positive news, kushti?

[19:51] **qx()**: Positive thoughts?

[19:52] **kushti**: Oh, but yeah, I mean, development is hard.

[19:59] **kushti**: Going well, right.

[20:00] **kushti**: And actually, well, in recent months, I've seen quite, I don't know,

[20:13] **kushti**: a lot of interest rights to ergo actually having talks with developers and yeah they're pretty keen and well unlike you know like general public so they're not fond of entertainment

[20:37] **kushti**: How is it called?

[20:42] **kushti**: Casino-like systems, right?

[20:45] **kushti**: So, yeah, they are looking for something different and then, yeah, well, I think it's good to promote Cergo among developers, right, technical people.

[20:59] **qx()**: So these are developers you've talked to on other chains that are getting tired of the casino aspect of it, or these are just developers in general you've chatted with?

[21:13] **kushti**: So, yeah, I mean, I've chatted with some people who, you know, in

[21:25] **kushti**: I mean, so for example, one pal of mine is a good developer, right?

[21:35] **kushti**: And well, also a Bitcoin user since like 2010.

[21:38] **kushti**: And yeah, he's definitely not fond of, well, things going on and so on.

[21:51] **kushti**: Yeah, well, among developers, you know, a lot of old Bitcoin users just because initially it was supported by developers and tech-inclined people.

[22:12] **kushti**: And yeah, I mean, many of those people are now not happy with the direction of Bitcoin development and the space in general.

[22:24] **kushti**: But yeah, so after some explanation, yeah, they are fond of Ergo.

[22:33] **qx()**: That's great.

[22:34] **qx()**: That's awesome.

[22:38] **qx()**: All right.

[22:39] **qx()**: All right.

[22:40] **qx()**: Let's dive in, kushti.

[22:43] **qx()**: Alright, first one.

[22:48] **qx()**: We've got Moe and Z with Rosen Bridge.

[22:54] **qx()**: With the ROSEN app, they've developed utility to validate server action arguments, addressing potential security concerns.

[23:00] **qx()**: They address issues related to assets page and enhance its functionality.

[23:04] **qx()**: They enhance, refine, and rectify the decimal drop logic.

[23:07] **qx()**: Oh, that's for EVM.

[23:08] **qx()**: That's important.

[23:11] **qx()**: Rosen Bridge ROSENet work on some errors that occurred during message sending, tried to fix pub sub-issue of increasing message receiving daily.

[23:19] **qx()**: For the scanner, they remove block hash length.

[23:22] **qx()**: Constraint and block entity.

[23:24] **qx()**: Per Rosen chains.

[23:25] **qx()**: They consider transaction failure in, they've considered transaction failure as an EVM chain.

[23:31] **qx()**: EVM integration.

[23:31] **qx()**: As we progress EVM integration, some minor requirements are raised.

[23:35] **qx()**: Hopefully we address them.

[23:37] **qx()**: Meanwhile, the decimals drop refactors under the test to reduce weight on EVM testing.

[23:42] **qx()**: Everything seems smooth.

[23:44] **qx()**: And I think over the last couple of weeks we've had

[23:48] **qx()**: The guards, I think we've had maybe three full updates that we've pushed ahead of the watchers.

[23:53] **qx()**: So I can't remember what version one, but they are, they're definitely, Rosen team's definitely cranking away on the EVM side there.

[23:59] **qx()**: So looking forward to that.

[24:02] **qx()**: All right, we've got CA here for you, kushti.

[24:06] **kushti**: All right.

[24:09] **kushti**: Are those updates mandatory for guards?

[24:13] **qx()**: You know, somebody asked that question in there, and I think some of them are, like the guards will still work with some of them depending on them, but otherwise in order for it to be functional, yes, a certain amount of guards have to update for that to work.

[24:29] **qx()**: Yep, correct.

[24:30] **qx()**: And I think so far we're doing pretty well.

[24:33] **qx()**: You know, we have a simple system of checkboxes on the update, so Rosen will

[24:39] **qx()**: make the announcement to the guards, and the guards will check the green checkbox when they've updated.

[24:45] **qx()**: Of course, you can see in the background who's updated as well, depending on how they report to the chain, I believe, at least in some circumstances.

[24:52] **qx()**: But yes.

[24:54] **qx()**: Yeah.

[24:55] **qx()**: And on top of that, too, I forgot to mention, I think maybe happened in between the last three weeks when I haven't done a dev update.

[25:02] **qx()**: is the Rosen Dev team has promised, and they've done it a couple times already, where they will be much better at relaying announcements to the guards.

[25:15] **qx()**: So then the guards that also hang around in the Rosen channels can then discuss with the community inside the Rosen channel.

[25:25] **qx()**: I think there was a stuck, I can't remember what it was, a week ago there was something that was stuck briefly and they were working on fixing that and they put an announcement right in the channel and I think that's really really helpful because you know there's what 10 of us guards now and that spans across the whole channel.

[25:46] **qx()**: One of us is usually in the channel watching at some point

[25:49] **qx()**: So as long as we all know what's going on, we can better assist than people saying, wow, what's stuck?

[25:55] **qx()**: What's going on?

[25:56] **qx()**: And we say, we don't know.

[25:57] **qx()**: But they're working on that, which is great.

[25:58] **qx()**: So yeah.

[26:01] **qx()**: All right.

[26:01] **qx()**: Let me do, I'll do Spectrum DEX, kushti, because you got your own right after this.

[26:05] **qx()**: All right, we've got Spectrum DEX.

[26:07] **qx()**: The deposit from mobile phone takes a few seconds.

[26:10] **qx()**: This was their Ergo hack entry, which is pretty neat.

[26:15] **qx()**: Very similar to auction.

[26:20] **qx()**: The auction house order book system as well, which is neat.

[26:22] **qx()**: So looking forward to that.

[26:25] **kushti**: That's right, house.

[26:26] **kushti**: Trade house, yep, yep.

[26:28] **kushti**: The trade house, but yeah, so here I see, so they're also doing some centralized fast execution, right?

[26:38] **kushti**: Spectrum pools.

[26:38] **kushti**: But yeah, non-custodial, yeah, Spectrum pool.

[26:43] **kushti**: So yeah, see, so deposit in a few seconds, yeah.

[26:49] **kushti**: That's great, actually.

[26:51] **kushti**: Experience.

[26:53] **qx()**: Gluon Gold working on alternative UI suggestion right there Next implementing more serious and trustworthy design as requested by the community.

[27:02] **qx()**: Thanks for the productive discussion.

[27:04] **kushti**: That's pretty cool Yeah, so he made some design which was about gold looking right?

[27:12] **qx()**: It was gold themed

[27:15] **kushti**: Gold, but initially it was like a Mio Mio kind of design, like anime gold.

[27:23] **kushti**: And then people asked him to make something serious and it was delivered.

[27:31] **qx()**: I see it's in chat a lot, so you can find his post for that if you guys are interested to head into chat.

[27:37] **qx()**: Oh, kushti, you've got a long one, man.

[27:40] **qx()**: Take it away.

[27:43] **kushti**: yeah so ergo protocol reference client rnd yeah so checking ergo node view holder so some parts of the nodes and doing some refactoring towards sub-blocks implementation and also some post score simplification is needed there yeah actually a lot still needed 5 point

[28:12] **kushti**: 0.22 not released.

[28:18] **qx()**: How's 5.1 coming, kushti?

[28:21] **kushti**: Sorry?

[28:22] **qx()**: How's 5.1 with rocks coming?

[28:26] **kushti**: So it will be released along with 0.23 because 0.23 is merged into 5.1.

[28:38] **kushti**: So, yeah, I'm asking, you guys to test the notes, 5.0.23 and the after some testing.

[28:50] **kushti**: So maybe around the end of the, next week, let's see.

[28:55] **kushti**: So, that'll require a full sync.

[28:59] **qx()**: If you go to 5.1, that's a full resync cause it's a new database.

[29:03] **kushti**: Yeah.

[29:04] **kushti**: So, 5.1 is about full re-sync, but, yeah, it's, tested by, some volunteers already on different, platforms.

[29:14] **kushti**: It seems...

[29:15] **qx()**: I think mgPai has tested it quite a bit, right?

[29:18] **kushti**: mgPai and, other guys.

[29:22] **kushti**: So, it was tested on, Raspi, Windows, macOS and so on.

[29:32] **kushti**: And yeah, it seems less platforms will be supported, right?

[29:36] **kushti**: Unlike 5.0.

[29:39] **kushti**: But yeah, on the other hand, it will be more stable and yeah, more performant.

[29:46] **kushti**: All right, so and for some time, well, both 5.0 and 5.1 will be supported, right?

[29:55] **kushti**: So both releases will be done.

[29:58] **kushti**: Yeah, 5.0 will be actually default release, right, in Docker and so on.

[30:12] **kushti**: So our latest talking Docker would be about 5.0.

[30:20] **kushti**: For, I guess, some months to come, well, not to break compatibility, right, not to break workflow of some guys using the latest tag.

[30:38] **kushti**: I have some PRs for 0.24 already for review and yeah they done by external contributors so PGR456 and Zach Balbin so thank you guys.

[30:55] **kushti**: I will review them over the weekend and I guess

[31:03] **kushti**: Well, we will have probably enough material soon to release 0.24 just after 0.23.

[31:16] **kushti**: All right.

[31:17] **kushti**: Next, proposing a readme update for the notes to eliminate some dubious terms, such as official.

[31:25] **kushti**: Yeah, I mean, it was called official repository, which is quite confusing, I guess.

[31:32] **kushti**: I mean, what does it mean?

[31:39] **kushti**: Where can I find official repositories also?

[31:44] **kushti**: Not clear.

[31:45] **kushti**: And also, you know, it's GitHub.

[31:47] **kushti**: So everyone can fork.

[31:49] **kushti**: And well, for every forked repository, you see the same statement.

[31:55] **kushti**: This is the official repository, which is also quite strange.

[32:02] **kushti**: And also make it more juicy and attractive for contributors.

[32:09] **kushti**: So it's more friendly to marketing, I guess, towards developers.

[32:17] **kushti**: And then for Sigma 6.0, a lot of pull requests touched recently.

[32:28] **kushti**: Yeah, two merged, and yeah, more under review and testing.

[32:34] **kushti**: Then ChainCash.

[32:36] **kushti**: Please scroll down.

[32:39] **kushti**: Yeah, so Dusek is finishing blockchain scanning, actually already done.

[32:44] **kushti**: So the next step is to work on receives and other weekends I will play with the server.

[32:54] **kushti**: And yeah, it already has somewhat simplest API.

[33:00] **kushti**: So the idea is to consider

[33:04] **kushti**: API, right, and make some simple client, maybe a command line one even, right, and with that we can find hopefully some hackers around willing to issue money in the hacker circle.

[33:28] **kushti**: So yeah, Laruk is working on CI-CD workflow.

[33:35] **kushti**: Then Dexy code for USE completed the test to remove scan dependency.

[33:44] **kushti**: It's a note from the Dexy backend code.

[33:50] **kushti**: Next steps involve testing the redemption functionality on the Spectrum board, execution backend, reviewing LP.

[33:59] **kushti**: Yeah, that's what I did, reviewing LP redemption contract before deploying it.

[34:05] **kushti**: And today the contract was deployed, so now I'm going to recheck

[34:13] **kushti**: Bank contracts and yeah, with that we can deploy remaining mainnet contracts and start actually Dexy with that.

[34:31] **kushti**: All right, C8.

[34:34] **kushti**: Oh, again.

[34:35] **qx()**: Yeah.

[34:37] **kushti**: Oh, some discussion cook smarts.

[34:40] **kushti**: Yeah, improve free me.

[34:43] **kushti**: Oh, wait, wait, wait.

[34:44] **kushti**: What's what was above.

[34:49] **kushti**: Oh, yes, some discussions.

[34:51] **qx()**: Yep.

[34:55] **qx()**: Awaiting contract template fix and Nautilus for further testing.

[34:59] **qx()**: Created some utility endpoints to support automatic notifications for each DAO.

[35:04] **qx()**: Oh, that'll be nice.

[35:07] **qx()**: Crux.

[35:08] **qx()**: So right now we're using what is a pulseless tipper bot to give us vote creation, vote passed, all those kind of notifications.

[35:19] **qx()**: in our Telegram channels, which is really handy.

[35:22] **qx()**: Crux, subscriptions enabled, allowing saving of filters, presets, et cetera.

[35:26] **qx()**: Also filtering on address on historic trades.

[35:28] **qx()**: Interesting to see all DuckPools and quotations, for example.

[35:32] **qx()**: Gold Oracle made a quick chart for gold Oracle values.

[35:35] **qx()**: Oh, I'm going to have to look at that.

[35:37] **qx()**: Interesting.

[35:39] **qx()**: I wonder what it looks like.

[35:43] **qx()**: Let's see if it loads.

[35:48] **qx()**: Oh, nifty.

[35:50] **qx()**: Cool.

[35:53] **qx()**: Look at Louie doing extra stuff instead of finishing Paideia.

[35:57] **qx()**: Classic Luivatra, huh?

[36:00] **kushti**: Oh, but actually, it was asked by Bruno because.

[36:04] **qx()**: Oh, Bruno asked him to do this?

[36:05] **kushti**: OK. Bruno needs for some data to check Gluon.

[36:16] **qx()**: Cool.

[36:17] **qx()**: All right, and then we have you got ANNBR with Nautilus.

[36:26] **qx()**: All of you, kushti.

[36:27] **kushti**: New version of Abyss with some nice performance improvements.

[36:31] **kushti**: So yeah, please try it, folks.

[36:33] **kushti**: Please help developers with testing and reporting bugs and all that stuff.

[36:40] **kushti**: Fleet SDK.

[36:42] **kushti**: I added exponential delay retrying strategy with fallback URL support for blockchain providers.

[36:50] **kushti**: Added the GraphQL operation URL, override support, added custom big ints mapping supports.

[36:58] **kushti**: Nice, nice.

[36:59] **qx()**: I got to go back on Abyss.

[37:02] **qx()**: I was using that for a bit before he pushed everything to the new, but I don't mind using beta version.

[37:09] **qx()**: Sometimes appreciate the new features.

[37:12] **qx()**: you had a time then yeah chill out some time you think actually is that how you pronounce it Celaut

[37:28] **kushti**: I don't know.

[37:30] **kushti**: Celaut?

[37:31] **kushti**: Maybe Celaut.

[37:33] **kushti**: Celaut?

[37:34] **kushti**: I mean, French style is Celaut.

[37:39] **kushti**: Deutsch or Czech is chill out.

[37:42] **qx()**: Celaut.

[37:43] **qx()**: So node installation, a single command installation and launch for the node has been achieved and tested on Ubuntu.

[37:48] **qx()**: Nice.

[37:50] **qx()**: Terminal user interface, a TUI has been developed in the node to enhance the management of peers, client services, and instances.

[37:56] **qx()**: Reverse proxies are capable to use reverse proxies such as ngrok TCP tunnels for nodes lacking a public IP has been implemented.

[38:04] **qx()**: Damn!

[38:06] **qx()**: Payment system on Ergo.

[38:07] **qx()**: The payment system is currently available only on EVM and is implementation on Ergo is underway.

[38:11] **qx()**: Rep system, efforts to continue for the full integration of the Rep system based on Ergo.

[38:17] **qx()**: Drossomai has been, I think he entered the Ergo hack with the Rep system the last two, I believe.

[38:22] **qx()**: And that's not wrong.

[38:23] **qx()**: Yep.

[38:23] **qx()**: Architecture documentation, development of detailed documentation on the CELOT paradigm.

[38:29] **qx()**: Architecture is ongoing.

[38:32] **qx()**: Basic guides, guides are planned for common tasks, including setting up a node, developing or converting an application to a CELOT service, and compiling it.

[38:41] **qx()**: project context oh here we go Celaut is a network paradigm similar to kubernetes but operates in a peer-to-peer manner enables services to deploy other services dynamically although Celaut is not necessarily tied to ergo or blockchain technology it requires our robust reputation system and payment mechanism mechanism cool all right we've got some discussion here

[39:10] **qx()**: more discussion a lot of discussion oh we've got here we go go ahead take it away we got Mark the Shark, NoRoYogi for Sigmanauts mining pool yeah let's see you want to take it you want me to take it

[39:39] **kushti**: Please take it.

[39:41] **qx()**: All righty.

[39:42] **qx()**: So renamed ergo-tx-factory to SIGS mining core and will be the primary backend for pull moving forward for things like payments, database management, and control.

[39:52] **qx()**: Serial tx integration, able to send n numbers of tx to miners, just need to wait for first or one before to confirm.

[39:59] **qx()**: New server, node online, mining core stood up and needs support from qx, whoops.

[40:05] **qx()**: Mm-hmm.

[40:06] **qx()**: For the PFX.

[40:08] **qx()**: Seems like it's the last step needed, and we can mine on this new server.

[40:12] **qx()**: New domain for UI, ergo-miners.com.

[40:14] **qx()**: Looking to test mining swap tools and features on this new server pool before onboarding everyone.

[40:19] **qx()**: We'll need beta testers for sure.

[40:20] **qx()**: Do we call this pool a fork?

[40:23] **qx()**: qx() is validating testing storage rent on testnet mining core.

[40:28] **qx()**: Yeah, so we gave qx().

[40:29] **qx()**: I spawned up a full server for qx()

[40:32] **qx()**: on, I forget, that service that Paul said recommended.

[40:36] **qx()**: It's like, it's not bad, it's like seven bucks a month for a decent machine that'll do this.

[40:41] **qx()**: And handed the keys over to qx() for testnet and Mining Core pointed to that testnet.

[40:47] **qx()**: I believe I am still mining testnet on that for him to test.

[40:53] **qx()**: And in the meantime, Mark the Shark

[40:56] **qx()**: Hopped on that same service and we're trying to move the entire mining core server because right now The Sigmanauts pool is costing me $100 a month.

[41:05] **qx()**: I think $50 per server.

[41:07] **qx()**: I know it's it's choking me hard So we're trying to move to the other service.

[41:11] **qx()**: That's gonna be like 10 bucks a month or 20 bucks a month per server and

[41:15] **qx()**: So it's going to cut our server costs in a quarter, which should allow the Sigmanauts pool to start making a profit and maybe pay some developers, pay mark, that kind of thing, to upkeep the server.

[41:26] **qx()**: So good things moving forward.

[41:28] **qx()**: It's going to be fun.

[41:31] **qx()**: Okay.

[41:34] **qx()**: We have, let's see.

[41:44] **kushti**: Yeah.

[41:44] **kushti**: So, Celaut description.

[41:47] **qx()**: Oh, that's it.

[41:48] **qx()**: Okay.

[41:50] **kushti**: Then, yes, some guy is trying to run, a custom network.

[41:56] **kushti**: Yeah.

[41:56] **kushti**: Like Ergo fork.

[41:59] **qx()**: And I think that's it.

[41:59] **qx()**: That takes us to yesterday, Thursday.

[42:02] **kushti**: Yeah.

[42:12] **qx()**: Yep.

[42:12] **qx()**: And now we're in today.

[42:14] **kushti**: Yeah.

[42:15] **kushti**: Well, to today, a new version of SigmaRust released.

[42:19] **kushti**: So yeah, that's actually quite good.

[42:23] **kushti**: So after many months without new releases, so finally we have a new SigmaRust version.

[42:36] **qx()**: Who works on that?

[42:37] **qx()**: Who's the main person that works on that?

[42:41] **kushti**: So for new release, we have three contributors.

[42:44] **kushti**: So PGR, 456, Dusek, and UnknownBear, yeah.

[42:57] **kushti**: Awesome.

[42:59] **kushti**: So yeah, actually quite good that the development is continuing.

[43:03] **kushti**: And then, yeah, my call.

[43:07] **kushti**: As always, there is need for more contributors for Ergonauts.

[43:12] **kushti**: There is need for tests, especially for additional indices and stuff like that.

[43:19] **kushti**: There is need to review peer-to-peer where refactoring for sub-blocks and sidechains implementations.

[43:28] **kushti**: Tests for 6.0 activation, sigma 6.0 is also would be better with contributors while tests and audits are needed.

[43:47] **kushti**: For SigmaRust, we need actually for a lot of work still to get full-fledged interpreter.

[43:55] **kushti**: so well next milestones are costing implementation and 6.0 implementation in Rust and yeah for ChainCash we are looking for contributors yeah so yeah I am not sure yeah when but I think that ChainCash could be commercially viable right

[44:27] **kushti**: with time so well because it's about well actually doing money and yeah doing clearing rights a lot of possibilities for mutual credit.

[44:43] **qx()**: So you're with ChainCash during the spaces that you spoke about utilizing, you had to have some baseline of value, right?

[44:55] **qx()**: That's embedded in these contracts so that we know what things are worth and you're using gold for that, using the gold oracle?

[45:02] **kushti**: So it's used as a unit of accounts, right?

[45:07] **kushti**: But the system is working like, you know, it's only you who defines, well, what a note is worth of, right?

[45:23] **qx()**: So- Right, well, you and the person that accepts it from you.

[45:27] **kushti**: Yeah, so it's your decision to accept it or not, but even when we are talking about how to value it, so there are different possible algorithms here, right?

[45:46] **kushti**: Because you have a graph of previous transactions, you have reserves, you have debt, you can make some guesses about redemption.

[46:02] **kushti**: of this depth and so on.

[46:05] **kushti**: And based on that, you can get very different results, right, for quality of analysis.

[46:12] **kushti**: There will be some default algorithm, but then, yeah, actually, yeah, it's kind of, you know, assembly layer for peer-to-peer financial systems of different kind.

[46:31] **kushti**: So you can have your own subnetwork with very quality nodes, right?

[46:38] **kushti**: Or maybe just a trust-based subnetwork with your friends, right, where you just issue nodes.

[46:50] **kushti**: You guys issuing, right, within the subnetwork.

[47:00] **kushti**: Cool.

[47:00] **kushti**: All right.

[47:03] **qx()**: All right, well, I'm glad you joined me for this return of the dev update, kushti.

[47:10] **qx()**: We'll keep at it.

[47:11] **kushti**: All right, so yeah, well, a lot of things going on.

[47:18] **kushti**: I mean, we even have a new SigmaRust release and mod.com.

[47:26] **qx()**: Yeah, we've got on the social side.

[47:28] **kushti**: We've got there are also a lot of talks about doing something for you.

[47:38] **qx()**: Something with what?

[47:39] **kushti**: Yeah, sorry.

[47:44] **kushti**: So there are a lot of talks of doing something with Oracle pools.

[47:50] **kushti**: For example, right, so maybe there will be some updates there and so on.

[47:56] **kushti**: And in ErgoDevs DAO, we also discuss a lot of things like

[48:02] **kushti**: Supporting tutorials, right?

[48:05] **kushti**: Supporting certain integrations.

[48:07] **kushti**: Actually, our guy mgPai is doing Keystone, for example, right?

[48:12] **kushti**: And then we also considering what to do with the Explorer, right?

[48:17] **kushti**: So there are like few unfinished attempts to do something on top of, well, as a replacement of

[48:28] **kushti**: Currents Explorer.

[48:32] **kushti**: So yeah, let's see how it goes.

[48:37] **qx()**: Yeah, on the social side, we're excited about going to.

[48:42] **qx()**: Mark the shark and I are going to join Dan, I believe Brian from Palmyra, and Joe from Rosen Bridge aspect of it, Armenia.

[48:57] **qx()**: We'll join up at the RareEvo.

[49:00] **qx()**: Hopefully, we'll be able to set up a nice block.

[49:02] **qx()**: Dan can bring a nice comfy couch.

[49:04] **qx()**: And we're going to bring wallets that we're going to hand out to people.

[49:09] **qx()**: I have to remove the BRICK that somebody deposited in all of them.

[49:12] **qx()**: So I have to write a script to purge that, unfortunately.

[49:18] **qx()**: And make some more.

[49:21] **qx()**: Maybe we have 100 wallets.

[49:22] **qx()**: We'll probably make a couple more cards to hand out.

[49:26] **qx()**: We have beautiful, what's it called, hats that came.

[49:32] **qx()**: They're red hats and they say make mining great again on the front of them.

[49:37] **qx()**: And on the back they have the word ergo.

[49:40] **qx()**: So those are going to be fun.

[49:41] **qx()**: We're going to try to sell those.

[49:43] **qx()**: And we also have shirts that we're going to try to sell crew neck and t-shirts.

[49:48] **qx()**: We have, I believe Joe's bringing some Rosen Bridge shirts as well.

[49:53] **qx()**: And it's going to be fun.

[49:55] **qx()**: We're going to try to spread the word of Ergo at Rare and just get people notified of what we are and keep them in our mind and back around the back of their mind or at the front.

[50:06] **qx()**: Hopefully we can get more people to do wallets and interact with the ecosystem there.

[50:11] **qx()**: So that'll be fun.

[50:12] **qx()**: Looking forward to that.

[50:15] **kushti**: All right.

[50:15] **kushti**: All right.

[50:16] **kushti**: So yeah, sounds like a lot of fun and a lot of Ergo promotion around Rare.

[50:24] **kushti**: Yeah, and yeah, so I'm also going to write a paper for Amix, right?

[50:33] **kushti**: So abstract got accepted.

[50:35] **kushti**: So now I need to write a paper on ChainCash basically.

[50:39] **kushti**: So yeah, we'll spend some time in coming weeks on that also.

[50:47] **qx()**: All right, sounds good.

[50:48] **qx()**: Thanks so much everybody for watching and we'll see you next week.

[50:52] **qx()**: Ciao.

[50:54] **kushti**: Ah, see ya, thank you, bye.
