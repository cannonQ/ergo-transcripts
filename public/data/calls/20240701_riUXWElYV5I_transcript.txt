[00:14] **anon_real**: Introducing Trade House, developed by anon_real and the auction house team, a trustless order book DEX with partial filling.

[00:22] **anon_real**: AMM trading such as Spectrum suffer from several issues. Low liquidity causes high slippage which results in overpaying by the users. The price is fixed at any moment and the user has no options to put orders with different prices. Swaps result in high fluctuations of the market price.

[00:39] **anon_real**: Order book trading, on the other hand, do not suffer from these issues.

[00:43] **anon_real**: Trade House comes with several features. One, all orders are protected by audited contracts and are executed on chain, no intermediary, no trust bottlenecks.

[00:53] **anon_real**: Two. Buy and sell orders can be partially filled and there is no need for exact matching of the amounts.

[01:00] **anon_real**: Three. Trustless off-chain bots immediately match orders, which results in a smooth and fast user experience.

[01:07] **anon_real**: Four. All order statuses, such as amount already executed, latest transaction, etc. can be viewed live with immediate updates.

[01:16] **anon_real**: Five, Trade House currently offers 50% less fee than the SigmaUSD Bank Box, and it offers competitive fees to Spectrum. However, as users will suffer from high slippage on Spectrum, they can significantly benefit from Trade House.

[01:31] **anon_real**: Six, buy and sell orders can be filled with other kinds of liquidity such as Spectrum LP boxes. Although not implemented yet, this could make Trade House the single needed hub for trading. As an example, a user could place an ERG sell order for $5 per ERG. As soon as some other order can match that, or a Spectrum LP box or SigmaUSD bank box can offer the same price, the order will be executed.

[02:00] **anon_real**: You can connect your Nautilus wallet or any wallet supporting Ergo Pay. We support a variety of trading pairs. To fill out the price and amount fields, you could manually enter the desired values or click on the available funds in your wallet. You can also use the slider to specify the percentage of your assets. You can also click on the sell by order rows so that the price and total values are entered in the fields.

[02:31] **anon_real**: You can monitor all your active orders. You can cancel all your active orders by clicking on Cancel All. You can cancel one of your orders by clicking on the cross icon.

[02:48] **anon_real**: You also can see relevant information about your order such as the executed percentage and its mining status. In the Order History tab, you can see all your previous orders. If you click on the three dots icon, you will see the detailed executions of the order.

[03:08] **anon_real**: In this example, the sell order price was 4.17 SigmaUSD. However, the average execution price was actually 4.29 SigmaUSD. In this case, the user has sold at a higher average price than what they were supposed to. Likewise, in this example, the buy price was set at 6.83 and the average execution price was 6.66. The user has paid less than they were supposed to.

[03:37] **anon_real**: Please give Trade House a try and thanks for watching.
