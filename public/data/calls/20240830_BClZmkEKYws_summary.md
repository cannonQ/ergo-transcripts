# Ergo Blockchain Community Call Summary - August 30, 2024

## Executive Summary

This weekly AMA focused primarily on Node 6.0 development progress and ChainCash implementation. kushti reported releasing the first alpha of Node 6.0 for local deployment and announced that the sub-blocks implementation is progressing steadily. The Banxa project has reached a significant milestone with three servers running and full collateralization achieved, preparing for mainnet deployment. On the community side, qx() discussed Sigmanauts' transition to more cost-effective mining infrastructure and the implementation of formal community standards to manage growing pains in their chat channels.

The discussion also covered potential expansion into Russian markets following recent crypto-friendly government announcements, though kushti noted the crypto scene remains largely underground there. Questions arose about Ergo's relationship with other chains, particularly regarding Cardano's recent partner chain announcements, with the consensus being that Ergo's existing cross-chain capabilities through Rosen already position it well without requiring formal partnerships.

## Notable Quotes

> "For most jurisdictions, that's not the case [regarding developer liability]. I think the most problematic thing is when you're running centralized service and allowing a lot of things there, like Telegram is doing." - **kushti** on regulatory concerns

> "The future of Ergo with Rosen kind of depends on cross-chain tech and Ergo being a place where other chains can come in and do things." - **qx()** on cross-chain partnerships

> "For the same amount of money, much more economic activity would be produced, right? So it's not just a developer getting ERG and holding it or selling. This is about also producing economic activity for friends on the way as well." - **kushti** on ChainCash economic benefits
