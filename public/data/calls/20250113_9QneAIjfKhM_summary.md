# Ergo Community Call Summary
**Date:** January 13, 2025  
**Title:** Ergo in 2025 | Predictions and Possibilities

## Executive Summary

This community call featured core developer kushti and community member Armeanio discussing Ergo's roadmap for 2025 and broader philosophical perspectives on cryptocurrency development. The conversation covered major technical developments including sub-blocks implementation (inspired by Prism and Parallel Proof of Work), progress on Ergo 6.0 development and audits, and cross-chain interoperability improvements. The discussion emphasized Ergo's commitment to maintaining true peer-to-peer network architecture while scaling performance, contrasting this approach with industry trends toward centralization.

A significant portion of the call focused on monetary systems and stablecoin philosophy, with kushti advocating for algorithmic stablecoins and metal-backed assets over traditional fiat-pegged stablecoins to reduce trust dependencies. The conversation also explored future developments including ChainCash (a free banking system), enhanced mining decentralization through projects like Lithos, and the critical need for growing the developer and researcher community in 2025.

## Key Discussion Points

• **Sub-blocks Implementation** - New EAP draft published for spreading network load over time rather than concentrated every 2 minutes, moving bottlenecks to network bandwidth
• **Ergo 6.0 Development** - Ongoing development and audit processes, enabling cross-chain relays and trustless bridges
• **Scaling Philosophy** - Emphasis on peer-to-peer network preservation vs. industry trend toward centralized validators
• **Stablecoin Strategy** - Focus on algorithmic stablecoins (Dexy) and metal-backed assets over fiat-pegged alternatives
• **Cross-chain Interoperability** - Bitcoin relays, Sigma sidechains, and expansion of Rosen Bridge ecosystem
• **ChainCash Vision** - Free banking system allowing individual money issuance with voluntary acceptance
• **Mining Decentralization** - Discussion of Lithos development and non-outsourceable puzzle concepts
• **Community Growth** - Critical need for more developers, researchers, and educators in 2025

## Decisions Made

• Continue development of sub-blocks with upcoming improvements to the initial EAP draft
• Maintain focus on peer-to-peer network architecture despite industry centralization trends  
• Prioritize algorithmic stablecoins and metal-backed assets in ecosystem development
• Expand cross-chain capabilities and Rosen Bridge integration across more ecosystems
• Focus 2025 efforts on growing the developer, researcher, and educator community

## Notable Quotes

**kushti on industry scaling approaches:** *"Most are not even trying, right? So, well, the general approach unfortunately seen now is just to make networks less peer-to-peer, more centralized, right? So, well, to rely on just, well, powerful validators in data centers... But then, yeah, well, it's also about, well, increasing centralization, right, in regards to many aspects like validation."*

**kushti on proof-of-work vs proof-of-stake:** *"I actually think proof-of-work assets are getting appreciation and the more proof-of-stake assets we have, the more valuable perspective proof-of-work assets may become. Because well, proof-of-stake is giving holders free money basically, right?"*

**kushti on Ergo's vision:** *"With all those things we may say that Ergo is actually a kind of end game for crypto envisioned by godfathers of Bitcoin... now I think we have a pretty well-established and detailed approach, which is finally allowing to achieve dreams from 2000s."*
