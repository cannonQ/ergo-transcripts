## Executive Summary

This episode of P2Podcast featured a comprehensive discussion about meme tokens in the Ergo ecosystem with special guest PepERG, the anonymous founder of the PepERG meme token. The conversation explored the broader landscape of meme tokens versus meme coins, their role in blockchain education, and their place within Ergo's decentralized ethos. The hosts also briefly touched on recent quantum computing developments and their minimal impact on blockchain security.

The episode concluded with a live raffle drawing for PepERG's recent "snipe competition," where participants had to purchase precise amounts of tokens to qualify for prizes ranging from $380 to $760 worth of PepERG tokens. The discussion highlighted both the speculative nature of meme tokens and their potential educational value in teaching users about DEX mechanics, slippage, and blockchain fundamentals.
