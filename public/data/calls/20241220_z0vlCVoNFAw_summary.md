# Ergo PoW Blockchain Community Call Summary
**Date:** December 20, 2024  
**Call Title:** Weekly Update & AMA - December 19th 2024

## Executive Summary

This community call focused heavily on quantum resistance developments and real-world adoption initiatives. Kushti provided extensive insights into Ergo's quantum-resistant properties, explaining that while the proof-of-work consensus is already quantum-resistant due to its reliance on hash functions, digital signatures would need post-quantum alternatives in the future. However, he emphasized that quantum computers capable of breaking modern cryptography are still decades away, giving the ecosystem ample time for gradual implementation of alternatives.

The call also highlighted significant progress in practical applications, with qx() detailing the successful deployment of a BRICK token system at Cornell University for large-format printing payments, demonstrating blockchain integration with existing university infrastructure. Multiple development milestones were announced, including upcoming Node 6.0 release candidate, Ledger integration progress, and Oracle Pools completion.

## Key Discussion Points

• **Quantum Resistance Strategy**: Ergo's proof-of-work consensus already quantum-resistant; post-quantum signature schemes being evaluated for future implementation
• **Cornell University BRICK Token**: Successful deployment of blockchain payment system for student printing services using Discord tipper bot integration
• **Development Updates**: Node 6.0 RC coming this week, Sigma interpreter release next week, sub-blocks development resuming
• **Ledger Integration**: Final audit discussions with authorized third-party company
• **Community Initiatives**: Sigmanauts multisig migration completed, Mac Pro sales on MewFinance successful
• **Cross-Chain Expansion**: Cyberverse integration with Ronin gaming chain, using CYPX tokens across multiple blockchains
• **Art and Tokenization**: Upcoming talk on property rights and programmable money for modern art events
• **Mining Pool Updates**: Storage rent payments and bonus token distributions implemented successfully

## Decisions Made

• Node 6.0 release candidate to be released this week after testing
• Sub-blocks development discussions to resume next week
• Community calls/Twitter spaces planned for mid-January after New Year
• Book drafts on real-world adoption to be open-sourced with community contributions
• UTXO Alliance Twitter spaces participation planned

## Notable Quotes

> "We are kind of building a cathedral here right so we are trying to build something which will last for generations to come right because otherwise, it's not that interesting, right? I mean, to build just something for one day." - **kushti** on long-term blockchain development philosophy

> "Proof-of-work is not just the most efficient consensus algorithm, right? But it's also, well, post-quantum already, because yeah, hash functions are secure in the presence of quantum computers." - **kushti** on Ergo's quantum resistance

> "The idea was to let's get these kids involved in they're, you know, try to jump their own economy. There's so many like tools that are passed around between the semester... Why not create some sort of system of value where these kids can have something that's valuable to them?" - **qx()** on the Cornell BRICK token implementation
