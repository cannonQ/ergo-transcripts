# Ergo Blockchain Community Call Summary
**Date:** October 11, 2024  
**Call Title:** Ergo PoW Blockchain - Weekly Update & AMA - October 10th 2024

## Executive Summary

This community call featured Ergo founder kushti and community member Armeanio discussing recent developments and upcoming milestones for the Ergo ecosystem. The call highlighted significant progress on multiple fronts, including the release of two reference client versions (5.0.23 and 6.0.0.2) with Sigma 6.0 functionality, ongoing development of sub-blocks technology, and preparations for Rosen bridge's transition from its "light" phase to full asset support. The discussion also covered hardware wallet integration progress, upcoming audits for Dexy, and the broader philosophical approach to maintaining Ergo as a truly decentralized, unstructured peer-to-peer network.

Armeanio provided updates on Rosen's public testing phase with 38 watchers and outlined the roadmap for expanding asset support and moving toward full launch. The conversation also touched on the challenges facing the crypto industry, including recent regulatory actions against market makers and the centralization trends in many blockchain networks, contrasting these with Ergo's commitment to maintaining decentralization principles.

## Notable Quotes

**kushti**: "After all, that's what does matter, right? So it's, well, to me personally, it should be about making a real world impact."

**Armeanio**: "I do think that creating some sort of potential avenue for people to swap hard assets for digital assets is a really interesting idea."

**kushti**: "So yeah, I mean, a few years ago, a lot of efforts were spent on making a solid foundation for the Ergo protocol. And well, there is no any reason to sacrifice that and to do vaporware instead."
