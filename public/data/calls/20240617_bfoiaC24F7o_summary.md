# Ergo Blockchain Community Call Summary

**Date:** June 17, 2024  
**Topic:** Wallet Wonderland | ErgoMinnow | ErgoHack VIII

## Executive Summary

ErgoMinnow presented the results of a comprehensive wallet survey project completed for ErgoHack VIII, in collaboration with CannonQ. The project surveyed 113 Sigmanauts to identify desired features and pain points in Ergo's current wallet ecosystem. The research resulted in a 35-page document analyzing six major Ergo wallets: Nautilus, SafeW, Minotaur, Satergo, Ergo Mobile, and Paper Wallet.

The survey revealed that while Sigmanauts are generally satisfied with current wallets, Nautilus and Ergo Mobile are the most popular due to their ease of use. However, significant gaps remain, particularly around transaction history, in-wallet swaps, mixer integration, and official Ledger support without dev mode requirements. The project aims to serve as a comprehensive resource for both users and developers to understand wallet capabilities and community needs.

## Key Discussion Points

• **Survey Results**: 113 Sigmanauts completed the comprehensive wallet survey
• **Top-Rated Wallets**: Nautilus and Ergo Mobile emerged as favorites due to ease of use
• **Most Requested Features**: Transaction history, in-wallet token swaps, mixer integration, and improved UI/UX
• **Ledger Integration Issues**: Community strongly dislikes the current requirement for dev mode/sideloading
• **Ultimate Wallet Vision**: Easy-to-use interface, asset/NFT support, mixer integration, and comprehensive transaction history
• **Technical Challenges**: NFT loading issues (potentially IPFS-related) and front-end usability concerns
• **Future Development**: Document will be expanded over 8-10 weeks to serve as a comprehensive wallet resource

## Decisions Made

• The research document will be published publicly for community and developer access
• The project will be expanded over the next 8-10 weeks to create a comprehensive wallet information hub
• Video tutorials and documentation links will be consolidated in one location for easier access
• The findings will serve as guidance for wallet developers on community priorities

## Notable Quotes

> **ErgoMinnow**: "I think it'd be even more beneficial on an Ergo wallet because you'd have an open source wallet and you'd have an open source Mixer... This would probably change the wallet game, I think, in crypto."

> **ErgoMinnow**: "I feel like it's a good thing to be paranoid in crypto because this industry is really shady. So that [Ledger dev mode] needs to be tackled because the overall community is not trusting a sideload or a dev mode."

> **ErgoMinnow**: "I think in crypto, or even on Ergo, our front end is probably what's lacking the most. If we can make it just easier to use... an easy to use interface, so wallet devs, this is what the people want."
