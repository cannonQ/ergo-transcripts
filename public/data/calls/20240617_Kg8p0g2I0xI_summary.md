# ErgoHack VIII Community Call Summary

**Call Date:** 2024-06-17  
**Call Title:** Ways to Bring Ergo to College Students | Reva and Henry | ErgoHack VIII

## Executive Summary

Cornell University students Reva and Henry presented their ErgoHack VIII submission focused on strategies to expand Ergo's presence among college students. As active members of Cornell's blockchain developer community, they identified college campuses as untapped markets where students are eager to explore innovative technologies. Their comprehensive proposal outlined multiple frameworks for student outreach, including developer workshops, learn-to-earn programs, campus ambassador initiatives, and improved educational resources.

The presentation emphasized leveraging existing university blockchain clubs and student organizations to reduce implementation costs while maximizing reach. They highlighted Ergo's unique value propositions—particularly its 96% public token allocation and decentralized nature—as key differentiators that should be prominently featured in educational materials. Their approach combines immediate engagement tactics (hackathons, workshops) with long-term community building strategies (ambassadorships, scholarships) to create sustainable growth within the college demographic.

## Key Discussion Points

• **Developer Workshops & Hackathons**: Partner with university blockchain clubs to host in-person events with ERG prizes and company recruitment opportunities
• **Learn-to-Earn Integration**: Implement 5-7 minute educational quizzes in wallet onboarding (like Nautilus) with token rewards, similar to Coinbase's model
• **Campus Ambassador Program**: Extend the existing Sigmanauts program specifically for college students to facilitate campus-level Ergo adoption
• **Educational Content Creation**: Develop BuildSpace-style video tutorials and hands-on coding experiences for beginners
• **Student Recognition**: Highlight student builders in weekly developer updates and provide scholarships to incentivize continued development
• **Community Engagement**: Host Discord office hours and dev support sessions to create personal connections between students and core developers
• **Leveraging Ergo's Strengths**: Emphasize unique features like Python compatibility, flexible node configuration, and superior decentralization in educational materials

## Decisions Made

No formal decisions were made during this presentation, as it was a hackathon submission showcasing proposed initiatives rather than a decision-making session.

## Notable Quotes

> "At Cornell, we have a rather large blockchain developer group. And we think it'd be really cool to see how we could bring Ergo's transformative solutions into the hands of the youth that could help be the leaders of Ergo someday." - **Reva**

> "At schools like Cornell, there's such a high population of kids that really do care about new technologies emerging in this ecosystem and would love to learn from the people that built it." - **Henry**

> "What I think would be cool is if Ergo... maybe you highlight student builders and you maybe provided smaller scholarships just to promote the ecosystem, but also like incentivize students to continue building on this chain in particular." - **Reva**
