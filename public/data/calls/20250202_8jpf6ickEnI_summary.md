# Ergo Dev Update Summary - February 2nd, 2025

## Executive Summary

The Ergo development community reconvened for their first dev update in several months, hosted by qx() and featuring Joseph Armeanio, former Ergo Foundation member. The call covered significant technical progress across multiple projects, including the upcoming Sigma 6.0 testnet activation, Rosen Bridge developments, and various ecosystem improvements. A major theme was the contrast between speculative crypto activity (including recent political meme tokens) and meaningful blockchain utility, with Ergo positioning itself as focused on real-world applications.

The call highlighted substantial progress on core infrastructure, with Kushti advancing sub-block implementation and input ordering, while ChainCash L2 development continues. Community projects like Mark the Shark's mining pool innovations and qx()'s BRICK token deployment at Cornell demonstrate practical blockchain applications. The discussion emphasized the importance of building robust, open-source systems while maintaining focus on genuine utility over speculative trading.

## Key Discussion Points

• **BRICK Token at Cornell**: qx() demonstrated a seamless blockchain payment system for 3D printing services, showing how students can use cryptocurrency transparently through Discord integration
• **Crypto Market Commentary**: Extensive discussion about recent political meme tokens and the contrast with meaningful blockchain development
• **Sigma 6.0 Progress**: Kushti has resolved all known issues and is proceeding with public testnet activation
• **Rosen Bridge Update**: Armeanio reported a bug in Binance Smart Chain integration that has been patched, with release pending further testing
• **Sub-blocks Development**: Continued progress on reducing block time dependencies for better user experience
• **SigmaUSD Oracle Updates**: Plans for coordinated mainnet updates with reduced oracle pool members for testing
• **Mining Pool Ecosystem**: Strong advocacy for community-driven mining pools over purely commercial services
• **Layer 1 UX Focus**: C8's emphasis on improving user experience directly on the base layer rather than through abstraction layers

## Decisions Made

• Proceeding with Sigma 6.0 public testnet activation after bug fixes
• Coordinated SigmaUSD oracle pool mainnet update to be scheduled
• Continued focus on layer 1 user experience improvements over multi-layer abstractions
• Emphasis on supporting community-driven mining pools

## Notable Quotes

**qx()**: "I said, and yes, we're fully aware of how ridiculous 90% of the blockchain antics have been. So welcome to some actual meaningful usage of this technology."

**Armeanio**: "Technology will not solve human nature. That's the end all be all of this discussion is that you have that side of human nature where people will want money in profit for no work, no input."

**Armeanio**: "Until Mark's pool is the leading pool in terms of hash rate, if you're mining Ergo, what the fuck are you doing pointing to any other pool?"
