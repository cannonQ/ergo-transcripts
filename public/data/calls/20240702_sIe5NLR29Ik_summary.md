# Paideia DAO Demonstration - Community Call Summary
**Date:** July 2, 2024  
**Title:** Paideia | Marty | Ergoversary Summit 2024

## Executive Summary

This community call was a comprehensive demonstration of the Paideia dApp, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) platform built on the Ergo blockchain. Marty provided a complete walkthrough of the DAO functionality, demonstrating the entire process from token staking (voter registration) to proposal creation and voting. The demo used beta tokens (B Paideia) available through the Ergo faucet, showcasing how users can participate in governance through smart contract interactions.

The demonstration highlighted Paideia's current capabilities including token-based voting, proposal creation with various action types, configurable quorum settings, and on-chain governance mechanisms. While still in beta, the platform shows promise for decentralized governance with plans for UI improvements and additional features before the official launch.

## Key Discussion Points

• **Token Staking Process**: Complete walkthrough of staking B Paideia tokens to register for voting rights in the DAO
• **Proposal Creation**: Demonstration of creating proposals with different categories, actions (fund transfers, DAO config updates), and duration settings
• **Voting Mechanism**: On-chain voting process using staked tokens with real-time results and quorum tracking
• **Smart Contract Integration**: All interactions are processed through Ergo smart contracts with transaction verification
• **DAO Configuration**: Adjustable parameters including quorum requirements (currently 15%) and approval thresholds (60% yes votes required)
• **Platform Features**: Discussion forums, proposal referencing, member activity tracking, and social features (likes, follows, comments)
• **Beta Status**: Current limitations and planned improvements to user interface and functionality

## Decisions Made

• No formal decisions were made as this was a demonstration call
• Mentioned plan to rename "staking" to "voter registration" for clarity since not all DAOs will distribute tokens
• Commitment to improve UI elements, particularly making DAO configuration changes more user-friendly
• Plans to exit beta status and implement fixes for minor issues like activity page display

## Notable Quotes

> **Marty**: "You don't want to stake all your tokens because you need some to create proposals and things like that."

> **Marty**: "This DAO requires a 60% yes vote... and quorum has been achieved, so I do have enough to meet the quorum."

> **Marty**: "Hopefully we'll get out of beta shortly get some of these things fixed and we'll be on our way."

## Participants

• **Marty** - Presenter/Developer - Led the complete demonstration of the Paideia dApp functionality and provided technical explanations of the platform's features and smart contract interactions
