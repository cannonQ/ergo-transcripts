# Ergo PoW Blockchain Community Call Summary
**Date:** August 23, 2024  
**Call Title:** Ergo PoW Blockchain - Weekly Update & AMA - August 22nd 2024

## Executive Summary

This community call focused heavily on recapping the team's experience at Rare Evo conference, where they showcased Ergo, Palmyra, Rosen Bridge, and Sigmanauts in a combined booth. The conference served as a "proof of life" event for the ecosystem, with strong interest in their "Make Mining Great Again" hats and positive reception for Palmyra's real-world commodity tracking applications. Technical updates included progress on Sigma 6.0 development, Dexy's soft launch preparations, ChainCash mainnet testing, and ongoing work on Ergo Names integration.

The team discussed lessons learned from the conference, including the need to adjust swag distribution strategies and booth positioning for future events. They're implementing a new NFT-based system for selling remaining conference merchandise through Auction House, demonstrating practical utility of their own ecosystem tools.

## Key Discussion Points

• **Rare Evo Conference Recap**: Combined booth showcasing Ergo ecosystem projects with strong interest from both exhibitors and attendees, particularly for Palmyra's commodity tracking use cases
• **Sigma 6.0 Development**: Initial pull requests submitted for testnet, with kushti working on developer network testing and new transaction features
• **Dexy Soft Launch**: LP Redeem contracts deployed, bank contracts under review, soft launch expected within weeks
• **ChainCash Progress**: First mainnet transactions completed, contract issues resolved, ready for expanded testing
• **Ergo Names Update**: 70% complete with contract refactoring underway, will support payment in any token and recursive subdomain names
• **Conference Swag Strategy**: Implementing NFT-based merchandise system through Auction House for remaining $4,000+ inventory
• **Developer DAO Challenges**: Acknowledgment that current structure needs revision due to slow progress and limited time dedication
• **Hardware Wallet Integration**: Keystone integration progressing faster than Ledger due to fewer approval requirements

## Decisions Made

• Implement NFT-based swag selling system using Auction House without Anne Unreal's assistance
• Sigmanauts mining DAO will vote on Paideia for Sigma 6.0 implementation 
• Plan to adjust conference strategy for future events, including free swag distribution and better booth positioning
• Expand ChainCash testing to include more community members like Jamai

## Notable Quotes

**kushti**: "I think in general, the Ergo position is quite unique at the moment. It's fully open sourced and the most permissionless, license-wise financial stack probably."

**qx()**: "It's nice to return. It's nice to go to get a reminder of what we do here and why we do it, which is great... we kind of live in a bubble around Ergo where everything's shared where we all push towards things that potentially will better society."

**mgPai**: "They coded a game, an entire game called Doom on-chain... every movement that you made, every shoot, everything, anything you did in the game was an on-chain transaction... 32 transactions a second."
