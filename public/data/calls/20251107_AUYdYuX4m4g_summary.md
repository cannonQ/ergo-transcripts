# Ergo Community Call Summary - November 6th, 2025

## Executive Summary
The call covered infrastructure improvements with community-run explorer nodes, upcoming USE stablecoin launch with CLB liquidity bootstrap event, privacy features discussion, and various development updates across the Ergo ecosystem. Key focus was on decentralizing infrastructure and preparing for the USE stablecoin launch through MewFinance.

## Key Topics Discussed
- **Infrastructure Decentralization**: Community members taking over explorer hosting to reduce centralized dependencies
- **USE Stablecoin Launch**: CLB (Community Liquidity Bootstrap) event details and mechanics explained by Richi
- **AI Integration**: Discussion of Ergo's potential in AI payments and GPU mining intersection
- **Privacy Features**: Comparison with other privacy coins and Ergo's optional privacy approach
- **Development Updates**: Ergo Wallet maintenance needs, Rosen Bridge Bitcoin Runes progress
- **Sigma Quest Game**: Tim Erg's AI-powered puzzle game launching Sunday with 200+ ERG prize pool
- **Sub-blocks Development**: DevNet launch planned in coming days with Raspberry Pi contributors

## Notable Announcements or Decisions
- **USE Stablecoin CLB Event**: Target 300,000-400,000 ERG bootstrap with 100 CLB tokens (9 decimals), 2-year liquidity lock
- **Infrastructure Migration**: Three community machines shipped, database optimization needed before switching from Hetzner
- **Sigma Quest Launch**: Sunday morning start for AI-powered scavenger hunt game
- **Rosen Bridge Milestone**: Bitcoin Runes final test phase started, deployment expected next week
- **DevNet Launch**: Sub-blocks testing with international Raspberry Pi contributors in coming days

## Technical Concepts Explained
- **CLB Token Mechanics**: Represents proportional share of locked liquidity pool, tradeable on secondary market, redeemable after 2 years with accumulated fees
- **Optional Privacy**: Ergo's approach with ErgoMixer, stealth addresses, and native cryptographic primitives vs mandatory privacy coins
- **Infrastructure Resilience**: Comparison of peer-to-peer node networks vs cloud provider dependencies
- **eUTXO for AI**: Potential advantages for AI agents managing multiple tokens compared to account-based models

## Action Items or Follow-ups
- **Ergo Wallet Maintenance**: Seeking Kotlin/Java Android developers for SDK updates and new releases
- **USE White Paper**: Richi to publish CLB event documentation and marketing campaign (2 weeks before launch)
- **Twitter Spaces**: Planned sessions on USE launch details and Lithos testnet mining
- **Database Optimization**: Complete community explorer node setup and testing before migration
- **MHS Monitor Release**: Consider mobile wallet publication with multi-sig support
