## Notable Quotes

**kushti on Ergo's unique positioning**: "Well, aside of like, three, maybe blockchains excluding Ergo. So, well, all others are basically the same, right, in regards with value proposition... A lot of things are doomed to fail because they are not well designed monetary wise."

**qx() on community engagement**: "Can you imagine if 10,000 people in the telegram chat of investors or holders of ERG, thought of one little thing they could do to help forward ERG into the world. That would be a huge lift, just a tiny bit by everybody."

**kushti on storage rent significance**: "With storage rent, you have fixed supply, right? So it's not inflationary, not deflationary... And yeah, that's actually quite interesting and well. It's actually quite exciting to have some unique asset, right?"
