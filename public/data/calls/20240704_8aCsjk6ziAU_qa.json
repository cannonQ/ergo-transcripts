      "asker": "implied_from_presentation",
      "answer": "Storage rent is slowly unwrapping and will become more significant over time. As it grows compared to block rewards, it may create interesting dynamics where miners jump between pools based on efficiency in storage rent collecting. There are proposals like EIP-45 on storage rent redistribution that may need discussion in late 2024.",

In ChainCash, it's up to the receiver of a payment whether to accept it or not based on the quality of collateral and trust involved between parties.",

      "answer": "Fair Initial Mining Offerings (FIMOs) use mining as a distribution mechanism, which is much more fair than ordinary airdrops. Airdrops are always messy with lots of cheating, insider games, and manipulation. With mining-based distribution, there's no way to cheat because you need to do real work with your hardware.",

It will have a rich sidechains ecosystem with the safest DeFi for users, largely built for peer-to-peer trustless and secure interactions. It will bring value to the real world with tools for stable pricing and elastic supply based on high-quality proof-of-work assets, all built by a decentralized community following a research-driven approach.",
