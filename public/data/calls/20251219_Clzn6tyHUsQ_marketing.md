**Tweet 1:**
🧵 Big moves in the Ergo ecosystem: The Ergo Foundation is transitioning key infrastructure to community ownership, including market making operations and explorer infrastructure. This was always the plan - bootstrap the community, then hand over the keys. Here's what's changing:

**Tweet 2:**
Market making is moving from professional services (~$12K/quarter) to community-run bots. Unlike other chains that profit from your trades, Ergo's market makers have never taken spreads from the community. Several experienced community members are stepping up to continue this approach.

**Tweet 3:**
Explorer infrastructure (~$720/month) is transitioning to P2P DAO nodes plus two main explorers. The goal: eliminate single points of failure and encourage developers to run their own explorers. Decentralization in action.

**Tweet 4:**
SigmaUSD is now live on MewDEX with native pools and freemint/arbmint functionality. You can swap, provide liquidity, and the system automatically balances prices between LP and bank. Finally - native SigmaUSD trading on a DEX.

**Tweet 5:**
Real-world blockchain utility update: Cornell University is running a campus token economy on Ergo for recycling, 3D printing payments, and student services. Students earn tokens for recycling paper and following safety protocols, then spend them on campus services.

"The main core of Ergo, the one thing which made me love Ergo was the blockchain and not the price or not the crypto aspect of it." - @HQ3rr 

This is what real adoption looks like. Join the community call recordings on YouTube for full updates.

**Quote 2:**
"There are thousands of things you can do on blockchain which are not crypto related. You can build anything on a blockchain. You can use the blockchain as a database, as a validator, as a verifier, as an amplifier or whatever you want to."

**Quote 3:**
"So Ergo has never done that, ever. That was a whole stipulation for the market makers that we get... our market makers currently do not make profits off our trades, off our supporting the spreads and debts."
