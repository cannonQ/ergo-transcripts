# ErgoHack 9 Community Call Summary
**Date:** October 26, 2024  
**Topic:** UX challenges in web3 | Big Pampa

## Executive Summary

This ErgoHack 9 community call featured a comprehensive presentation by Nico from BigPampa, a design agency specializing in Web3 and blockchain projects. The talk focused on the critical role of user experience (UX) in achieving mass adoption for Web3 applications, identifying five major UX challenges that plague the blockchain industry and providing actionable solutions for developers and builders.

Nico emphasized that poor UX is one of the primary barriers preventing mainstream adoption of blockchain technology, arguing that users simply won't engage with products that are difficult, overwhelming, or confusing to use. The presentation was specifically designed to help ErgoHack participants build better, more user-friendly dApps by adopting a user-first approach rather than leading with technology.

## Key Discussion Points

• **Decision Fatigue Challenge** - Web3 users face overwhelming choices (blockchains, wallets, protocols, settings) with higher risks than Web2, leading to paralysis and non-adoption

• **Expanded User Roles** - Web3 users must simultaneously act as custodians, liquidity providers, governance participants, and crypto accountants, requiring new skill sets

• **Communication Problems** - Most Web3 apps use impersonal jargon, provide poor feedback, and fail to give users clarity on transaction status and next steps

• **Tech-First vs User-First Approach** - Industry tendency to prioritize blockchain implementation over solving actual user problems, leading to products that fail to gain traction

• **Technological Constraints** - Builders often accept poor UX patterns simply because "that's how it's done" rather than innovating new solutions

• **Practical Solutions** - Specific recommendations including predefined settings, clear labeling of options, contextual UI, optimistic loading patterns, and empathetic communication

• **Mass Adoption Responsibility** - Warning that improved UX will bring more users but also greater responsibility to prevent exploits and protect inexperienced users

## Decisions Made

• ErgoHack participants were encouraged to implement user-first design principles in their hackathon projects

• Builders should involve UX/design teams early in development rather than treating design as an afterthought

• Community members should actively provide feedback on dApps and demand better user experiences

## Notable Quotes

> "At the end of the day the deliverable is not your perfectly written code, the bug free audited smart contract or even the groundbreaking technology. The final deliverable is the user-facing product, and when you do not think of the user, products tend to fail." - **Nico**

> "Do not simply accept something just because. If it is making the overall experience worse for the user, try figuring out a way, a workaround, somehow to fix it." - **Nico**

> "As your apps become more accessible, easier to use, more user-friendly, intuitive, they will start bringing more users in. And the overall risks of people losing their funds, interacting with bad actors and making harmful decisions will skyrocket." - **Nico**
