[00:13] **qx()**: Hey everybody, welcome to our Ergoversary video about the history of the Sigmanauts, where the Sigmanauts were, where they've been, where they're going perhaps in the future, and what better guests than all three of us I think.

[00:29] **qx()**: We have Noah who is here really near the beginning with the Sigmanauts, we have myself who joined later on, and we have glasgow who's been the omnipotent power of the Sigmanauts and the EF all the way through this whole ordeal.

[00:43] **qx()**: So I thought we could bring a good spectrum of people and experiences to this chat.

[00:48] **qx()**: How are you guys doing tonight?

[00:51] **glasgow**: Yeah, not doing too bad. Thanks for having us.

[00:53] **qx()**: I just want to note that it is 2:15 a.m. for poor glasgow. So we really appreciate you taking one for the team.

[01:03] **glasgow**: Yeah, no problem, no problem. You've done it plenty of times.

[01:08] **qx()**: And Noah, it's been a while since you've been on video. This is a real treat.

[01:12] **Noah**: It has been a while. Yeah, it's good to see you guys, honestly. It's been a minute. I'm excited to be here.

[01:20] **qx()**: Was the last thing you were on, was it a Hash It Out or was it a Pulse or something like that?

[01:26] **Noah**: It must have been a Hash It Out with CW.

[01:29] **qx()**: I've been bugging CW to get that show back up. I think we can work on them slowly about it.

[01:35] **qx()**: All right, let's start from the beginning. We can't go down a tangent in the first 30 seconds, guys.

[01:45] **qx()**: Let's start from the beginning. So how are the Sigmanauts conceptualized? What was thought about? Why do we need a group called the Sigmanauts? Which one of you is around at the beginning? Who started it? Let's start with those questions, whichever one of you has the answers.

[02:02] **glasgow**: I think we're both around from the beginning of the Sigmanauts and it kind of came about because we were all kind of organizing that way, informally anyway, and getting together and doing things in the chats. So I thought to give it a bit more structure.

[02:17] **glasgow**: After we had done a few ventures, tried to speak to some marketing firms and they were all a bit expensive for us. And I realized we had a lot of great people in Ergo. So try to create structure to incentivize that and get people involved that way. So they wouldn't get stuck trying to get answers or figuring out what they could do. They could just jump straight in and get stuck right in, basically.

[02:43] **qx()**: Noah, what was your experience early on?

[02:47] **Noah**: Yeah, it's interesting. I feel like, I think glasgow just DMed me one day and was like, Hey, there's this new group.

[02:57] **Noah**: But to be honest, like in the beginning, there was just a bunch of people doing stuff already. And before the Sigmanauts were even really a thing, like glasgow said, he was trying to create some structure. And then it kind of evolved naturally.

[03:18] **Noah**: Like at that time, I was really, really heavily involved in the Cyberverse and I was doing a ton of stuff back then. And there are other people that were doing all sorts of stuff too. And it was kind of a way to create some cohesion around goals.

[03:40] **Noah**: With such an open ecosystem, everybody's kind of doing their own interests. And that can be great, but it can also result in kind of fractured prioritization of tasks. And yeah, the group was trying to sort of bring people together into a place where we can discuss more focused goals and ideas.

[04:05] **Noah**: And yeah, in the beginning, it was super loose. And then eventually, I mean, you were there when we eventually made like the sort of founding documents and the goals of the group and I wasn't there.

[04:21] **qx()**: Are you talking to glasgow?

[04:24] **qx()**: No, I don't think I was there yet. I came in 2022.

[04:28] **Noah**: Maybe at the end of 2022 and I think you guys are saying it was quite loose for a long time.

[04:37] **qx()**: So you guys didn't have a DAO but there, you know, there's no DAO structure back then like we have now. What did you guys do to keep that community together and have some sort of coherence and some sort of structured voice come out from those kind of things?

[04:50] **qx()**: I mean even now in chats, we'll have some idea that we need to execute. We'll put it in chat and somebody will, I'll say hey guys, this is what I think. Somebody else will come and say this is what I think and somebody else will come and say that's shit, here's what I think.

[05:06] **qx()**: And that's where it stops. It's just not, you know, it can just die. So how do you get, you know, and that's where Paideia is nice. We're like, screw it, we're just going to put up a vote on Paideia. Whoever likes it votes for it, who doesn't like it votes against it. And there's a discussion.

[05:19] **qx()**: It would be much more difficult. And it was in the earlier days when I got there, too, at least. How did you guys manage that back in the day to try to get some sort of consensus or some group ideas to come out there without a tool like Paideia?

[05:34] **glasgow**: I think it was maybe just more, it was more tight knit, I think. So it was kind of less of those things happening. And there was maybe one or two, but I don't really know if they're sticking out to me. Yeah, people just kind of did their own thing.

[05:50] **qx()**: More like-minded people together kind of thing.

[05:53] **glasgow**: I think so. There's probably less of us, maybe less people, but more active at the time. Yeah, just kind of worked that way for a while. I think you maybe arrived in that kind of growing pain point of it a bit later when those structures kind of became more necessary.

[06:17] **glasgow**: But yeah, just kind of worked like that for a while. Before that, we did have the Sigmanauts group before that, but it was just kind of, people just added into it. There's no voting process or anything. And obviously new people were like, I don't want to add something in. This is like core devs and kushti scripts. We have to wait for them to do it. And they're not thinking about stuff like that. So it's just kind of this barrier that you can't get past. So it's a way to get people into it.

[06:45] **qx()**: So what was your initial kind of mission statement? You got to forgive me because I can't remember it. I know when we kicked it back into gear at that point in 2023, perhaps, we had a lot of guys rewriting a mission statement, kind of the drive of what the Sigmanauts are. What was your original intent back then? Did you have a proper mission statement posted up on the Sigmanauts Handbook or the Sigmanauts Handbook?

[07:13] **glasgow**: Yeah, I think we had one that I drafted and I think Cafe and maybe a couple other people helped out with. It's probably mostly the same as what we've got now, certainly less refined but the same ideas though.

[07:26] **qx()**: And Noah, you just kind of got sucked in at the beginning.

[07:33] **Noah**: Well, I was just going to say like, in the beginning, it really was very loose compared to now. Yeah, it really was just like taking this already existing community and just kind of putting a label on it. And then slowly over time, trying to create incentive structures or trying to create some weekly meetings, just something to create some cohesion.

[08:06] **Noah**: It was a very gradual process, if I'm remembering correctly. And it was kind of like, I think glasgow kind of like pulling us by the necks into the structure because it was so loose. But then over time, eventually we got the multi-sig wallet going. And now with Paideia, it's night and day. We can actually have a DAO structure now rather than a Discord group or a Telegram group.

[08:49] **Noah**: Yeah, it's come a long way. It's pretty cool.

[08:54] **qx()**: So when you guys have the idea for this or when you were loosely forming it, are there any other, I mean, I know it's hard to ask this question because you could ask me this question and I'd be like, fucked if I know, but...

[09:06] **qx()**: Did you take any like examples from other chains that you liked that are doing a great job of this kind of community organizing that's very loose? I mean, when I look at other chains, I see these organizations as some sort of paid leader or paid group or somebody that's like on the board of some foundation that's like the owner of the chain that's running it kind of thing that I don't at least what I see, I don't see a group like this exists outside of Ergo that's just fully loosely people that come in, have like minded, well sometimes like minded ideas and try to move on those. Did you guys see that in the beginning when you're trying to form this group or did you feel like you guys are pioneers in this kind of aspect of trying to almost do something that's impossible?

[09:55] **glasgow**: I looked at quite a few of the other ambassador programs and took bits and pieces that I liked from it. I think the Link Marines was quite successful.

[10:05] **qx()**: Which one? It wasn't really... Link Marines?

[10:07] **glasgow**: It was the Link Marines, so it's not actually a DAO, it's just people that support Link, but they were quite successful in the marketing and how they reached out to people and stuff.

[10:15] **qx()**: Did they have any power over the chain themselves? Like, did they have any ability to enforce like change in the chain? Or they just kind of were there to bring social awareness and marketing?

[10:26] **glasgow**: Yeah, I don't think it's officially, maybe at some point they did. No, I just looked at the ways they can grow the community, community agency and stuff. And just took bits and pieces from various ones that I liked, but nothing really inspired it directly.

[10:44] **qx()**: And Noah, what did you feel when you joined the Sigmanauts? Did you feel like you were joining to just kind of have a club to get together with guys and gals or, you know, probably one gal? I don't know. Do we have any gals in the Sigmanauts at this point, guys? Or did you think, you know, I'm going to join this group and we can actually enforce change in Ergo and steer it in the direction that we want with the power of this group?

[11:09] **Noah**: In the beginning, prior to the Sigmanauts officially being a thing, it definitely felt like kind of a small club, just tight knit. A boys club. Trying to just like, no, no, no. We had Jenny.

[11:27] **qx()**: That's right. That's right. Oh, we should have brought Jenny on for this. Damn it. I should have buzzed her up. Damn it.

[11:34] **Noah**: I'm not sure what she's up to these days, but yeah, it didn't feel like, I was pretty ignorant of DAOs at the time. I didn't really know how they worked in other ecosystems. Like, I don't know if, does Ethereum Classic have, like, I know they've got their group of people that are sort of keeping things alive over there, but...

[12:06] **qx()**: Well, it's still, it's kind of probably led by Bob Summerville, right? Or Summerville, Summerwell?

[12:12] **glasgow**: Yeah, I think he's, that's the foundation. Yeah, well, the details, but I think for some reason, so.

[12:22] **Noah**: I feel like that'd be a thing that usually... Sorry, the thing that I usually see, the thing that I usually see is on proof of work blockchains, there tends to be more grassroots community initiatives because there's no emissions to pay for things like marketing or efforts to get the message out.

[12:54] **Noah**: Whereas on proof of stake, a lot of the time, there's a foundation that can pay for that stuff because they've got their staking rewards or whatever. It tends to be snowballing wealth in that way on proof of stake. Whereas with proof of work, it doesn't really work that way. I think things tend to be a lot more community driven on proof of work.

[13:23] **Noah**: And that's not just on Ergo. I know Ravencoin has a pretty dedicated community, or at least they did back in 2021. I've got no idea what they're doing today. But then, like, Alephium, they have their own community of dedicated people, and they've got their DAO. They're, you know, they have emissions. But anyway, yeah, it's a very different social dynamic on proof of work compared to proof of stake and the bottom up kind of structure.

[13:58] **qx()**: Yeah, that's the first time that I've thought of that. That's a very good point. And you do definitely see that where there's not a reward system or a payment system or some sort of catalyst of funds coming into some place to support it. These guys are on their own. It's good old you got to pull yourself up by your own bootstraps to get that kind of thing going and that's one thing we suffer with, you know, even now we got...

[14:32] **qx()**: You know, we've had some grants from the Ergo Foundation. We're working on trying to get revenue funds, you know through our mining DAO, the mining pool that we set up. We're designing an app with Four Eyes Consulting which is mgPai and LGD to try to get income by the use of that app and I'm hoping by some miracle that we can pick up the Sky Harbor contracts and take their open source front end and really buff it up with paying a dev to do it and maybe take some UI fees off of that in the future.

[14:59] **qx()**: So we're really trying to position ourselves to where we can get some funding coming into the treasury, because if there's one thing that I noticed that before we had funds in the treasury, people, I don't know if they took votes as seriously as they do now, when there's like 5,000 ERG attached to the vote, and you put it up there. You know, people have a much stronger opinion, it seems, when you bring in that kind of money, or you put the treasury up there and start getting it funded. People are like, oh shit, there's 30,000 ERG in our treasury, we need to actually maybe pay attention a little bit. Not everybody, it doesn't work for everybody. But it does seem to get a little more people involved and a little more serious when when you have that.

[15:38] **qx()**: So yeah, it'd be amazing if we could say, you know, hey, 1% of every transaction fee on the entire blockchain comes to the Ergo Foundation treasury and the Sigmanauts Treasury, that'd be amazing. But in that case, I wonder if you'd get... Yeah, there's something to be said, I think about actually physically working for a revenue stream and the appreciation that comes in with that and then the carefulness you do when you have to blow it and you have to spend it on things, as opposed to just getting it dumped into your wallet, you know, for free without any kind of work coming in.

[16:14] **qx()**: Now you've got me thinking, Noah, I'm not going to be able to go to bed tonight.

[16:17] **Noah**: Well, I mean, it's kind of the big unknown of crypto in a way. It's like all of these chains, all of these dApps, all these projects by and large have been subsidized by printing. And there's only a small handful of projects that are actually profitable and running off of revenue.

[16:45] **Noah**: You can go on DeFi Llama and look at the fees versus revenue, or like fees earned versus costs to run whatever infrastructure on chain or whatever. And the vast majority are not profitable. And long term, that's kind of like where we need to move toward for things to, you know, actually be meaningful. Otherwise, we're kind of just like spinning our wheels and hoping things work out.

[17:22] **Noah**: So yeah, the fee revenue thing is a really big concern. It makes sense that Sigmanauts should be thinking about it too.

[17:30] **qx()**: Yeah, it'd be fantastic now to be like, it'd be fantastic to be able to say to somebody, okay, you're going to run this section of this thing that's going to take 10 hours of your week. Here's, you know, 100 ERG a week or 50 ERG a week and be amazing to be able to support that kind of thing with the community.

[17:48] **qx()**: Otherwise, you know, when you have time and, you know, what do you say to somebody that's volunteering their time all the time and then they don't come through on a few things? Are you like, what the fuck, you know, you should be working on this and doing that. No, you're like, well, I'm grateful for the things that you've done so far and I'll catch you next week when you're ready to come back and do this.

[18:08] **qx()**: So, you know, this, in this kind of community experience, a lot of, you know, kind of like the Ergo hash rate as people complain about.

[18:17] **qx()**: glasgow, so my question for you glasgow is what what in your ideal world and when you guys conceptualize the Sigmanauts what would be a successful Sigmanauts group to you and let's say by 2030? What would you see as successful for the Sigmanauts at that point?

[18:40] **glasgow**: I think that the idea that me and Joe discussed in chat originally was to have it originally be like multiple DAOs would spin off from it. So you'd maybe get a DAO that does audits and an ecosystem project could pay them a certain amount. They'd provide the devs, do the audits and get a badge and stuff.

[19:03] **glasgow**: And essentially you'd have those different DAOs for different things. You can think of all doing their own little tasks. Ideally being funded through the chain for the users and people that need it and just kind of working autonomously.

[19:17] **qx()**: So the funding would come from users voluntarily funding the chain, the DAOs?

[19:22] **glasgow**: Well, it depends on the DAO. The one for the audit DAO would be projects paying for the audit. But there was a bunch of different ones. So there's ErgoScript Review as well for kind of audits, a marketing DAO.

[19:37] **qx()**: So like the marketing DAO would be big enough to where projects would want to use them as a marketing tool and pay for it?

[19:46] **glasgow**: Yeah, they could see that that was the best way to get the word out on Ergo. These DAOs experience, they can do kind of sanity checks and check it from over, kind of vouching the community to whatever extent is possible really, down to the assumptions, but X, Y and Z looks pretty good. We can't tell you some other stuff, but that kind of stuff would be ideal to have set up and running seamlessly.

[20:15] **qx()**: So I feel like that's the hardest thing to do nowadays, now in the Sigmanauts, because we have about, what, 60 Sigmanauts candidates and maybe 50, 60 Sigmanauts or somewhere, and there may be about 100 in total blend between Sigmanauts and Sigmanauts candidates. And you think with that many, you could say, Okay, guys, let's sit down. And let's say we need a group of people to just run the Treasury. We need just a group of people to run the Sigmanauts mining pool, just a group of people to, you know, work on this auditing badge system that you mentioned.

[20:48] **qx()**: I find that extremely, extremely difficult. Even now, I can't imagine that was that like impossible back in the day, when you first started out when you're first organizing?

[20:58] **glasgow**: Well, it would have been to do that kind of stuff that requires people to dedicate a lot of time consistently. But in the future, if there's funds coming in, that's the incentive. If you can just get a couple of devs that you know you can ping, they'll do it for a set fee. Make sure the workload should be easy enough to get people to sign up for that, I think.

[21:20] **qx()**: So focus on a revenue stream that you can then support these subcommittees with actual payment of people and go from there.

[21:29] **qx()**: Well, I think that's where we're headed glasgow.

[21:32] **glasgow**: Yeah, that's actually, I think, I can't remember, but some of these actually started making the framework for a few of those DAOs. It was Cafe, it was something else. Yeah, definitely.

[21:48] **qx()**: Yeah, the idea was that I think we took your idea and spun with it, it was like, you know, have like a gold, a silver and a bronze kind of certification. Yeah, so that so the project comes to us and says, hey, you know, and we take a look at it, have the devs look at it. And we'd have like a point system where it's if you're doxed, you know, it may have this or if you're anonymous, there's actually a debate about that, whether that should be a plus or minus.

[22:12] **qx()**: But you know, if your smart contracts have been audited by what group or what people or how many people, what stages, that would be another set of points where your stuff is hosted. If your stuff is open source, it would have maybe a different meaning of a badge to it as well or a little add on mark to the badge.

[22:30] **qx()**: Yeah, so I think there's a lot of opportunity for that for sure. Because you see in chats all the time, right? Somebody comes in and is like, hey, Morphic or hey, kushti, can you please review my smart contract? Maybe when they get to it when they can, but it would be nice to have a dedicated system to do that.

[22:48] **qx()**: Yeah.

[22:49] **glasgow**: Yeah. Well, even now you could just hire, was it Four Eyes?

[22:54] **Noah**: Four Eyes, yeah.

[22:55] **Noah**: Yeah, I was going to say that.

[22:57] **glasgow**: Like back when we started it, there was like maybe five, 10 devs that could do stuff like that. And they couldn't do anything else because they were so busy with other things. It's a bit better now because we're getting more long-term devs that have been on the chain for a while and know what they're doing. Can build that number up. Even back then it was pretty impossible.

[23:17] **qx()**: So the big question, the question that we should end with, because I want glasgow to get some sleep. How do we onboard the next, let's say we have 100 users right now, how do we onboard the next 100 Sigmanauts? And how do we ensure that... So how do we start this nicely without getting too much drama?

[23:38] **qx()**: And having a group of diverse people and diverse ideas is very difficult, especially when it's all volunteer. You have people that have ideas that are completely contrary or opposite or not aligned with other people's ideas. And your idea is that you're all supposed to work together and try to come up with an idea that moves the Sigmanauts forward, that moves the Ergo blockchain forward.

[24:04] **qx()**: So the question is, with all that in mind, and what we've seen recently, since we've really tried to start pushing larger onboarding, we've removed the barrier for Sigmanauts candidate. It's essentially you want to be a Sigmanauts candidate, somebody will bring you in, you can be a Sigmanauts candidate that day. And then you prove yourself and you want to become a voting Sigmanauts or be on a committee, then we put you in for a vote.

[24:29] **qx()**: But with that, we've noticed there's been, Noah, when's the last time you're in the Sigmanauts chat? Do you peek in once in a while now during your break?

[24:39] **Noah**: Yeah, I check it all the time. There's so many messages I don't keep up on all of it.

[24:45] **qx()**: So it gets a little drama heated, guys. You know, you have misunderstandings, you have language barriers, all that kind of stuff, where somebody may be saying something and it's in English, but it's not their first language. So it comes off maybe a little strong or maybe a little sparse and somebody takes it another way. All those feelings, all those personalities, all those different mindsets in a group.

[25:09] **qx()**: I can imagine it's going to even get messier with the next hundred users. So how do we better prepare for that? How do we go out and get those hundred users and make sure that we're not going further down the path of people not getting along as well or more diverse, more pockets and corners of groups that may be split off and don't talk to each other or that kind of thing? How do we make sure that doesn't happen, guys?

[25:34] **glasgow**: Yeah, I think it's a complex question, but I think a lot of it at the moment could be attributed to growing pains and price down.

[25:45] **qx()**: Price down, that doesn't help, does it?

[25:49] **glasgow**: If you get more structures in place, more people using the DAO, more familiar with it, what they can do, how they can help. That's more clear, I think that will help as well. Yeah, I think a lot of the problems at the moment are just growing pains really.

[26:06] **qx()**: You know you said price down and that reminds me of, I was just in Miami last month and we went to the Everglades and it was about three or four weeks into or maybe a week or two into the season that was supposed to be rainy but it wasn't rainy yet. So, you know, the channels are down, and you look in the channel, and there's like four alligators on top of each other. And there's literally a fish like every one foot, and they're bumping into each other all the time. So when you said prices down, it really reminds me of that kind of ecosystem where the water is low, everybody, the resources are scarce, everybody's bumping into each other every two goddamn seconds, and it's pissing them off.

[26:50] **qx()**: So and you know, yeah, that's a tough one to get over. That's for sure. I think that's an individualistic thing that everybody needs to be kind of mindful of, you know, am I, what am I here for at this time? Am I here to bitch because the price is down? Or am I going to, did I join the Sigmanauts to try to elicit change or facilitate change and push an ideal forward of what I want Ergo to be? So yeah, that gets to everybody, you know, at one point or the other.

[27:20] **Noah**: Yeah, it's tricky, because I'll just say real quick, it's tricky because just the nature of incentive and people wanting to do things for a reward. When price is bad, people feel bad. But yeah, it's just like, I'm so tired of that, honestly.

[27:52] **Noah**: Like, I've been more dormant on Sigmanauts stuff than I was last year. And a large reason for that was just fatigue from the baseless speculation price bad day after day. It's like, I don't know. There's more to talk about than the price of Ergo day after day.

[28:25] **qx()**: There is. Sorry, go on.

[28:30] **Noah**: I don't even know where I'm going with this. It's just like. I think it's honestly, I think it's part of the growing pains of the chain itself due to the aggressive emission structure. I think coming out of, what is it, 2025 or 2026 is when the emissions completely taper off and we get into the hard fork emissions. I can't remember exactly what year, but yeah, it's just a long tail of the eight-year emission curve and people getting frustrated and the people that are here for whatever reason they want to be here, you know, they'll contribute however they want to.

[29:25] **Noah**: And I think it really is just growing pains, like glasgow said.

[29:30] **qx()**: I find I'm always at an impasse, but a struggle between trying not to shame people for, you know, when can price go up? And then also trying not to... I feel that if I say to somebody, if people like, what's wrong with the price? Why isn't the price going up? And as a Sigmanauts, you know, that happens in the Sigmanauts group, there are people in the group that that's one of their main concerns still too.

[30:01] **qx()**: So I feel if I say, you know, well, I mean, you may be here for the price, but I'm here for this reason, this reason, this is what I think Ergo could become. This is, you know, what I want to see Ergo be used as. And I'm talking about like money for people whose paychecks are lower three weeks after they get the paycheck, you know, every couple of weeks, the paychecks lower because of inflation in the country.

[30:23] **qx()**: I think a lot of people in crypto, especially the people that can afford to dump, you know, $10,000 on a goddamn, you know, dog with hat or dog with bat token have no concept that of what the use case of crypto could possibly be and the tools that are being made for it.

[30:42] **qx()**: So I find myself, you know, torn between two places of still trying to want these people to engage for the most part, you know, because they're here and they're utilizing the chain, whether they're speculating on it or not. And that might be the only reason. But at the same time, trying to push and educate that, you know, Ergo, at least, you know, I don't know about other chains policies or other chains mission statements, Ergo, at least is, you know, here for different reasons, at least I feel than just number go up.

[31:18] **qx()**: So I feel that's, glasgow, you know, you must experience that, you know, ever since the beginning, right, all the time, just trying to combat that.

[31:27] **glasgow**: Yes, it's kind of the nature of the game and I think part of the growing pains is because the community was so small back then, you get this big influx of users, the buyers and the prices quite high, emissions low, so they end up losing money. People could talk about price all day, but there's really not much you can say about this kind of...

[31:51] **glasgow**: It's a bit more complex and tying it to one thing, even though people like blaming it on one thing, they blame the algorithm, they blame marketing. I mean, yeah, it's, I'm sure the miners are dumping, a little bit of all those things, of course, but at the same time, you can't compare it to the way the market, the trends like nobody's doing that great and the difference between doing really great and bad, it's like a couple dollars, it's not like going to be at 20-30 dollars, maybe three, but even then like sometimes you get dips outside the trend and above the trend and it's more the price that matters on a short time scale because you can't really tell on that time scale and anything that happens on that time scale you need to look at a longer time scale and just...

[32:45] **glasgow**: Best is not to focus on it and just do what you think adds value. Try and expand the chain that way, make it work, make it usable. And you make a usable chain with fun things on it that people can do, DeFi, gaming. I think that's the way it's going to spread. People see a game they want to play or a loan they want to take. They often don't even look at the chain and what the chain is, and they just know they want to participate. And that's what's going to bring in users and ultimately help the price.

[33:21] **qx()**: And potentially those guys are the ones that stay, too, as opposed to the speculators. And I've said over the past weeks that I've really had a kind of, you know, I wasn't hardcore on, you know, these memes are going to get people here. You know, I was accepted that that was a possibility, of course. And it was a method.

[33:42] **qx()**: But lately, I don't know if it's just maybe feeling winter coming on already, you know, even though summer just started, winter depression. But lately, I feel that, that kind of, at least in the Sigmanauts, you know, we get pushes to be like, hey, guys, let's get this influencer to pitch us. And right, we look at the price, and it's like $30,000. Well, we know that, was paid $30,000 from SNEK, right, or something like that. Maybe that's not well known. But somebody told me that. So I'm going with it.

[34:15] **qx()**: So I mean, imagine, you know, that's all of the Sigmanauts treasury. Is that worth spending the entire Sigmanauts treasury to get one influencer to be our buddy for a couple months to bring in people that most likely are going to be speculating right and want the number to go up and are dumping at the first signs of price increase and then leaving and they're not utilizing your chain anymore.

[34:45] **qx()**: So was that, I constantly question myself, is that worth it? Is that temporary gain of an influx of users that are then going to leave and they're just there for speculation worth it?

[34:59] **Noah**: I think this is my personal opinion. My personal opinion is that speculators are not necessarily sticky and people that come from memes are going to look for memes elsewhere as well. You know, people go where profits are. I don't think that flash in the pan kind of way of allocating resources is the path to long-term growth personally.

[35:34] **qx()**: So how do we, how do we, I'm sorry, glasgow, you go so I don't interrupt the flow. I've got another question after this.

[35:39] **glasgow**: I was going to say, yes, it's not really, it's just that you could do that. Of course you can do that and shill it to these influencers, but not sustainable in the long term. And as Noah said, yeah, like the vast majority of them won't stick around. Sure, some will, you'll get some good people out of it, of course, but overall. Probably get more people shilling shitcoins.

[36:02] **qx()**: OK, so one thing I've been thinking about lately that I'm sure you guys have been thinking about since inception here is how do we make the thing? Well, I guess it's a second, second ending question.

[36:13] **qx()**: With the Sigmanauts, how do we make traditional, you know, DeFi and gaming and things that are, you know, make good use of a chain and that has longevity? How do we make that sexy in a world today where Solana dips 20, 30 bucks in price in one day or whatever it was, you know, whatever percentage and all of a sudden everybody's like, oh, let's go to Cardano. And it's meme season in Cardano now. Let's move over there and start on, you know, it's like that picture of the mom holding the kid and another kid drowning and Solana's the drowning kid and Cardano is now the kid being held up kind of thing.

[36:52] **qx()**: So, you know, that's not healthy for an ecosystem. That's for sure. So how do we make the stuff that we do and we can do and what Ergo can provide for the world and all sorts of people, how do we make that sexy in a time where sexiness is, you know, what I just explained? And I think people that may help Ergo the best isn't the type that's going towards Solana at the moment.

[37:18] **glasgow**: It's more the kind of stuff that went to Bitcoin at GameStop. So it's kind of anti-authoritarian. People recognize it as a way to take back control. It's truly open. So I think that's a narrative that could lead to a lot of hype. Eventually, once there's a bit more stuff working, a bit more mature, people can use stuff that works first time.

[37:46] **glasgow**: Yeah, I think that's the kind of, that's the hype we want to attract.

[37:50] **qx()**: So essentially fighting against the systems that are built to give you a disadvantage, whereas Ergo, Bitcoin, those kind of things are built on the premise that you have your own control and you can, you know, most likely have clear assumptions of what's on the chain, what's, you know, who's holding on the chain and what you can do with it.

[38:09] **glasgow**: Yeah, I think with CBDCs coming into play and that will kind of make people a bit, because I've noticed a lot of people that are anti-crypto. As soon as you mention CBDCs, then we should have an open source alternative, at least. They kind of soften immediately. So I think once CBDCs come into play and you can go, well, the government's got this, they're deploying it, we should have an alternative. We don't really at the moment.

[38:41] **Noah**: Interesting. I'll say, I think part of the fundamental issue is that outside of Bitcoin and a few flash in the pan meme hype runs, proof of work is really not in fashion right now in general. And it's pretty stagnant as far as innovation on proof of work itself, I would say. And I think... On other chains, you know.

[39:13] **qx()**: On other chains.

[39:17] **Noah**: Yeah, no, I'm saying, like, big picture, proof of work as a whole. But I was just gonna say, like, I think Lithos really represents, like, the next frontier of proof of work. And it's been in the back of my brain since it was announced, the idea from qx(), I think, qx().

[39:44] **Noah**: Yeah. And it really takes proof of work to the next level to a point where I think it's kind of the best of both worlds where it provides more power to miners and it also introduces more DeFi capabilities for users.

[40:11] **Noah**: Whether it's sexy or not is a question of when it arrives on chain, but I think giving people the power and control, not having to rely on mining pools. I think that's a pretty attractive narrative for proof of work.

[40:32] **qx()**: I think that's extremely sexy. I think, you know, when we started the Sigmanauts mining pool, I said to the whole group, I was like, guys, you know, we may be a DAO, but at the end of the day, I'm running stratum and I'm managing payments. So you guys are fucked if I say otherwise. So the best we can do right now is I shared the server keys and the wallet keys with a couple other people in the mining pool. That's the best we can do. But when Lithos comes along and can really decentralize, you can still have kind of pooled efforts with decentralization there.

[41:01] **qx()**: I mean, I think that's, yeah, I think you're right. That's definitely a sexy thing that the Sigmanauts need to get on and start hammering down as the next evolution of a fully decentralized system.

[41:13] **Noah**: Yeah, I agree.

[41:15] **qx()**: All right, guys, any closing words for anybody? Do we want to invite anybody that's watching this to join the Sigmanauts or should we tell them fuck off?

[41:25] **glasgow**: Yeah, come on.

[41:28] **qx()**: So we have for a Sigmanauts candidate, guys, if you want to join the effort, anybody can become a Sigmanauts candidate. There's an application form on our website, sigmanauts.com that Rustin, our lovely Rustin will go through every once in a while and bring you in as a Sigmanauts candidate. Otherwise, if you're interested, just pop up in chat and say, hey, any Sigmanauts in here? I'd love to become a Sigmanauts candidate. I want to get started. We'll just bring you right into chat as long as you're not like Sahar or Railroad or somebody.

[41:59] **qx()**: You know, you kind of can't be too much of an asshole. We don't want you to have a negative impact on the Sigmanauts. You have to have some social awareness and some sort of social accountability there. So yeah, that's pretty much the only requirement there to be a Sigmanauts candidate.

[42:15] **qx()**: And then on top of that, after you are involved and you're pitching and you're doing stuff, you can help as little or as much as you want, but if you do help quite a bit and you want to take the next step to become a Sigmanauts, we put your DAO vote in. And thanks to Paideia, you automatically get a Sigmanauts token so you can stake it and then vote on things as well as form your own committees.

[42:35] **qx()**: You can come in and be like, you know, you Sigmanauts aren't doing enough for this thing. I want to start a committee and gather some people and do it and go from there. Like SisyphusPush, just recently, he was a Sigmanauts candidate around the time that I joined or maybe a little before. And he took a little break. It's not uncommon for people to take breaks. And he came back in full force and is like, guys, we got to do something about the, you know, the NFT scene, because he was very passionate about that.

[43:03] **qx()**: And sure enough, we spoke with Quokka, and learned that they were, you know, they had these smart contracts that they needed to work on, but they also had a kind of a beta front end. So we learned a bunch of things through there. We set up a vote and we funded a bunch of that raffle that they put up to support that.

[43:24] **qx()**: So that's a kind of change that Sigmanauts can push through the ecosystem. You just got to kind of have the drive and desire to be around a little bit to see it through.

[43:36] **qx()**: But I just want to say for you two, you guys have been out a long time and I have nothing but respect for both of you guys. It's tough for I think how long you guys have put up with this. I'm not saying it's a bad thing, but you know, you hear the same questions every, you know, every couple of weeks from different people. It does become tiring, I imagine. And but props to you guys for sticking to it. I think it shows the resilience.

[44:02] **Noah**: You're getting tired.

[44:05] **qx()**: Me? What are you talking about?

[44:09] **Noah**: No, I will say, you know, people should feel free to spend as little or as much time as they're able to. You don't want to burn yourself out being involved. Yeah, I've been kind of on the back burner for a bit now, and it's good to just, you know, take a break, reconnect with what you actually care about, why you're here, and then, you know, come back stronger.

[44:38] **qx()**: Totally agree. And I think that's the beauty of the decentralized system, right? Somebody else is there to pick up the slack when you put it down for a moment and they hold the spot for you to pick up the rope again when you come back. So it's really nice. Nobody's going to hate you for it. I mean, I like your don't get burnout advice, Noah. Meanwhile, it's 3 a.m. in glasgow's town.

[44:59] **Noah**: Let's wrap it up.

[45:01] **qx()**: All right, everybody. Thanks so much for watching. Happy birthday, Ergo. I sent Raro some money, 15 or 12 ERG. He was going to make a cake for us. So hopefully we see Raro's cake online. Thanks, everybody.

[45:16] **Noah**: Cheers, guys. Yeah.
