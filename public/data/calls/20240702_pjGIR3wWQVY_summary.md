# Ergoversary Summit 2024: The Sigmanauts History and Future

**Call Date:** July 2, 2024  
**Participants:** qx(), Noah, glasgow

## Executive Summary

This Ergoversary community call focused on the history, evolution, and future direction of the Sigmanauts, Ergo's community-driven DAO organization. The discussion featured three key contributors representing different eras of Sigmanauts involvement: glasgow (founding member and ongoing EF contributor), Noah (early member now on break), and qx() (later joiner who became heavily involved). The conversation covered the organic formation of the Sigmanauts from informal community organizing, the challenges of scaling a volunteer-driven organization, and strategic considerations for sustainable growth.

The participants explored how proof-of-work blockchains like Ergo naturally foster grassroots community initiatives due to lack of emissions-funded marketing, contrasting with proof-of-stake systems. They discussed the critical need for revenue generation to support dedicated contributors and the vision of spinning off specialized sub-DAOs for auditing, marketing, and other functions. The conversation also addressed current challenges including community drama during market downturns, the balance between price speculation and utility building, and strategies for onboarding the next 100 Sigmanauts while maintaining organizational cohesion.

## Key Discussion Points

• **Origins and Evolution**: Sigmanauts formed organically from existing community members who were already collaborating informally, with glasgow providing initial structure and Noah joining early on

• **Governance Challenges**: Early organization relied on tight-knit consensus without formal DAO tools; Paideia implementation has significantly improved decision-making processes with structured voting and treasury management

• **Revenue Strategy**: Critical need for sustainable funding through mining pool operations, app development (mgPai), potential Sky Harbor contracts, and UI fees to support dedicated contributors

• **Sub-DAO Vision**: Long-term goal to spin off specialized DAOs for auditing, marketing, and other functions that can generate revenue by providing services to ecosystem projects

• **Community Scaling Issues**: Growing pains from expanding membership (now ~100 total candidates and full members) including personality conflicts, language barriers, and misaligned expectations during market downturns

• **Proof-of-Work Dynamics**: PoW chains naturally foster community-driven initiatives due to lack of emissions funding, contrasting with PoS systems that can fund initiatives through staking rewards

• **Marketing Philosophy**: Debate over effectiveness of paying influencers versus building utility-driven adoption; preference for attracting users through functional applications rather than speculation

• **Future Technology**: Excitement around Lithos protocol as next evolution of proof-of-work that could provide more decentralized mining while enabling additional DeFi capabilities

## Decisions Made

• Continue pursuing revenue streams through mining pool, app development, and potential contract work to create sustainable funding for contributors

• Maintain current onboarding process where anyone can become a Sigmanauts candidate with minimal barriers, then prove themselves for full voting membership

• Focus on utility-building and anti-authoritarian narratives rather than speculative marketing to attract long-term committed community members

## Notable Quotes

**glasgow on original vision**: "The idea that me and Joe discussed in chat originally was to have multiple DAOs would spin off from it. So you'd maybe get a DAO that does audits and an ecosystem project could pay them a certain amount... And essentially you'd have those different DAOs for different things working autonomously."

**Noah on proof-of-work dynamics**: "I feel like that'd be a thing that usually... on proof of work blockchains, there tends to be more grassroots community initiatives because there's no emissions to pay for things like marketing... Whereas on proof of stake, a lot of the time, there's a foundation that can pay for that stuff."

**qx() on market psychology**: "When you said prices down, it really reminds me of that kind of ecosystem where the water is low, everybody, the resources are scarce, everybody's bumping into each other every two goddamn seconds, and it's pissing them off."
