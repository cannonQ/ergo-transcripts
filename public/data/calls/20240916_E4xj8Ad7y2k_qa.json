      "question": "How does storage rent work on Ergo and can developers steal funds through it?",
      "asker": "qx()",
      "answer": "Storage rent on Ergo charges approximately 0.14 ERG every four years on average, ranging from minimal amounts to 0.9 ERG depending on how much data is in the box. People are confused about trustlessness - any protocol-level changes require 90% super consensus and result in a hard fork, so miners wouldn't vote against their own interests. You can easily avoid storage rent by simply sending tokens to yourself, paying only a transaction fee.",

      "question": "What is the purpose of storage rent and how does it maintain Ergo's supply?",
      "asker": "implicit",
      "answer": "Storage rent ensures a stable and fixed supply while keeping the ledger and dust under control. Unlike Bitcoin where coins are lost forever, Ergo can reclaim unused tokens over time. This means there are no permanently lost coins - the same supply is maintained as storage rent returns unused tokens to circulation through miner rewards.",

      "asker": "implicit",
      "answer": "MewMart is an enhanced auction house where you can bundle multiple tokens, ERGs, and NFTs together and sell them as one package. It also functions as escrow - you can specify that only a particular address can purchase your bundle. This helps avoid liquidity issues and slippage that occur on DEXes when trading large amounts.",

      "question": "How do auction houses like MewMart help with liquidity issues compared to DEXes?",
      "asker": "implicit",
      "answer": "When you have a large amount of tokens to sell on DEXes, you might shift the price 10% due to slippage. The buyer faces the same issue when purchasing. Auction houses circumvent slippage on both ends - you list tokens at a fixed price and buyers pay that exact price, making it beneficial for both parties.",
