**Tweet 1:**
The USE stablecoin launch just made Ergo history 📊

395,000 ERG raised from 129 community members in what may be the largest community-driven launch in Ergo's history. This isn't just another stablecoin—it's a new model for fair, decentralized finance.

**Tweet 2:**
What makes USE different? It's 100% community-backed with zero VCs or team allocations. No "$1 for 70 cents" presales that plague other projects. Just honest price discovery and algorithmic stability mechanisms battle-tested through Dexy Gold.

**Tweet 3:**
The efficiency gains are massive: Uniswap v3 pools offer 20x efficiency for stablecoins. What takes $1M liquidity on standard AMM can be replicated with just $50K on v3. This changes everything for cross-chain expansion via @RosenBridge.

**Tweet 4:**
Speaking of cross-chain: First stop is Binance Smart Chain for cost-efficient USDT rails, then expanding to create arbitrage-friendly infrastructure across ecosystems. Every chain gets efficient stablecoin trading with minimal liquidity requirements.

**Tweet 5:**
Meanwhile, Lithos testnet is crushing it with competitive mining and the first successful fraud proof execution. Community participation is so high that @qx can't mine blocks with his 3090 anymore 😅

**Tweet 6:**
Rosen Bridge now supports Bitcoin Runes, enabling unique Bitcoin asset wrapping. Plus research papers accepted for India stability workshop (Dec 15), new Minotaur wallet version, and sub-blocks testnet launching soon.

**Tweet 7:**
This is what fair launch looks like: community-driven innovation, battle-tested tech, and real utility. No hype, just building the decentralized financial infrastructure the world needs.

- **Speaker:** Richie (USE Project Lead)
- **Context:** Historic community-driven stablecoin launch

- **Speaker:** Richie
- **Context:** Community activation and fair launch philosophy

**Quote 3:**
*"With Uniswap v3 type pools, you need $1 million worth of liquidity on standard AMM, but you can replicate the same efficiency with just $50,000 of liquidity—that's 20x efficiency."*
- **Speaker:** Richie
- **Context:** Liquidity efficiency and cross-chain expansion strategy

**Quote 4:**

- **Speaker:** Joe Armeanio
