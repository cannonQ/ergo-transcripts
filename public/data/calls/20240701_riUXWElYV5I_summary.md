# Ergo Community Call Summary

**Date:** July 1, 2024  
**Title:** Trade House | anon_real | Ergoversary Summit 2024

## Executive Summary

This community call featured a comprehensive presentation of Trade House, a new trustless order book DEX developed by anon_real and the auction house team. The platform addresses key limitations of AMM-based trading platforms like Spectrum, including high slippage, fixed pricing, and market volatility caused by large swaps. Trade House introduces partial order filling capabilities, trustless off-chain order matching, and competitive fee structures to the Ergo ecosystem.

The presentation demonstrated Trade House's core functionality, including wallet integration with Nautilus and Ergo Pay support, multiple trading pairs, and comprehensive order management features. The platform offers 50% lower fees compared to SigmaUSD Bank Box and provides users with better execution prices through its order book model, as evidenced by real examples showing users receiving more favorable prices than their original orders specified.

## Notable Quotes

> "AMM trading such as Spectrum suffer from several issues. Low liquidity causes high slippage which results in overpaying by the users. The price is fixed at any moment and the user has no options to put orders with different prices." - **anon_real**

> "All orders are protected by audited contracts and are executed on chain, no intermediary, no trust bottlenecks." - **anon_real**

> "Although not implemented yet, this could make Trade House the single needed hub for trading. As an example, a user could place an ERG sell order for $5 per ERG. As soon as some other order can match that, or a Spectrum LP box or SigmaUSD bank box can offer the same price, the order will be executed." - **anon_real**
