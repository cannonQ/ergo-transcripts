[00:15] **qx()**: Hello and welcome to the hundred and twenty fourth, maybe something like that.

[00:21] **qx()**: Dev update.

[00:22] **qx()**: We'll have to fact check me on that with me today.

[00:24] **qx()**: You can see the spiraling, beautiful visualization right here to my left.

[00:30] **qx()**: We have an audio guest joining us today.

[00:34] **qx()**: A very, very special guest.

[00:36] **qx()**: It is Mr. Pixel from Cyberverse.

[00:39] **qx()**: How you doing, Mr. Pixel?

[00:40] **qx()**: Thanks for joining us.

[00:41] **Pixel**: Hey, man.

[00:42] **Pixel**: Thanks for inviting me.

[00:44] **Pixel**: How are you doing?

[00:45] **qx()**: I'm doing all right.

[00:46] **qx()**: You can't see it from your end, but the music visualizes.

[00:50] **qx()**: It might be a little too trippy, but it's going to be cool.

[00:52] **qx()**: Every time you talk, it kind of spikes up, so it's neat.

[00:56] **qx()**: So I'm so happy to have you on the show.

[00:58] **qx()**: I've been asking you for maybe five years to have you on the show, Mr. Pixel.

[01:03] **qx()**: And finally got you to agree.

[01:06] **qx()**: It took like three poker tournaments, a couple things of whiskey and tequila.

[01:10] **qx()**: And then a lot of Cyberverse to get you on here. But I've got a lot of questions to ask you about Cyberverse, about your time in Ergo.

[01:20] **qx()**: So let's get started, sound good?

[01:26] **Pixel**: Yeah, yeah. All right, let's do it.

[01:32] **qx()**: So let's start from the beginning. Why Ergo? What got you into Ergo? Like give me the basics of - you're walking on the street and you saw like an E sticker somewhere and you're like, oh my gosh I want to build this game on Ergo. What are the origins of your creation here in Ergo?

[01:48] **Pixel**: I mean to be honest, I personally started a collection named Ergo Pixels because I saw Charles Hoskinson talking about it.

[02:02] **qx()**: And then you started an NFT thing, Ergo Pixels.

[02:09] **Pixel**: Yeah. Because during that time there was only Ergo Auctions.

[02:14] **qx()**: Right, right, right.

[02:15] **Pixel**: I was like, let's give it a shot maybe it's gonna be my hobby. Little did I know I just screwed myself over for a long time.

[02:32] **qx()**: Yeah.

[02:33] **Pixel**: So I tried and I saw it was actually very easy to mint the NFTs, also it was very cheap, and also the community was very, very welcoming.

[02:41] **Pixel**: So I just keep pushing, minting NFTs.

[02:46] **qx()**: So that was Ergo Pixels version one, right? They're just the flat images, pixel-based art.

[02:55] **Pixel**: Yeah, exactly. It was 24 by 24 pixels and I was auctioning them. And people loved them. So we made a collection and sold out within four days because I was sending them manually during the time.

[03:15] **qx()**: One transaction at a time.

[03:18] **qx()**: One transaction at a time.

[03:20] **Pixel**: Yeah, exactly.

[03:21] **qx()**: So wait, how many were there?

[03:24] **Pixel**: 250.

[03:26] **Pixel**: So it took me two days to mint them all and then four days to actually send them out.

[03:39] **qx()**: That's amazing. So you drew these version one Cyber Citizens, right?

[03:45] **Pixel**: Yeah, I drew them all by myself.

[03:49] **qx()**: So what app do you use to do that? What was your creation tool?

[03:52] **Pixel**: Well, it was some pixel editor. It was named Pixel Picks or something. It was a website.

[04:02] **qx()**: Oh, my goodness.

[04:03] **Pixel**: I just like the images. So I just drew 250 images within two weeks.

[04:09] **qx()**: Just one pixel at a time like MS Paint. You're drawing these things.

[04:15] **Pixel**: Yeah, exactly.

[04:16] **qx()**: Oh, my gosh. Holy cow, that's amazing. And those guys are still up on the auction house. You can still find some at SkyHarbor in the auction house, right?

[04:25] **Pixel**: Yeah. And now there's also CruxMart where you can lease them.

[04:30] **qx()**: CruxMart. I will say that I just bought a jackhammer. I saw the post that you reposted on Twitter and I went there and there was this jackhammer that I've been looking at and trying to buy for a long time. It was 15,000 CYPX and I was like, okay, that's cheap enough for me to just buy.

[04:55] **qx()**: And I went to the mines immediately after and was like, oh like nine seconds for most things, something like that, it's within seconds.

[05:04] **Pixel**: I don't really know about the specifics right now because we have a lot of things built.

[05:10] **qx()**: Yeah, you just walk into the mines and hit /mine diamonds and boom it just mines it for you right?

[05:18] **qx()**: All right, so you built these Cyber Citizens, this first version of Ergo Pixels, and what happened next?

[05:26] **Pixel**: I mean, people loved them, and I wanted to expand. So then we made Cyber Citizens Gen 2.

[05:38] **qx()**: And same kind of process. Those are flat 2D ones?

[05:42] **Pixel**: It took a bit longer because the first plan was just to do 250. But then I got an idea to create a game, Cyberverse.

[05:57] **qx()**: Would you just wake up at night after a dream?

[06:01] **Pixel**: No, no, no. It was an idea I had for a while, but I didn't have the skills and funds. So I just had an idea and I saw Ergo Pixels worked out perfectly, so I just gave it a shot. And for now, it's working.

[06:32] **qx()**: For now. So how did you go from - what you just explained was like how to draw a horse: you drew the stick figure and then there's this beautiful horse. So give me the meat in between. How did you go from "let's create Gen 2 Cyber Citizens" and then "let's make a game"? Who's involved with that? Who did you find to be able to do this coding? How involved was it? How involved are you in the creative process in total for that?

[07:03] **Pixel**: I mean, we got just a few people that I'm working with. For example, Hero. Hero is the important person in our team who's managing, who's working on the game. He's our game developer.

[07:18] **Pixel**: And then we have Hero, Neon, Breeze, who's working on blockchain stuff, like taking care of nodes that are sending rewards and crafting items and so on.

[07:35] **Pixel**: And then we have Mongo who's taking care of website, and artists and music composer and that's it.

[07:42] **qx()**: Mongo does art and music?

[07:46] **Pixel**: No, Mongo does website. And we got artist named Kohari and music composer named Mateo.

[07:58] **qx()**: Okay, that's right. That is one thing that drew me into Cyberverse when I first launched the game. Just this kind of - not ambient, but this music just slaps, but it's very calm and very engaging and very able to sit there in the background and give you that mood to the game. It's perfectly written for what that game is, the visual aspect of it. How did you luck out like that?

[08:29] **Pixel**: I don't know, but Mateo is just a really, really skillful person. I just told him, I just sent him references or just told him what I'm expecting for our next work. And he just created, he just does the magic.

[08:49] **qx()**: So what - well, let's sub-block off that music part. Cause I like that. So you also had THC Liquid compose a couple of specialty tracks for you, correct? For some sort of event.

[08:59] **qx()**: You had THC Liquid, right?

[09:01] **Pixel**: Oh, yeah. We integrated them as default songs to the game as a part of collaboration.

[09:11] **qx()**: And those are - are those actually keys to soundtracks in the game or can people listen to those soundtracks on IPFS as itself or are those actually recordings on IPFS link to, or they actually - I never bothered to look.

[09:30] **qx()**: So it's in the game only. And didn't I hear something - didn't I hear something that you were going to make a player that people could play through these songs themselves outside of the game or something like that?

[09:39] **Pixel**: Oh, no, no, no. We'll be publishing them on YouTube and Spotify.

[09:44] **qx()**: Oh, fantastic, fantastic. All right, so we've gotten as far as you've made Gen 1 pixels, you then made Gen 2, and then you had a eureka moment in the middle of the night and woke up and was like, I want to devote a lot of my time to painstakingly create this game.

[10:01] **qx()**: And you found a dev, you found music composer, another artist, website person. You found a couple people to help you out in this endeavor and move forward and now we have Cyberverse in all its beauty.

[10:17] **qx()**: And you just released something called on Twitter - I saw version three of the driving game, which is just amazing. So my question is how the hell do you guys have all this time? Is this like most of your full-time gigs or is this a side project for all you guys? Or are there some like where one person it is full-time and then the rest it's side? It just seems like you guys are constantly pumping out updates all the time.

[10:41] **qx()**: It's so fast that you sometimes don't put in a dev update and I have to try to mention it from what I can remember.

[10:50] **Pixel**: Yeah. I mean, all of us are part time. I recently have been focusing more on Cyberverse and I'm planning to do full time Cyberverse stuff. And also want to invite Hero, our game developer, to also do full-time in Cyberverse. We just need a bit more time for that.

[11:23] **qx()**: So your next step in all of this Cyberverse is to move cross-chain, right? You've already kind of allowed Cardano wallets to log in and do their stuff, but what's your step in more fully integrating other blockchains in that matter?

[11:41] **Pixel**: Okay, so before, let me make it clear because I saw some people in general have been concerned: We will stay on Cyberverse. We are not moving to another chain.

[11:52] **qx()**: People love the FUD like that, that's for sure.

[11:56] **Pixel**: There was one person, I think, or two persons. But we are staying on Cyberverse. We are just connecting other chains. And we recently connected to Cardano wallet. And we are also planning some NFT drops there so people can fully play from Cardano as well. And also plans to expand more to other chains, but things take time.

[12:27] **qx()**: Yeah, yeah, of course, of course. So you're going to utilize - tell me how you're going to leverage Rosen and how exactly that connection is going to look. Let's say Rosen finally bridges to Ethereum in a month or two or three months whenever they're going to do it. And I'm an Ethereum user and I hear about this crazy nostalgic game called Cyberverse and I want to play it. What's that going to look like for me and how I'm going to be able to - Where am I going to be able to own my NFTs? Where am I going to be able to - Am I going to use Rosen CYPX to buy things in-game? What's that scenario look like in those cross-chain events?

[13:03] **Pixel**: I mean, we'll be utilizing Rosen Bridge for our token.

[13:09] **qx()**: So Rosen CYPX will come over.

[13:13] **Pixel**: Yeah, exactly. So people can redeem those tokens from their blockchains. For example, if you are on Cardano, you can redeem Rosen CYPX and don't have to log in, connect Ergo wallet to redeem those tokens. So it will be about the token for Rosen Bridge.

[13:34] **qx()**: And what about, like, I just bought that jackhammer that sits in my Ergo wallet. How does that relationship work with bridged chains?

[13:43] **Pixel**: Well, if you create your account in Cyberverse from, for example, Cardano, you can link your Ergo wallet in settings and can hold those NFTs on Ergo and still use them in the game. But also we will have some, for example, those jackhammers, NFT items. They will be minted on different supported blockchains in Cyberverse.

[14:13] **qx()**: Gotcha, gotcha. So everything will be duped as far as what's available or what's possible on every single blockchain that you're connecting to as well.

[14:21] **Pixel**: Yeah. Not everything. For example, Cyber Citizens will stay on Ergo. But there was some talk about doing centralized bridge so you can bridge from Ergo to Cardano and from Cardano to Ergo, those citizens.

[14:41] **qx()**: I gotcha. Okay, very interesting. So mostly if people are going to want, at least early on, for the time being, if they want to own a citizen and create and get yield off those citizens for - what is it called? You activate them, right? In the daily rewards, they're going to have to purchase that and have an Ergo wallet on the Ergo blockchain.

[15:07] **Pixel**: Yeah.

[15:08] **qx()**: Very cool, very cool. Well, tell me this. Let's back up a little bit. Give me your inspiration for this kind of artwork, this kind of pixel-based artwork. I know you like doing that for designing that artwork, but is that something like you always liked those kind of 1980s movies or those kind of games like Leisure Suit Larry? When I first played I was like, holy shit this is a Leisure Suit Larry kind of thing from the late 80s or California Dreams and whatever those games were I played on the Apple IIe's with the color screen or whatever that version of that machine was that was green screen I think but same kind of idea. What was your inspiration for that?

[15:52] **Pixel**: I mean I've always been a fan of games. I'm a gamer and I just liked the theme, like late Miami vibes. Cyberverse reminds me of Vice City.

[16:20] **qx()**: Yeah, you enjoy playing Grand Theft Auto.

[16:24] **Pixel**: Yeah.

[16:25] **qx()**: Gotcha. Gotcha. Okay. So this is kind of a 2D or a top-down 2D, 3D representation. That's pretty neat. All right. So what are your plans? So far in Cyberverse, right, we have gambling, we have games such as - right, there's a jukebox game, there's the bar game, there's the driving game, there's a sheep and wolf multiplayer game too. There are a lot of games and activities. Did I miss anything? Keep going, keep going. What did I miss?

[16:58] **Pixel**: Well, we got gardening, we got mining, we got fishing, we got apartments that you can own and customize, and also have mining rigs to mine CYPX, and also furnaces, and a lot of stuff. Like, there is plenty of things you can do in Cyberverse. And a lot of things are planned.

[17:19] **qx()**: So right now for multiplayer, we have the driving game and the sheep game, sheep and wolf. Anything else that you can say safely that you're planning to bring multiplayer to kind of get that more - more people on at once doing those kinds of things that bring people on and get them to stay?

[17:40] **Pixel**: Well, our next focus will be survival, like open world.

[17:46] **qx()**: Run that by me slowly. How's that look?

[17:49] **Pixel**: Well, there will be a lot of new items. You will be able to create items to kill mobs, to get another better items, explore bigger map. There will be a very big amount for survival.

[18:07] **qx()**: So bigger maps. So Cyber City will actually be a city on that map that you can go into the wilderness essentially and kill mobs, gather resources, build things. Holy cow. All right. Are you allowed to say how far away that is? Are you beta testing, alpha testing that at all?

[18:30] **qx()**: Okay, fair enough. All right. So based on that kind of thing, materials and building, I was playing it the other day and I thought to myself, OK, how do they sit down and come up with the idea that to make this jackhammer, it takes these eight parts to make some of the parts in that jackhammer, eight parts. It takes three parts to make one of those three parts that makes one part. How do you sit down and come up with those crafting recipes? Is there like a formula for that? Or are you and Hero just sitting down with an excel sheet with a flow chart and saying like this is how everything fits out? What was that process?

[19:09] **Pixel**: The crafting recipes are on me. That's why community hates me because I'm really bad in crafting recipes, but thanks to our community I always try to balance things, like improve them or change them.

[19:29] **Pixel**: For example, right now, there will be updates for crafting recipes for energy items and also for energy - stamina spent for recipes because some, well, not some, a lot of people complain about the crafting recipes takes - The items you can craft takes a lot of time and also takes a lot of energy - I mean stamina. So we're kind of doing a rebalancing there for that.

[20:08] **Pixel**: Yeah, exactly based on community members that suggested some of my crafting recipes.

[20:15] **Pixel**: Shout out to Kilver.

[20:17] **qx()**: Shout out to Kilver. Yeah, Kilver definitely needs a shout out. Kilver's a great representative of a player that's passionate about the game, streaming it. So if anybody can catch it, find Kilver's streams. Is he still streaming every Sunday, or has he backed off on that a little bit?

[20:32] **Pixel**: Oh, no, no, no. He doesn't have time for now.

[20:37] **qx()**: OK. But those are always fun to watch Kilver do that, that's for sure. OK. All right. Yes, it is funny those - what's it called? I'll be thinking I was trying to build a mining rig recently Recipe and I was like this is gonna take me a fucking month.

[21:00] **qx()**: Maybe more, it was pretty intense, but I started it and then I end up buying a couple parts here, but that's the thing too. Sometimes it's hard to find a part for something because it's so hard to make and somebody who makes it it's like I'm using it for myself.

[21:17] **Pixel**: I mean some items you can trade with other players because we also have a trade feature where you can trade items for other items or CYPX with other players.

[21:34] **qx()**: Can you talk about that? Can you tell me how much - right? There's quite a bit of volume going through the internal auction house inside Cyberverse, right?

[21:43] **Pixel**: Oh, do you mean community marketplace?

[21:45] **qx()**: Yeah. Community market.

[21:47] **Pixel**: Yeah. Well, we have a community marketplace where you can list items, in-game items and other players can buy them. And there is also trade feature where you can trade with other player in person.

[22:04] **qx()**: Right. You can walk up to somebody just like the old Diablo 1 days. You can trade.

[22:09] **qx()**: Yeah, that is pretty neat. So what's it called? And you also have some - you've introduced something to the actual like the guy that takes you mining in the mines. You can sell things to him or the fisherman. You can sell things to him based on - that's a rotating thing that you added recently to help offload kind of supplies instead of the marketplace.

[22:33] **Pixel**: Well, we got also merchant NPCs. Like you said, the guy who moves you to cave island. And also in gardening, there is also merchant NPC. And each merchant has its own niche. For example, in gardening, you can trade with NPC gardening items. And in cave, you can trade ores, I mean, ingots, sticks and such stuff. And we also have a sketchy dealer that spawns randomly around the map.

[23:16] **qx()**: I haven't dared deal with sketchy dealer yet. I have not dared touch him. Does he - so if you offer, how does that work? If you offer some items to him, he'll give you some lower value for them. But then there's also a chance he'll steal one of those items from you.

[23:31] **Pixel**: There is also a chance to scam you. But the difference between sketchy dealer and merchants is that with the sketchy dealer, you can sell unlimited items. And with merchants there are deals that regenerate every few hours.

[23:52] **qx()**: Whose idea was sketchy dealer?

[24:00] **Pixel**: Well, I think it was community ideas.

[24:04] **qx()**: Is that a big thing in Cyberverse? Is that a big thing where you really take guidance from the community about what comes up next or what you're building? How do you take that feedback? And how do you take it in a constructive way that doesn't ruin what you've made? Because there's nothing that can ruin something quicker than listening to community members sometimes. So how do you filter that out? How do you recognize what's just somebody bitching or a pain point that is really beneficial and filter that out from something that is like wow, that's a great idea or yeah, I like that idea but we can try it this way instead. How do you deal with that? How do you manage that?

[24:44] **Pixel**: Well, we take community's feedback very serious. For example, the sketchy dealer was added after we published update with decreased item prices.

[25:03] **Pixel**: There was also the deals.

[25:05] **qx()**: It decreased daily rewards, too. That was the same update with the daily rewards reduction. That probably wasn't very popular, was it?

[25:11] **Pixel**: Yeah, exactly. The community was a bit disappointed because they weren't earning as much as before. And it was a bit of a shock for them. And the problem was people shared with us that the deals, the merchant deals that were also added during the time, before the sketchy dealer was added, that the feature is very restricted because they couldn't sell infinite items to the NPC. So we heard them and we added a sketchy dealer where you can sell unlimited items. But there is a chance you get scammed and also there is a bit reduced price compared to normal price of the items, right?

[26:10] **qx()**: Right. And do you have visible stats of that? It'd be funny to see what the overall volume is with sketchy dealers so you can see the underground economy.

[26:21] **Pixel**: Oh, we don't have that. That's the secret of sketchy dealer. He doesn't share his secrets.

[26:29] **qx()**: Alright, so what I hear that I'm really excited about is you're moving to a bigger world with crafting of weapons as well. Gosh, now I'm not going to be able to sleep at night. That sounds like a lot of fun, damn. But that sounds like a lot of freaking work. Are you guys just testing? What if somebody wants to come to you and say, you know, I have 30 hours a day that I play Cyberverse. I'd love to help you test these alpha features. I'll sign an NDA and whatever. Do you have a need for that kind of thing? Or do you just test amongst yourselves the best you can and then release to kind of a beta from there?

[27:14] **Pixel**: Well, majority of updates are tested by team, by the team. But some updates, for example, multiplayer, mini games or something like that are tested with OG, OG players. Because I trust those people.

[27:31] **qx()**: I don't blame that. I don't blame that. Not at all. Okay. All right. Anything else you want to say about Cyberverse? Where can people find it? Is there a good landing page you want people to go to first? Like I saw you had the Cyberverse Wikipedia up. That was pretty neat. Or is there your main website, where do you suggest people go to first if they've never tried Cyberverse or are interested in it?

[27:52] **Pixel**: Well, cyberverse.wiki. There is a lot of information and was created by Lexi, who's also a community member.

[28:02] **qx()**: Lexi is the one that beat you guys in the race that you had as a demo up on your post today, isn't it?

[28:08] **qx()**: Lexi got first in the car race version three demo that you put up today on the video.

[28:15] **Pixel**: Oh, I don't know that it was - I was editing the video, but I don't know.

[28:28] **qx()**: All right. Awesome. Anything else you want to add before we switch over to the dev update reading? I'm really happy to have you on here. I mean if that's your punishment, Mr. Pixel, that if you don't have enough time to do text dev updates every week for your game, then I'm just gonna have to snag you on here every so often so you can make up for it. That sound like a deal?

[28:51] **qx()**: Don't do this to me. No, no, this is fantastic sir. All right, anything you want to leave us with before we jump into the reading.

[29:02] **Pixel**: I mean, I don't know play Cyberverse and wait for a bull market. And you can get Cyberverse at CruxFinance, Spectrum, SkyHarbor or ever auction house for any of the NFTs and if anybody's watching you want to try it out I've got several Cyber Citizens that I'm happy to lend you I think I lent some guy on Twitter two Cyber Citizens a couple months ago I think he's still playing I hope he is I haven't checked to see if they went to auction house or not, but I think he wanted one for one of his kids and him but yeah, so

[29:42] **qx()**: So, yeah, feel free to ping me too if you just want to test it out. But also, right, you have a feature where you can jump on without a Cyber citizen and have kind of a limited playing experience.

[29:51] **Pixel**: Yeah, I mean, it's free to play. You can play only with default characters, so you don't need Cyber citizen. But if you have one, you get better benefits in learning and such things.

[30:04] **qx()**: So you save in your internal database the character that is bound to their wallet, even though they don't have an NFT kind of thing? Or do you send them an NFT when they first connect if they don't have one?

[30:14] **Pixel**: Well, I mean, I was talking about the free-to-play that there is a default. You don't need any NFT.

[30:21] **qx()**: Right, right, right. But that free-to-play character can actually level, and there's no restrictions on how they level, or?

[30:26] **Pixel**: You cannot level that one. You need NFT to level up. And also, to accumulate rewards at the bank.

[30:36] **qx()**: Okay. That makes sense. That makes sense. You got to. Yeah. Perfect. So if you want to just test it out and poke around and push the buttons and pull the levers, then hop on with just a Cardano or Ergo wallet and you'll be given this demo character essentially. And if you like it, hop onto SkyHarbor or Ergo auctions or CruxMart and grab an NFT that you can start leveling. Super cool. I know I enjoy Cyberverse a lot. I think it's a great opportunity of a project on Ergo that ferociously builds all the time to have a big reach out outreach to other crypto chains and communities to bring people into Ergo kind of thing. So I applaud you for that, Mr. Pixel.

[31:20] **Pixel**: I mean, I'm happy you enjoy it.

[31:23] **qx()**: All right, let's move on to the dev update reading here. You got this, Mr. Pixel. You got this. Perfect. This is a punishment part of the call.

[31:39] **qx()**: All right, I'll start off. So we have AnonBR with Nautilus Wallet. They released version 0.11.0, they fixed an Ergo connector method, and added isAuthorized method. Ergo ledger.js released version 0.1.15, they increased unit test coverage, now is 100% covered, refactored all the code base, EIP12 types released version 0.1.11, added Ergo connector isAuthorized types, fixed Ergo sign date types.

[32:09] **qx()**: I can take kushti if you want to, because that's a long one, Mr. Pixel. So let me do that, and then you'll warm up into Spectrum Pool.

[32:17] **qx()**: So kushti says, Ergo Protocol and Reference Client R&D. He finished Sigma State Interpreter. There's a poll there. He did another poll, 10.15, and another 10.16 poll for Sigma 6.0. Now working on the Sigma State Interpreter 0.06 implementation. Let's see and a bunch of other polls there and they can start activation code with polish PRs done. There is need to finish unsigned begins implementation also checking the last things against bulletproofs range proof verification and bulletproofs. If you are not familiar with it, I believe there was an ErgoHack video if you guys want to watch that. Still working on Pull 2167 with Fanta now checking ordering issues reported by FlyingPig. Seems in memory cache is not sorted. Thanks for testing.

[33:05] **qx()**: Discussing variable difficulty setting with Dionysis for implementing better fork tracing rule. From this year. Oh, this is the Poem - I believe right - Poem proof of something. So I can't remember the em, but that was a pretty neat video I suggest you guys watch that if you guys have time. Checking papers again for faster confirmations and p2p improvements as after getting done. Last 6.0 PR as a plan is to get back to sub-blocks design and implementation. Yay for sub-blocks. Lots of people asked for that. Dexy still discussing bootstrapping with code for us and Dimitri. Hopefully LP will be launched this week. Fantastic other matters sigma trees video YouTube is right there. That was kushti's anniversary video and slowly writing our first forum post on Ergo specific change side chaining constructions. All right. All right, you've got Spectrum Pool right here, sir.

[34:00] **Pixel**: It's all you. I'll try my best. All right, so Spectrum Pool. They deployed a proxy contract for mobile. Let's done. Contract is compiled for each user on the fly with dynamic transaction fee. By free deposit done, see demo. About 30% of deposit feature complete, remaining 70% are about visual representation of unconfirmed and confirmed transactions. Good job, Nautilus. The speed improvement is huge. There is also a video.

[34:35] **qx()**: Sir? I don't know what the fuck you were worried about, man. That was fantastic. I guess you're going to be there every week reading these because that was great. All right. Here we go. Luivatra with Paideia. Treasury consolidation test case. Long living contract, which is automatic UTXO refresh when contract updated or UTXO more than two years old. Off-chain code and test case. Fixed oversight and proposal allowing a vote to be cast after proposal end time but before proposal evaluation. Crux generalized X order backend to include multiple DEXes and created endpoint for including WebSocket for live updates. Let's see. Do we have? Yep, here we go. We've got Colletier with Comet. Looks like he's got a little update here for you. Are you a fan of Comet, Mr. Pixel?

[35:23] **Pixel**: Yeah, we also added Comet emote to the game.

[35:31] **qx()**: Yep. Yep. Yep.

[35:33] **Pixel**: Okay. So, should I just, okay. I totally missed this. Okay. Here it goes. I made a new front end for Autolycos since it didn't have any, it's not something fancy.

[35:49] **qx()**: It is actually fancy. It's nice, isn't it?

[35:51] **Pixel**: Yeah. I actually like it. He did a great job. He did also Comet update, staying true to our roadmap. Those past a few months, we have been completely lazy and didn't deliver anything at all.

[36:05] **qx()**: Yeah, but he's back on the bandwagon of wrecking people. So that's good. That means Comet's back at it. All right, Rosen Bridge, for Rosen they finished a scale test of sending a director broadcast lines messages 100 kilobytes over the network, started working on retry mechanism for failed messages, started working on fixing dial issues and burst messaging scenarios.

[36:29] **qx()**: Rosen UI asset calculators save bridge token IDs inside bridge assets table. For the Rosen app provides a logic of the x-verse wallet, removed redundant logic for duplicate constants and utilities. Develop experimental error handling utilities for server actions, implement variation for P2WPKH PKH and P2WSH Bitcoin addresses right here for Rosen Bridge.

[36:53] **qx()**: Let's see, do we have anything else? Up here he released a Nautilus version 12 during the update day. Are we four? I think that's it. I think you got it easy with an easy update. You know what that means though? That means you need to give us a Cyberverse weekly developer update. Go ahead. Tell us what you did this week.

[37:23] **Pixel**: So no, wait, one sec. One sec. I mean do you really want to hear all the details?

[37:35] **qx()**: I do. Let's see what you did this week.

[37:41] **Pixel**: OK, let me try to make an overview.

[37:47] **qx()**: Perfect. Give me the reader's digest version. Yep, hit it.

[37:50] **Pixel**: OK, so we added the cyber racing in the game, multiplayer, where you can play up to 20 participants. And if only a few players are playing, then the rest of 20 people will be AI bots. And we also added single player mode. We also added advanced cars price. Both multiplayer and single player modes share the same features. We also added break function, where you can just hold space and break.

[38:38] **qx()**: Like, you can tailwhip kind of thing? Slide turn?

[38:42] **Pixel**: No, no, no. We are not advanced yet.

[38:44] **qx()**: All right, so just kind of slow down before you hit a puddle or an oil slick or a curve.

[38:51] **Pixel**: Yeah. OK. Well, basically, you just slow down the car. That's it.

[38:57] **qx()**: Usually, I slow down the car by running off the side of the track, but it's not on purpose.

[39:06] **Pixel**: Okay, so we also added minimap, also added spectator mode, also sense of speed, and join game UI and menu. Also, there are car tiers, where it's divided to car tier, car tier one, where there are slower cars and there is also tier two, there are cars a bit faster, so the races are a bit more fair.

[39:40] **qx()**: Oh, so if Kilver enters a race with that rare car that he has, he can't enter the same race that I'm in with that car? Or how does that work?

[39:49] **Pixel**: Yeah, so basically, if you have tier two car, you can only race with tier two cars.

[39:55] **qx()**: Ah, nice.

[39:55] **Pixel**: OK. Because it wouldn't be fair at all.

[39:57] **qx()**: That's true. That's true. Yep.

[39:59] **Pixel**: We were actually testing with the community yesterday, the Tier 1 car, the very basic one you can rent, and it was very slow, so it wouldn't be fair at all. It was like a tractor.

[40:14] **Pixel**: Yeah, so that's... We also, the AI players use new drive technology. They cannot strategize as well as humans, giving you a better chance to win. AI replaces players who quit.

[40:31] **qx()**: Oh, no way. That's awesome.

[40:32] **Pixel**: If you're playing with, for example, player two, who's actually a human, and he suddenly left, he will become an AI, like a bot.

[40:43] **qx()**: Okay.

[40:43] **Pixel**: Very cool. And the bots cannot collect coins. Player names remain but turn gray when replaced by AI. Final score is based on the number of players at the start of the race, not the end. Players' final score depends on tier 1: 60-40 points based on place and rank and tier 2: 80-320 points based on place and rank.

[41:12] **qx()**: What happens if Kilver sets up 20 wallets and joins in 20 tabs and just starts the race and then finishes with one player kind of thing? Does he still get all the points for his one player if nobody even moves off the start line?

[41:29] **Pixel**: Well, there is not a much big difference.

[41:35] **qx()**: A big difference in what you mean if he guarantees him first, I mean, I'm just wondering if somebody has like the amount of NFTs and cars to pull that off. That'd be interesting race against yourself just to kind of farm coins at your own pace first place. Interesting.

[42:02] **Pixel**: Well. Damn, you got me now. You got me.

[42:05] **qx()**: I'm going to try this. I'm going to see what happens if I can join the race with a couple of different wallets, see what happens.

[42:13] **Pixel**: I mean, yeah, I don't know what to say, to be honest.

[42:17] **qx()**: No, no, no. Yeah, I was just wondering that so I was wondering if like you could because there's no real other place to - what's it called? Like farm stuff with multiple - there's no benefit in any of the other games to farm. I guess you could play sheep and wolf by yourself, right? And get a lot of points that way.

[42:44] **Pixel**: I mean, it's not like I said, there is not a big difference at the points. I mean you can play it but you will get kicked out because you can play only up to four accounts at the same time.

[42:52] **qx()**: Gotcha. Gotcha. Okay. Okay. Cool. Cool. Cool.

[42:56] **Pixel**: So there are a lot of security things that only game developer understands. So that's why I don't know what to say about this question you asked me before. So I leave these things on Hero.

[43:12] **qx()**: Perfect. Maybe Hero can tell me why it's a bad idea in chats. Okay, great. What else and is that all you had for the week?

[43:23] **Pixel**: That's a pretty big list there. Yeah, I mean this kind of overview of the update.

[43:32] **qx()**: All right, sir. Well, I thank you so much for joining us today and yes, I'm glad that you're on Ergo. I'm glad that you're sticking with Ergo. I'm glad that you are developing something that I feel good about projecting out there and trying to bring people in to use it. I enjoy playing it. I never have much time to game. When I was younger I played some Diablo 2 quite a bit in my life.

[44:01] **qx()**: And that was about it. And then I played a little World of Warcraft for maybe a year or so. And then I started a family and then just felt guilty about playing. But Cyberverse is definitely a game that I can jump into at any time, go check my daily rewards, maybe go fishing, definitely use my new jackhammer to mine and make into bricks. And then if I catch you guys on the weekend, sometimes I'll jump into the wolf and sheep game, which is fun too. So it's that kind of game that you can jump in for an hour a week. You can jump in here and there kind of thing. It's not one of those. Or you can be like Kilver and just go crazy and have many different cars and NFTs and mine all of them and level all of them. So it kind of has that advantage of having that spectrum of different types of users that can get enjoyment out of your game. You don't have to be a whale or somebody that's just constantly there playing. You can still get a ton of enjoyment by popping in when you can and doing what you can.

[45:10] **Pixel**: Yeah, I mean, the game is for different kind of people. You can like you said you can play like 20 or 60 minutes or also grind all day. But it also depends of your energy in the character. You need to charge or just wait to be charged the energy.

[45:38] **qx()**: But of course it'd be nice to - what's it called? The one thing that really upset me in like mobile games and you play is the required - it's a free to play game, but the required. Oh, you ran out of steam, so you need to buy five diamonds to be able to get to win.

[46:00] **Pixel**: You can wait to be to recharge your energy or also craft items to recharge the energy. Yeah, so you can craft like coffee, coffee will give you energy. We plan to make it even easier to craft these things because right now it requires a lot of energy to even just craft the energy items. So yeah.

[46:21] **qx()**: Yeah, it's a net negative.

[46:24] **Pixel**: Yeah, that's when Pixel is working on crafting recipes.

[46:32] **qx()**: It's 10 energy to craft a 5 energy coffee. Perfect. Sounds about right, sir.

[46:37] **Pixel**: I mean, there will be changes in the coming update. So I hope there will be successful and it will be working completely fine because those new changes are suggested by community member.

[46:55] **qx()**: Awesome. Awesome. Well, I look forward to what you have out. Hopefully we see a text dev update from you next week. Maybe maybe maybe that could be Hero's job. If Hero has five minutes of time can pop up a text update on there.

[47:13] **Pixel**: I'm trying my best to actually publish the update but it's not always work as I imagine.

[47:29] **qx()**: No, no, it's good. It's good, sir. All right, man. Thanks so much for joining. I hope to see everybody around Cyberverse. I'm in the game with my ID. Mr. Pixel's in the game. I believe you're mr pixel in the game as well. So you're easy to spot if you're walking around there.

[47:44] **Pixel**: Thanks for inviting me.

[47:48] **qx()**: Thanks everybody. Bye.

[47:49] **Pixel**: Bye.
