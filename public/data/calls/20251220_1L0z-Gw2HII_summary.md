# Ergo PoW Blockchain - LATE NIGHT AMA - HAPPY HOLIDAYS!
**Date:** 2025-12-20

## Executive Summary
This was a late-night casual AMA featuring Joseph Armeanio  (armeanio), qx(), and Luca discussing Ergo development progress, philosophical views on decentralization, and current projects. The conversation covered infrastructure work, Lithos mining protocol, Gluon Dollar stablecoin development, and broader cryptocurrency philosophy around censorship resistance and peer-to-peer systems.

## Key Topics Discussed
- **Infrastructure Development**: qx() discussed moving Ergo infrastructure away from centralized services like Hetzner and Cloudflare
- **Lithos Mining Protocol**: Detailed discussion of on-chain mining pools to enable individual block production
- **Gluon Dollar Progress**: Luca provided updates on the stablecoin project, including contract audits and needed improvements
- **India Hackathon Experience**: Luca shared his challenging trip to India for the blockchain hackathon and workshop
- **Censorship Resistance**: Philosophical discussion about the importance of truly decentralized DeFi vs "parent-child" systems
- **Mining Decentralization**: How GPU mining could become more decentralized with excess AI datacenter capacity
- **Proof of Work vs Proof of Stake**: Debate about stablecoin implementations across different consensus mechanisms
- **Corporate Value Extraction**: Criticism of subscription software models and nickel-and-dime business practices

## Notable Announcements or Decisions
- **Gluon Dollar Updates**: Luca is working on contract improvements based on AI audit findings and reserve ratio adjustments
- **2026 Ergo Meetup**: Discussion of hosting the next meetup in Ithaca, NY at Cornell with a full conference format
- **Lithos Development**: Continued focus on enabling individual miners to build their own blocks on-chain

## Technical Concepts Explained
- **Lithos Mining**: System designed to put everything on-chain so individual miners can build their own blocks instead of relying on mining pools
- **Gluon Dollar Mechanics**: Detailed explanation of fusion ratios, reserve ratios, and normalized reserve ratios in the stablecoin protocol
- **Storage Rent (Demurrage)**: Discussion of how Ergo's storage rent creates predictable supply and enables DeFi operators
- **Autolykos Mining**: Brief mention of Ergo's ASIC-resistant mining algorithm originally designed to resist pool centralization

## Action Items or Follow-ups Mentioned
- Luca to share Dexy presentation slides in Telegram channel
- Luca to update Gluon Dollar contracts based on audit findings
- Luca to coordinate with Keith from Rosen on backend code changes for Gluon
- Potential silver oracle development mentioned by armeanio
- Bruno has video recordings of Luca's India presentations on his phone
