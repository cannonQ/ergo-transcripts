# Ergo Community Call Summary - January 24, 2025

## Executive Summary

This was Part 2 of Ergo's weekly community AMA, featuring core developer kushti (Alex), community manager Dan Friedman, and community member qx(). The call focused heavily on Ergo's technical development progress, positioning within the cryptocurrency space, and future organizational structure. kushti provided significant updates on sub-blocks development, the upcoming 6.0 protocol upgrade audit status, and proposed major changes to the Ergodevs DAO structure.

A major theme was Ergo's evolution toward becoming "global ultra-fixed neutral money" - a stable protocol foundation similar to Bitcoin's conservative approach, but with enhanced capabilities for building various forms of money and financial applications on top. The discussion also covered Ergo's advantages over Bitcoin in smart contract capabilities and the fundamental differences between Ergo's UTXO-based approach versus Ethereum's account model.

## Key Discussion Points

• **Sub-blocks Development Progress**: kushti successfully deployed a local miner-based DevNet generating sub-blocks with proper transaction commitments, with APIs for application developers coming within days

• **Protocol 6.0 Audit Status**: Only one small issue remains before public testnet deployment and mining pool outreach for activation planning

• **DAO Restructuring Proposal**: kushti proposed converting Ergodevs DAO to a temporary "2025" DAO with specific goals, then completely dissolving and restarting in 2026 with new members

• **Developer Bounties**: Over 27,000 ERG available in bounties across multiple projects and repositories, denominated in various tokens (ERG, Gluon, RSN, GORT)

• **Ergo's Positioning**: Emphasis on Ergo as "Bitcoin 1.0" - a complete, stable protocol enabling programmable money rather than general-purpose computing

• **Commodity-Backed Stablecoins**: Discussion of tokenized real-world assets including lithium-backed stablecoins in development with tokenomics partners

• **Educational Implementation**: qx() successfully introduced Cornell BRICK token system to 300-400 architecture students for plotting credits

• **P2P Financial Systems**: Exploration of off-chain payment protocols similar to Bitcoin's ARK, with potential for programmable off-chain contracts

## Decisions Made

• Ergodevs DAO restructuring discussions to continue with concrete 2025 goals and funding targets
• Sub-blocks API development to be prioritized before peer-to-peer network optimizations
• Town hall meetings to be organized for better community coordination and positioning discussions
• Cornell BRICK implementation to proceed with Tipperbot integration and student tutorial videos

## Notable Quotes

**kushti**: "At this point Ergo is already like Bitcoin back in 2012-14 right so quite established protocol right maybe still experiencing some developments like what happened with Bitcoin SegWit Taproot."

**kushti**: "The idea basically is to have a protocol which is not touched a lot right and then which can be evolved by building on top of it right so without application developers having fear that's you know the core protocol would break everything."

**Dan Friedman**: "Legacy financial markets aren't just built on the stock market and the bond market, but they're also built on commodity market by a huge, huge part... if we are going to be kind of the antithesis of that market by doing it in a decentralized way, we still need to maintain some of the same basic principles."
