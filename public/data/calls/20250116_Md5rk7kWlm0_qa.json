There's one more issue to fix, then we can release another 6.0 release candidate with testnet activation details. Testnet activation could happen soon due to custom soft fork parameters, with mainnet activation potentially starting around March after audit completion.",

      "answer": "Off-chain bots are needed to process transactions through complex smart contracts like DEX transactions, NFT marketplace transactions, and DuckPools. They're specific to UTXO blockchains and require significant time, effort, and research to develop, which makes development slower compared to EVM chains that don't need them.",

      "asker": "implicit",
      "answer": "There's no standardization of off-chain bots on Ergo (and Cardano). Developers have to build everything from scratch with everyone using different approaches - DuckPools uses Python with node API, Spectrum has complex heavy codebase, and each project implements their own way, creating inefficiency.",
