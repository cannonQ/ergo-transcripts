[00:23] **qx()**: Good morning.
[00:24] **qx()**: Happy AMA on August 29th.
[00:27] **qx()**: How are you doing, kushti?
[00:29] **kushti**: I'm doing well.
[00:30] **kushti**: Hello everyone.
[00:31] **kushti**: So no video today, sorry.
[00:35] **qx()**: You guys have to stare at my ugly mug the entire time.
[00:38] **qx()**: Well, at least you got a nice picture of kushti over there.

[00:43] **qx()**: Yeah. kushti, what's new? How's it going? How's Node 6, DevNet, all that kind of stuff?

[00:52] **kushti**: Yeah, so a lot of things going on currently. I released the first alpha release of Node 6.0 for local deployments only. And yeah, so that was asked by qx() to work on Lithos with it.

[01:21] **kushti**: Then, yeah, so continuing to work on 6.0 features to deliver the next release. Let's see. So it now depends on previewing mostly. But yeah, maybe even around the end of the next week, there will be another release and then third one. It would be more or less about these candidates.

[01:53] **kushti**: Then working slowly but surely on sub-blocks implementation. Then a lot of things going on Banxa, so now we have three people running servers and we are passing the nodes. Actually me, so they even collateralized, really collateralized now and so we are now considering what to do. So how can we build well chains of economic activity view of arbitrage means and I think well it's now ready for deployment and then after that other mainnet Banxa actions could be deployed so well we are continuing soft launch here.

[03:04] **kushti**: Alright, so a lot of things going on.

[03:08] **qx()**: As usual, yeah. And Sigmanauts, where I'm moving forward with the mining, reduce the huge threshold there is between profitability. As I said, my servers cost about $100 a month. And we're going to a different server infrastructure that's about $18 a month. So huge difference there. Hopefully, it'll allow the Sigmanauts mining pool to become profitable at that point.

[03:38] **qx()**: The vote that I did in the Sigmanauts to buy 300 ERGs worth of tokens have run out as well. So for those that weren't following the Twitter account, qx() has successfully integrated some code into Mining Core on the test server in the Sigmanauts mining pool, see if we can win some blocks. I mean, that's the tricky part, right? You have to win the blocks to actually get the storage rent.

[04:02] **qx()**: So if you're trying to test with only five pool, and we'll decommission the old pool, and we'll be the first pool that's running officially storage rent and collection on that. Looking forward to that.

[04:17] **qx()**: What else has happened? Sigmanauts are dealing with some sort of, oh, my light, love it. Sigmanauts are dealing, not dealing, but we're trying to manage some growing pains in the kind of social moderation scene in our chats. And I'll talk slower then.

[04:38] **qx()**: and enforce those. So essentially, you know, have some community standards that we can point to and say, look, you know, in order to be in this chat and be part of this group, you need to abide by these written community standards that are agreed upon by everybody. And if you can't, then you can't.

[04:56] **qx()**: So it's unfortunate that we have to do that. It would be lovely to have people who could practice congenial discourse or proper discourse without having to essentially police it. But it is what it is and that's going to happen as a group gets larger and larger. So it's good to have those in place from there.

[05:23] **qx()**: Let's see, I think that's about it. It's kind of been a slow week on the Sigmanauts front because we've been really focusing on community standards from there, but that's it. Let's see, you got anything else, kushti, or should we jump right to questions and have a full AMA side of it?

[05:46] **kushti**: Oh, sorry. Mike was off. So I guess there are other news, but I don't know. A lot of wild guesses, but yeah, we don't quite know.

[05:57] **qx()**: There's nothing in my communications channel in the Rosen gardens. So they're poking probably. Who knows? Maybe it was a slip of the finger, but I don't know. Yeah, we'll see. We'll ping them.

[06:14] **qx()**: to write that code. So what benefit will that have? Will that have more benefit for just more than Ergo? Will that be able to be utilized in the protocol level if the one threads change as well? Or is it just beneficial?

[06:28] **kushti**: Yeah, I don't know much about details, to be honest. But yeah, well, as far as I know, so well, stability, nexus rewards, you'll be distributed among those token holders.

[06:45] **qx()**: And we have 60, it looks like there's 631 ERGs, don't eat it away. So these kinds of things are important guys. If you have the ERGs to spare, do it. One thing that helps me that I can remind you guys of hopefully, is I know it's painful to donate sometimes your owners when it's below a dollar if you bought them higher than a dollar.

[07:06] **qx()**: So I tend to on these auctions. I tend to DCA in and use that right there to fund the auction mentally. It's a little bit of an easier sell for me because I'm getting a one-to-one deal with I'm taking my DCA, I'm taking 50 bucks from cash, putting it into ERG, putting it right into the auction. So I'm not like I'm taking an ERG that I bought at 250 and donate it to the auction at 75 cents.

[07:35] **qx()**: So mentally, 5G this week. So that's probably why you're seeing some video lagging on my part. But we're pushing forward with it. All right, we've got a question for you, kushti. Are you ready?

[07:52] **kushti**: Sorry, sorry. And yeah, so yeah, just reading.

[07:58] **qx()**: The question is from White Cat. Any plans for Ergo to expand in Russian markets since Russian government announced they will be more crypto friendly? Will there be any listings on Russian exchanges, et cetera? I guess the road map is if there's any for Ergo in Russia now that the legislation is changing or the mindset is changing.

[08:21] **kushti**: Yeah, I don't really know. But yeah, about those exchanges here, I have no idea yet. So the crypto scene in Russia is fully underground. It has been forever for that time kind of thing. I don't even know what's happening to be honest. I need to check some legal opinions. Well, on some of us, I'm close.

[08:58] **qx()**: So, yeah, I mean, the right with what has been happening, what has been going on and what a new account may be.

[09:05] **kushti**: Yeah, there won't be it wouldn't be so much development work for some time. So I think, yeah, let's see. So there are some thoughts. So what's going on there?

[09:24] **qx()**: It looks like HQx is building, what's it called? It looks like it's building kind of a trade house exchange. Oh, no, no, it's a video. It's a Twitter video. Holy cow. I think it's probably Andy's connection. It's tweeting out the AMA big time on Twitter. So I'm going to go shut it off for Twitter. So it stops doing that. Hang on one second.

[09:57] **qx()**: All right. You talk while I shut it shut off from Twitter now now, it's just the YouTube. So hopefully that'll stop pushing everybody. Thanks for letting us know And can you remove those tweets I sure can I sure can let me find another question to answer when I do that.

[10:16] **qx()**: All right Let's do

[10:23] **qx()**: Okay, here we go. Here's one for you that you can talk about, kushti. kushti, tell us about Morphic. What is his crypto story? He rarely speaks in public and yet he has done so much for Ergo like you. Do you think you can fill some people in on Morphic?

[10:53] **kushti**: But yeah, he also wasn't fond of, I don't know, public appearance. And yeah, the same is true for other developers like RA3. Wait, we heard a guy.

[11:15] **qx()**: Yeah, so... See it on the EF, if I'm not mistaken?

[11:21] **kushti**: Yeah, probably. But yeah, so Katya, for example, was before the EF and that guy and Green Head. I actually invited Green Head to the EF at some point, but yeah, he wasn't fond of doing that. And so, yeah, and Anon, BR is also, for example, he has a member, but not doing much public appearance.

[12:05] **qx()**: True, true, true. All right, so let's branch off that question, kushti, real quick. I mean, these guys obviously have concerns. Perhaps it's about, for different reasons, but when you see people like the French guy, or not French guy, the telegram guy getting arrested for those

[12:28] **qx()**: Your identity exposed here as a core dev of the Ergo ecosystem, where it's permissionless, anything can happen on it, and we're definitely not policing it. Do you sit back and think, is there any worry in your head about that kind of thing in the future?

[12:45] **kushti**: There are different aspects here. I think the most problematic thing is when you're running centralized service and allowing a lot of things there, like Telegram is doing, for example, and Tone, for example. So I think, well, in regards to cryptocurrencies, the most problematic is to run some centralized pseudo-blockchains. Well, in regards to Ergo, Ergo and so on, Monero, so well.

[13:26] **qx()**: permissionless.

[13:28] **qx()**: Yeah, that makes sense to me, but maybe not for lawmakers at some point.

[13:34] **kushti**: Yeah, then, you know, there are some jurisdictions, such as UK, for example, which tried to make developers so breached as well. There was some load draft, I don't know, was it passed or not. And then, yeah, it's a different story, right? So when developers can be breached for doing open source. But yeah, for most jurisdictions, that's not the case.

[14:06] **qx()**: very cool all right that makes sense all right let's get we've got a question here that i i know it's not going to end at once and for all but holy cow and so then so what's what's going on with the tweets oh i think you're good i fixed the tweets so

[14:24] **kushti**: Nice, nice.

[14:28] **qx()**: I think Andy's connection essentially is telling Restream that it's restarting the stream every minute. So a big proponent of asking this question. But they are very adamant about Dan's performance for Ergo. And then I'm not going to repeat what he said there. It's up on the screen. He's got some other questions in there repeating the same kind of thing.

[14:51] **qx()**: So these are easy to say when you're sitting on the sidelines and you're not doing much. You know, and you look at somebody who's an advisor to the EF and an advisor's role, the EF's role in that is to they take his advice or they don't take his advice. That's his role.

[15:10] **qx()**: So for any of you that have worked with Dan, whether on Palmyra, whether on Palmyra, whether in the AMAs, whether going to Vegas, I've been with them there for two years, you'd see that these kind of statements are, they just make me roll my eyes, absolutely. Absolutely crazy.

[15:28] **qx()**: Dan is a very hard worker. Dan's got Ergo on the front of his mind as well as other chains on the front of his mind. So if you're pissed that he's using cross-chain tech, I don't know what to tell you. The future of Ergo with Rosen kind of depends on cross-chain tech and Ergo being a place where other chains can come in and do things.

[15:52] **qx()**: So, those arguments are super silly to me. Dan, of course, it does bother Dan, I'm sure, to see these kinds of things, but he keeps on doing what he's doing, bringing Palmyra, Palmyra there with Winter Protocol Reminder built purely on Ergo.

[16:10] **qx()**: Yeah, so I don't have much to say about those kind of things other than if you guys were up here doing the stuff that Dan's doing, putting as much money as Dan's putting into his business to run it, which in turn helps bolster Ergo, I don't think you'd be saying this.

[16:31] **qx()**: You know, you keep on saying what you're saying. It's, you know, it's permissionless here on these chats and in the comments, but I don't know what to tell you. Obviously not going to change your mind because you've been hammering on that for a long time. So keep at it, but you're wrong. So that's about all I can say.

[16:52] **qx()**: All right, here we go, kushti. Sorry, go for it, kushti.

[16:58] **kushti**: So what's the point of the question?

[17:04] **qx()**: There's no point. I'm just addressing publicly that these kind of things. It's not even a question. It's just somebody that wants to continue to smash on it. And I figured I'd at least say something while I had the mic in front of my face, as opposed to a keyboard worrying.

[17:19] **qx()**: All right, kushti, we've got a question from Wombo22. Have you had time to look into Tailstorm? What are your thoughts on it if you have?

[17:27] **kushti**: Oh, Tailstorm, so still looking, but yeah, so in many aspects it's similar to, well, other proposals and what we do have. But yeah, so there are some differences, but mostly not applicable to Ergo, but still interesting, like modifying, incentivizing, incentivization, which we can

[18:01] **kushti**: do only in limited fashion, right, because there is no possibility to change block rewards, right, which may be a good thing, right. So, well, when it's not hard-coded in the protocol, it's actually very hard to change the emission, it seems.

[18:26] **kushti**: A very unique experience, I guess, that Ergo has here. Right, so even for such things as EIP-27, a lot of magic was involved and yeah, well, for doing incentivization like Tailstorm is proposing.

[18:52] **kushti**: There is need for hard form, but we are not going to fork hard. It's actually similar to what is already proposed.

[19:09] **kushti**: The problem is I'm now coding all the time and I need to finish 6.0 EIP at some point, propose it and then polish sub-blocks, EIP, documents publish it as an EIP, and so on.

[19:34] **kushti**: Right, so well, the main issue probably is to make all this stuff understandable and to get contributors involved. Yeah, so to really perform blockchain, right, which doesn't make sense.

[19:55] **kushti**: So recently I saw some tweets that some blockchain is doing 10 blocks per second. I don't see even a reason for that because all the blocks are empty basically, so containing all the miners rewards. But yeah, also I can't imagine how it's possible to do smart contracts and so on with 10 blocks a second, so yeah.

[20:29] **kushti**: There is need also to explain why things are done in a certain way and how the most realistic way actually when we are talking about real engineering. Especially when you get...

[20:54] **kushti**: But yeah, after his illness and death, so it's just me working on contracts currently. But then for backend, we have code for our USE and then that is working on UI. So, maybe it would be helpful to get alternative UIs and so on, right?

[21:17] **kushti**: So, what's Gluon is trying to do now, also with Gluon SDK. So, well, for UI, I guess, at some point, maybe soon after launch, there will be need for contributions or maybe alternative UIs.

[21:37] **qx()**: All right, cool. Cool. All right, let's see. We have a question from Womble 22 for qx(). Have you made any progress on your proposal? What I'm going to do is I'm going to go back to them and relay that to them and see if we can talk them down and perhaps see if we can get a bargain from either one of them. But I don't think we need to necessarily doing it.

[22:03] **qx()**: So we'll see what this, the one that I have, the price goes down. But there's also other stuff that happened that, well, I'm not going to say anymore, but yes, soon. So, okay. What else do we have?

[22:21] **qx()**: We have, all right. Luke Gray Smith says, all of the major tech corporations are buying up what amounts to high end GPUs that are going into data centers. If AI is unprofitable, what happens? What will do for AI?

[22:39] **kushti**: Oh, it is not that attractive. So I have to say actually, so maybe, yeah, some GPUs still reach mining space, but I'm not sure about that. So I believe, well, we are living in a world where, you know, well, generic CPUs are not enough for many computational tasks. So probably GPUs will be with us, not just for mining for a long time.

[23:21] **qx()**: Yeah, that's interesting. I don't see, at least from my point of view and where AI is in the academic world, I don't see AI going away. About partnering chains, I think they talked about Algorand partnering with them. Proven wants to know if there's any thoughts about providing something to the Cardano ecosystem from Ergo as a partner chain.

[23:50] **qx()**: You're muted, kushti.

[23:52] **kushti**: Yeah, but

[23:55] **kushti**: Actually, I think the question is not new.

[23:58] **qx()**: I've seen Charles tweet some things before to other chains that says, hey, if you guys could do this, we could do this. So this is definitely not new. This has happened before with these kind of tweets from Charles. So yeah, I mean, he even, right, he even pinged us about useful proof, proof of useful work. you know, switching to that kind of thing.

[24:15] **qx()**: So I don't know if I take this very seriously with those kind of tweets that he does, perhaps. Maybe not, but I don't know. I think already, I think Ergo was in a position where we don't need to necessarily partner officially with somebody, right? We have tooling. We have the bridge. We have things that people can come over easily and utilize our platform.

[24:39] **qx()**: So as far as partner chaining, like roll-ups on their chain, I don't know what that specific would mean. I think we're positioned already to be a partner with any chain that wants to utilize our platform with Rosen meeting that front. So yeah. To me, it's here. If you want to use it, then use it. But we don't need to think hands about something. That's just my take.

[25:02] **kushti**: Yeah, so technically it would be interesting to consider sidechain possibilities, right? For example doing some trustless cross-chain like trustless relays from Cardano to Ergo and vice versa.

[25:19] **qx()**: Right, didn't you do one for Bitcoin? You made a proof of thing for Bitcoin? Related to our chain or something with a relay?

[25:27] **kushti**: Yeah, but for

[25:31] **kushti**: For proof-of-stake blockchains and in particular Cardano, well trustless really would be a much more complex beast. So you cannot validate, I guess, its trades. But then, yeah, there could be some tricks to bypass.

[25:58] **kushti**: heavy validation rights, maybe using some zero-knowledge like bulletproofs, just as well as succinct verification mechanism. So, yeah, it would be interesting to explore something like that. But does it mean a partner chain does side-chaining?

[26:25] **qx()**: Yeah. I mean, what's that mean, right? Techniques.

[26:33] **qx()**: Let's see if we got anything else. It looks like Wombo had a question from last week before the internet died on us. And that would be kushti. What are the options you are discussing for the initial use? Oh, I want to know this too. I think we've talked about this before, but what's your initial use case for ChainCash?

[26:52] **kushti**: All right. Yeah, I mean, so this is kind of a generic tool, right? So I believe even previously I may have discussed that. So there could be different use case, right? But what I'm currently thinking about is what we are discussing with some guys probably are known to you as well, right?

[27:21] **kushti**: is to use it for community finance like trust-based community currencies.

[27:32] **qx()**: Right, if the Sigmanauts could provide a trust proof there and people might be apt to take on the note if they knew it was backed by a group like the Sigmanauts or even the DevDAO or something like that. So that's a really good use case.

[27:47] **kushti**: So we just need for service providers, good sellers, right? So maybe even I can sell something for LETS notes. But then, yeah, so there are other ideas. So, well, what we are discussing, well, with ChainCash contributors, even with paying developers with collateralized nodes, right?

[28:15] **kushti**: And then, for example, they can order something from some guys not far away with those nodes, right? or maybe buying services, well, merchandise or whatever. And then sellers can use those nodes further. Well, at some point they will redeem, but then, yeah, you know, so for the same amount of money, much more economic activity would be produced, right?

[28:53] **kushti**: So it's not just, I don't know, a developer getting ERG, for example, right, and holding it or selling. So this is about also producing as well economic activity for friends on the way as well.

[29:15] **qx()**: kushti, you can partially redeem these notes, right? So you can selectively remove collateral from it to cash it to redeem it and then continue to pass a note with whatever was modified there.

[29:27] **kushti**: So, yeah, you can split your node, for example, into two nodes, right, and redeem one and pass another. So, yeah, that's possible.

[29:39] **qx()**: Very cool. And how do you see real-world assets being integrated into ChainCash at all, tokenized real-world assets being there? I mean, there's no way to technically enforce it on chain unless you have a written contract coded in there with a title or something. How do you see that happening eventually?

[30:01] **kushti**: Right, so there is some trust point here, right, so convitability of real-world assets tokens. But then, yeah, so if you trust, well, provider of real-world tests, then, yeah, you can accept a node which is backed, right. But the same nodes can have multiple reserves behind, right, so, well,

[30:32] **kushti**: for example, you can back it with real world. I said the tokens, right. And pass to me. And then, if I trust those tokens, I can sign it, right. And it might be easier for me, but they can, they can, they can, sorry.

[30:52] **kushti**: sorry.

[30:53] **qx()**: we'll talk about Ergo,
