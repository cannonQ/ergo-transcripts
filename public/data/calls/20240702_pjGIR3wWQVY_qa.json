      "question": "How were the Sigmanauts conceptualized and why was this community group created?",
      "asker": "qx()",
      "answer": "The Sigmanauts came about because people were already organizing informally in chats and doing things together. After trying to speak with marketing firms that were too expensive, we realized we had a lot of great people in Ergo. The goal was to create structure to incentivize participation and help people jump straight in without getting stuck trying to figure out what they could do or how to get answers.",

      "question": "How did early Sigmanauts achieve consensus and coordination without DAO tools like Paideia?",
      "asker": "qx()",
      "answer": "It was more tight-knit with fewer but more active people who were generally like-minded. People just kind of did their own thing and it worked that way for a while. There were fewer conflicts because the group was smaller and more cohesive. The need for formal structures like Paideia became necessary later as the group grew and faced growing pains.",

      "question": "How has the Sigmanauts structure evolved from its early informal days to now?",
      "asker": "qx()",
      "answer": "In the beginning it was very loose - just taking an existing community and putting a label on it. It was a gradual process of creating incentive structures and weekly meetings for cohesion. Eventually we got a multi-sig wallet going, and now with Paideia it's night and day - we can actually have a DAO structure rather than just a Discord or Telegram group.",

      "question": "Why do proof-of-work blockchains tend to have more grassroots community initiatives compared to proof-of-stake?",
      "asker": "qx()",
      "answer": "On proof-of-work blockchains there tends to be more grassroots community initiatives because there's no emissions to pay for things like marketing. Whereas on proof-of-stake, foundations can often pay for that stuff because they have staking rewards - there's snowballing wealth that way. With proof-of-work it doesn't work that way, so things tend to be more community driven and bottom-up structured.",

      "asker": "qx()",
      "answer": "The idea would be to have multiple DAOs spin off from the Sigmanauts. You'd have a DAO that does audits where ecosystem projects pay them and they provide devs to do audits and issue badges. Essentially different DAOs for different tasks, ideally being funded through users and people that need those services, working autonomously. There could be audit DAOs, marketing DAOs, and others serving the ecosystem.",

      "question": "How would a Sigmanauts audit certification system work?",
      "asker": "qx()",
      "answer": "The idea was to have gold, silver and bronze certifications with a point system. Projects would come to the Sigmanauts and developers would review them. Points would be awarded based on factors like whether the team is doxxed, if smart contracts have been audited and by whom, where the code is hosted, and if it's open source. Each factor would contribute to different badge levels or add-on marks to indicate the project's credibility.",

      "asker": "qx()",
      "answer": "Lithos really represents the next frontier of proof-of-work by taking it to the next level as the best of both worlds. It provides more power to miners while also introducing more DeFi capabilities for users. It gives people power and control without having to rely on mining pools, which is a pretty attractive narrative for proof-of-work and addresses centralization concerns with traditional pool mining.",

      "answer": "Anyone can become a Sigmanauts candidate through the application form on sigmanauts.com, or by asking in chat. The main requirement is having social awareness and not being disruptive to the community. After being involved and contributing, you can become a full Sigmanauts member through a DAO vote on Paideia, which gives you a token to stake and vote on proposals, and allows you to form your own committees for initiatives you're passionate about.",
