# Ergo Blockchain Community Call Summary
**Date:** September 16, 2024  
**Title:** Dev Update Sept. 15th 2024 | Satergo, Paideia, Celaut, Sigs Mining, CU DAO, Rep System and more!

## Executive Summary

This development update focused heavily on Ergo's storage rent mechanism and mining pool developments. The hosts discussed how storage rent is successfully collecting ERG from inactive wallets (around 30 ERG collected in 24 hours from large dormant wallets), with fees ranging from 0.14 to 0.9 ERG every four years depending on box data size. The Sigmanauts mining pool reached significant milestones with 30 gigahash power and found three blocks in 24 hours. Mark the Shark demonstrated new containerized mining infrastructure called "Sigmanauts MegaCore" designed for easy deployment to Cardano stake pool operators.

The call covered extensive development progress across the Ergo ecosystem, including Rosen Bridge improvements with MetaMask integration, Paideia DAO fixes, and new educational initiatives. A notable real-world adoption case was presented where Cornell University is implementing an Ergo-based DAO for students to vote on $50,000+ in funding for computer lab improvements, demonstrating practical blockchain governance applications in academic settings.

## Key Discussion Points

• **Storage Rent Success**: Mechanism collecting ERG from dormant wallets, with 0.14-0.9 ERG fees every 4 years based on box data size
• **Mining Pool Achievements**: Sigmanauts pool reached 30 gigahash, found 3 blocks in 24 hours, collecting significant storage rent
• **MegaCore Development**: New containerized mining solution targeting Cardano stake pool operators for cross-ecosystem adoption
• **Cornell University DAO**: Real implementation of Paideia DAO for student governance of $50,000+ lab funding
• **Rosen Bridge Progress**: MetaMask integration completed, eRosen support implemented with improved retry mechanisms
• **Developer Tool Updates**: FleetSDK v0.6.4 released, new blockchain indexing completed in under 24 hours
• **Educational Initiatives**: Token creation for university peer-to-peer economy, mining adoption outreach planned

## Decisions Made

• **Pool Migration**: Old Sigmanauts mining pool to be shut down, all miners must migrate to new infrastructure
• **Storage Rent Integration**: Full deployment to mainnet with automatic collection from qualifying boxes
• **Cornell DAO Timeline**: Student presentation scheduled for September 19th to explain DAO functionality and blockchain integration
• **Cross-chain Mining Strategy**: Formal proposal to Ergo Foundation for Cardano stake pool operator outreach program

## Notable Quotes

> "Storage rent on Ergo... takes a super majority, super consensus, 90% or more in a fork to do any of those kind of serious changes. So again, miners aren't going to be voting against their interest." - **qx()**

> "The ecosystem of a college is like perfect for blockchain just with all the different sort of bartering mechanisms you could do." - **Marc the Shark**

> "We have a mechanism to ensure a stable and fixed supply while keeping the ledger and dust under control. How dare you think that far ahead?" - **qx()** (responding to storage rent criticism)
