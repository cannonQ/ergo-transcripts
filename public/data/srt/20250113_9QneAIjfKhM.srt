1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Welcome, everybody. We wanted to put
together a 2025 video. We've done that in

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
previous years, so I thought it'd be good
to spend some time with Alex and catch up

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
with Ergo, how things are going and where
we're going, I guess, most importantly. So

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
how are you doing today, Alex?

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Hello everyone, yeah, doing well. So it's
weekend but busy with Ergo development, so

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
just published sub-blocks, so inputs and
ordering blocks. EAP draft initial one,

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
but yeah, we'll improve it in the coming
days. And yeah, we're also working on

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,000
prototyping codes. There is some already
done, but more will be done. And yeah,

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,000
well, a lot of other things going on at
the same time. So with 6.0 development,

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:05,000
6.0 audits, and so on. So yeah, well, it's
a busy, busy time.

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
So why don't we start with the
sub-blocks, since that's kind of in your

12
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
mind already. Where do you see kind of the
use of sub-blocks. Those of you that don't

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
know, it's been inspired by Prism and as
well as Parallel Proof of Work, which I

14
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
believe Agolos came out with that paper.
So what do you see that doing to the

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
network and how do you see that changing
not only transactions and user experience,

16
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
but mining in general?

17
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Yeah, also bottlenecks. So currently,
well, it's, you know, well, on average,

18
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:59,000
every two minutes on average. Yeah, a new
block is being generated, propagated over

19
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:08,000
the network, right, and well, the network
has a big load, right, every two minutes,

20
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:17,000
but other than that, well, the load is
minimal, right, so the network is idle.

21
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:26,000
The sub-blocks, well, the loads will
become spread, right? So, well, the

22
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:35,000
network would be busy all the time and
yes, well, the bottleneck is moving to

23
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:44,000
network bandwidth, right? And well, this
resource network bandwidth is hopefully

24
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:53,000
will become more and more available with
time, right? So even with well flat

25
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:02,000
peer-to-peer network, we will get better
performance every year basically.

26
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Awesome. So how do you see that differing
from how many other cryptocurrencies are

27
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
attempting to kind of scale their
bandwidth?

28
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Yeah, but most are not even trying,
right? So, well, the general approach

29
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:32,000
unfortunately seen now is just to make
networks less peer-to-peer, more

30
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:40,000
centralized, right? So, well, to rely on
just, well, powerful validators in data

31
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:48,000
centers, so powerful machines with a lot
of well, memory and bandwidth. But then,

32
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:56,000
yeah, well, it's also about, well,
increasing centralization, right, in

33
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:04,000
regards to many aspects like validation.
So most of our network clients just have

34
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:12,000
to trust those powerful validators. And
yeah, well, it's also about centralization

35
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:20,000
of power, decision-making in the community
to some degree, and also centralization of

36
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:28,000
assets ownership, because usually those
validators also have big stake, right? And

37
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:36,000
they are going to have a bigger stake.
That's why they are willing to block,

38
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:44,000
right? So, well, it's kind of a digital
oligarchy, right? After all.

39
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Yeah, there's a lot of systems where you
have stake dominance and then you have

40
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
order flow dominance. And then, you know,
you kind of just have these kings in the

41
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
system, right?

42
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Right, but also they're becoming more and
more powerful, right? And, well, with that

43
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:16,000
validation, centralization, there are also
ones which don't know what's going on in

44
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:24,000
the network even, right? Yeah, the massive
gap, it seems. Yeah, but then also, well,

45
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:32,000
a lot of blockchains just doing something,
just one specific step, right? And not

46
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:40,000
always correct. So many are switching to
proof of stake with claim that it is

47
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:48,000
improving network performance, which is
not the case already quite seen from my

48
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Ethereum experience, for example, right?
Many are introducing very weird concepts

49
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:04,000
such as sharding, so fragmenting liquidity
in DeFi. This also having quite weird and

50
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:12,000
inconvenient consequences in the real
world. So even sharding author Vitalik is

51
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:20,000
now not talking about this anymore. And so
on and so on. Many just changing constants

52
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:28,000
that was popular in Bitcoin forks. just
well-increasing block size, for example,

53
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:36,000
and claiming that this is somehow related
to scaling, right, and so on. So, well, in

54
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Ergo, well, it was multi-level approach
since day one, right, so it was the first

55
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:52,000
network implementing stateless clients, as
well as so-called lock-space mining.

56
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Right, and now bandwidth utilization,
right. And well, doing all this preserving

57
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:08,000
peer-to-peer nature of the network. which
is always sometimes tricky, but yeah,

58
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:16,000
well, it's the goal after to have a real
peer-to-peer network.

59
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Yeah, it's foundational. I think that
ultimately without that foundation

60
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
everything else you build, you know, just
as a different animal. And it's

61
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
interesting to see how, I don't know, it's
like everything is being abstracted

62
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
further and further and further away from
the notion of a peer-to-peer network,

63
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
right?

64
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Right, and also, yeah, peer-to-peer
exchange after all, right? So, well, with

65
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:06,000
peer-to-peer network, naturally, you have
also peer-to-peer exchange, right? So,

66
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:14,000
well, even if we are doing some smart
contract, right, it's just between you and

67
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:22,000
me, right? It should be. We shouldn't have
some contracts backed by VCs with, I don't

68
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:30,000
know, admin keys belong to developers and
VCs and, I don't know, them deciding to

69
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:38,000
follow some regulations, I don't know.
Which probably, well, you don't care

70
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:46,000
about, right? Because, well, it's not even
about your jurisdiction, maybe, right? But

71
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:54,000
still it's enforced. Yeah, and also there
could be, I don't know, different

72
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:02,000
adversarial actions, right, from those
owners and also hackers and so on and the

73
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:10,000
question is why do we need to accept all
these rights when it's about peer-to-peer

74
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:18,000
interaction.

75
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I think that's mostly lost, sadly, in the
crypto space, right? Where, you know, it's

76
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:32,000
no longer about like my ability to I don't
know, interact directly with you with no

77
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:38,000
intermediary or no point of control in the
middle. Right. And things have been, I

78
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:44,000
don't know, shifting for a long time in
the crypto industry space to where now

79
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:50,000
it's quote unquote web three, whatever
that means. versus peer-to-peer.

80
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Yeah, and so yeah, this web3 usually
means nothing, right? So there was a

81
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:09,000
foundational article by Gavin Wood but
yeah well initially the term was used for

82
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:17,000
actually very different things right so
initially it was introduced by Tim

83
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Berners-Lee and Web3 by Tim Berners-Lee
was about making a web machine-friendly,

84
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:33,000
right, by using semantic web tools and so
on. But then, yeah, well... Gavin Wood

85
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:41,000
maybe because of not being very literate
about, I don't know, works of other

86
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:49,000
people, foundational works, by the way,
and well, already quite established. So

87
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:57,000
well, I visited Web3 conferences back in
2008, 2009, right? So before all those

88
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:05,000
blockchains and yeah, I mean, people
discussed all that stuff by Tim

89
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Berners-Lee. But okay, so yeah, we heard
maybe not very literate guy from Ethereum

90
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:21,000
will reintroduce the term, but what we
have now is not corresponding even to

91
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:29,000
that, right? And currently Web3 is mostly
just some web term used to introduce

92
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:37,000
tokens mostly, right? And yeah, the token
game with VCs, right? Backing your

93
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:45,000
tokenomics, let's say. So yeah, well,
aside of that, well, most of Web3 projects

94
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:53,000
don't make any sense, to be honest.

95
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:02,000
No, I think 2025 is definitely going to
be an interesting year to watch like

96
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:08,000
general mission drift in the
cryptocurrency space where it started with

97
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:14,000
this idea of peer to peer networks and
censorship resistant exchange between

98
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:20,000
anyone anywhere in the world to, yeah,
more. I don't know. I think as you see

99
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:26,000
regulation and friendlier potential,
there's going to be a lot of honeypotting

100
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:32,000
where people try to position for control
in essence, right? Like the magic of

101
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Bitcoin initially was like if under these
certain set of assumptions, you can assume

102
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:44,000
that the network is honest and operating
trustlessly, right? And things have kind

103
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:50,000
of been re-engineered to where there's all
these different layers or wrappers of

104
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:56,000
trust, you know, up and down different
stacks to where it's hard to call certain

105
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:02,000
things like DeFi when, you know, at the
end of the day, you're talking about

106
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:08,000
things with potentially a lot of legal
entanglement and backing by government

107
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:14,000
bonds and, you know, all kinds of strange
beasts coming into the space. So I don't

108
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:20,000
know. I think that long term, that's going
to be an interesting differentiator is the

109
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:26,000
idea of like compliance and the potential
reward trade off on that side versus

110
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:32,000
trying to remain open and neutral and
censorship resistant. You know, in a world

111
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:38,000
where I think that schism is going to just
increase from where we are today.

112
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Interesting. Yeah.

113
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Yeah. So, well, going back to sub-blocks.
So, oh, yeah, well, that would bring

114
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:58,000
network performance to theoretical
maximum, right? It's possible for

115
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:05,000
peer-to-peer network. But then, yeah,
well, always possible to make

116
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:12,000
optimizations, right? For, well, message
exchange and peer-to-peer networks. And

117
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:19,000
also networking is making progress from
year to year and well with that there will

118
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:26,000
be a natural performance increase and well
in Ergo well it's. It was chosen to have

119
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:33,000
flexible approach, right? So to avoid any
magic constants here like block size and

120
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:40,000
so on. So to give miners possibility to
readjust parameters because well, we have

121
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:47,000
progress in the hardware, right? And not
just hardware with time.

122
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Yeah, yeah, I do hope that, you know, we
see a lot more miner involvement. Seeing

123
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,000
the Sigmanauts pool starting to implement
demurrage is pretty awesome. I saw that

124
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,000
they had thrown up a mining and ecosystem
development grant from the EF, which I

125
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,000
know that you and I are no longer directly
a part of, but I certainly I hope that

126
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,000
those that are looking at the EF take a
long look and see kind of the value of

127
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,000
mining because that's, you know, proof of
work is, I don't know, becoming less

128
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,000
common, I guess, in terms of how people
are thinking. But I don't know, maybe that

129
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,000
has to do with like just education, right?
So having some initiative to demonstrate

130
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,000
the value of mining and decentralization
and, you know, kind of what Ergo is

131
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,000
working towards with GPU mining, I think
would be really valuable. especially

132
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,000
given, I don't know, crypto is a crazy
space, my friend. I read things all the

133
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,000
time where I just kind of scratch my head.

134
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Yeah, I actually think proof-of-work
assets are getting appreciation and the

135
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:18,000
more proof-of-stake assets we have, the
more valuable perspective proof-of-work

136
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:26,000
assets may become. Because well,
proof-of-stake is giving holders free

137
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:34,000
money basically, right? We are staking.
And well, with those free money, people

138
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:42,000
are often buying hard money, right? So
proof of work currencies. So I think this

139
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:50,000
is one of the reasons why Ethereum is
doing poorly after the merge, right? So

140
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:58,000
well, now, well, Ethereum stakeholders are
getting free money via staking, right? And

141
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:06,000
well, what I'm thinking about, probably
they are buying Bitcoin mostly, right,

142
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:14,000
with those staking. And that's also
probably happening with Ergo and Cardano

143
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:22,000
maybe, right? And well, I think with time,
so with more and more proof of stake

144
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:30,000
assets, right? Means more and more free
money have been distributed. So well,

145
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:38,000
money you can get for nothing just for
having proof of stake assets, right? And

146
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:46,000
well, holding them. Basically, so people
would put those assets, proof-of-stake

147
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:54,000
free assets into proof-of-work, right?
This would make proof-of-work assets more

148
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:02,000
valuable with time. I don't see well
recognition of this pattern, but yeah, I

149
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:10,000
think it's emerging actually.

150
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,000
It could be. It could be. I think, like,
with Ethereum, there was a period of time

151
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,000
where they had this, you know, distributed
proof of work security wall that was

152
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,000
pretty amazing. And in my opinion, they
actually had the right incentives in terms

153
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,000
of MEV distribution, where because, you
know, MEV itself was kind of being

154
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,000
democratized through mining pools and
adding to mining rewards, it created the

155
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,000
right incentive for mining growth, right?
Meaning it's like that value is being

156
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,000
distributed to support the security
budget. And it's shifted a lot in a lot of

157
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,000
proof of stake systems to where that value
is, it goes to internal entities, it goes

158
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,000
to, you know, like, you know, entrenched
parties, which doesn't create an economic

159
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,000
incentive, you know, for people to join
versus having fee distribution. So I think

160
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,000
that's a powerful vertical that, you know,
hopefully, you know, I know, qx() has been

161
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,000
looking at MEV and various potential cases
for Lithos, which I guess we'll get to

162
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,000
later. But I really believe that, you
know, demurrage and MEV distribution, it's

163
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,000
creating the right incentives for a
growing act set of security actors, I

164
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,000
guess.

165
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Yeah, but also with proof of work, well,
new Ethereum tokens were not for free,

166
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:59,000
right? So, well, miners actually put a lot
of work into the mining distributed

167
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:08,000
supercomputer to get them, right? via work
lottery. But now, yeah, well, new, well,

168
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Ethereum tokens are basically for free,
right? So you just need to hold assets,

169
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:26,000
right? And well, then, yeah, well, you,
you can basically, well, exchange them to

170
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Bitcoin, right, depending on pricing,
because you don't value, right, those free

171
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:44,000
assets. Because the intrinsic value for
those tokens is well about zero. Just a

172
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:53,000
little bit of computational efforts to
validate and propagate blocks around the

173
00:20:53,000 --> 00:21:02,000
network.

174
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:12,000
So speaking of kind of financial
products, you know, sometimes I get a lot

175
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:18,000
of questions, you know, why Ergo is
focusing on introducing, you know,

176
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:24,000
different stable coins, stable coins
design, different backings or pegs to

177
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:30,000
algorithmic stable coins. So, you know,
what in your mind kind of drew you to

178
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:36,000
explore the Dexy implementation? versus, I
guess, their traditional mindset is just

179
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:42,000
going to be, let's, you know, deal with
these freezancies, assets, you know, USDC,

180
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:48,000
whatever, you know, fill in the letter.
What made you more attracted to something

181
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:54,000
like Dexy versus, I guess, the traditional
stablecoin?

182
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Oh, but traditional are trusted, right?
So, well, you trust Tether team. I don't

183
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:14,000
know. I mean, I don't know who's there and
why should they be trusted and probably

184
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:22,000
they shouldn't, right? And even more, I
don't know, probably no one really has

185
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:30,000
trust, right? Tether folks, but still
people are using tether, which is quite

186
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:38,000
absurd. So yeah, well, then there are
different options, right? So you may have

187
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I don't know, like peer-to-peer trusted
currencies. So well, maybe you can try to

188
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:54,000
recreate a web of trust, right? So like
traditional solutions from public key

189
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:02,000
infrastructure, traditional decentralized
approaches. But yeah, I mean, you still

190
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:10,000
need for some buffer at least, right, for
some least common denominator, which is

191
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:18,000
about algorithmic stablecoins, I believe.
Right, so even if you, for example,

192
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:26,000
issuing your own dollars, I don't know, or
gold-backed tokens like Harmony or gold,

193
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:34,000
for example, right, and I'm accepting
them, but then I'm trying to pay with

194
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:42,000
them, right? So, well, who will trust,
right? And why people should trust? But

195
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:50,000
if, well, your tokens are backed at least
partially, right? Or maybe fully with

196
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:58,000
algorithmic stablecoin at the moment. I
mean, if there is backing at the moment,

197
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:06,000
right? Then, yeah, it's more or less
trustless, right? So trust issues are

198
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:14,000
solved here. If there is, well,
unconditional redemption possible, right?

199
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Well, redemption without your control at
least. So then, yeah, well, even if there

200
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:30,000
is, you know, these trusted issuance, like
if you're issuing your Armeanio tokens,

201
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:38,000
then yeah, it's better to back them with
algorithmic stable coins, right? And maybe

202
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:46,000
then work on eliminating or reducing need
for algorithmic stablecoin liquidity with

203
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:54,000
clearing, and so on. Or maybe have
fractional reserve, maybe like free

204
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:02,000
banking system, so eventually they went
into fractional reserve state anyway. But

205
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:10,000
yeah, well, for starters, you need for
backing, right? To get trust and so on.

206
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:18,000
And well, it would be much better than,
well, having a trust to Tether team and

207
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:26,000
well, government bonds they could have,
but I mean, that's also a question of

208
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:34,000
trust, right? Whether such an issue to
have, right? So they're trying to do

209
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:42,000
audits and so on, but yes, still, you
know, it's always a question of trust to

210
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:50,000
some degree, at least. What do you think?
But then, yeah, you also have trust in

211
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:58,000
government bonds, right? Transitional
trust and yeah, there are a lot of new

212
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:06,000
issues arising.

213
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:34,000
No, I think it breaks down to this idea
that as kind of, I don't know, you started

214
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:40,000
with Bitcoin, it was more or less a kind
of simple straightforward system. And as

215
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:46,000
things have become more complicated, you
know, you get new layers, new layers of

216
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:52,000
trust to where I think that in many cases
that's not a concern anymore for people.

217
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Ultimately, what leads the general person
to reevaluate trust is when it's misused

218
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:04,000
or abused against them, right? And, you
know, that's never an optimal way to learn

219
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:10,000
but I guess in a way that is going to kind
of be the path where let's see what the

220
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:16,000
friction points are. I don't know. It's
gonna be an interesting year. There's I

221
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:22,000
think there's gonna be a lot of like
entanglements as some systems push for

222
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:28,000
broader adoption and whatever compliance
or schism away from this idea of open and

223
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:34,000
censorship resistant trustless networks is
going to be. That's going to be the most

224
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:40,000
fascinating, let's say, vertical to watch
in probably the next couple of years in

225
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:46,000
the crypto space, I believe. But I agree.
I think that having algorithmic

226
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:52,000
stablecoins or some notion of an asset
that addresses volatility. You know,

227
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:58,000
because again, if somebody is going to use
cryptocurrencies as a form of payment, you

228
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:04,000
know, when you get in line at the store,
you want the same purchasing power when

229
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:10,000
you, you know, finish checking out as when
you got in line and sometimes like the

230
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:16,000
volatile nature of these assets doesn't
really do many favors in terms of kind of

231
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:22,000
creating the adoption for kind of stable
goods and services and exchange, et

232
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:28,000
cetera. So I really do believe that stable
coins in some sense have been and will be

233
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:34,000
kind of like the first killer use case for
programmable money where, you know, people

234
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:40,000
are experiencing inflation or simply want
to be more free from control systems and

235
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:46,000
you know it's a nice option to have.

236
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Right and yeah so well algorithmic stable
coins do have own cons right but still you

237
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:23,000
know well it's useful building block for
well more complex systems. So yeah, I

238
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:33,000
mean, even for, as I explained, trusted,
right? Stable coins like Armeanio gold in

239
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:43,000
my example. So, well, it makes sense to
have some trustless backing, right? So

240
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:53,000
yeah, algorithmic stable coins
essentially.

241
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:00,000
So another big vertical I think that's
quite interesting for the Ergo ecosystem

242
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:06,000
is cross-chaining, merge mining, just
interoperability in general. So with 6.0,

243
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:12,000
what are we opening the door to support in
terms of cross-chain interoperability on

244
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Ergo or side chains, double-merge mined
side chains, all of that kind of space

245
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:24,000
that we're growing into?

246
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Right, so it would be possible to have,
well, Bitcoin relays, right? Well, already

247
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:46,000
there is a prototype and then, well,
two-way relays with Autolykos or maybe

248
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:55,000
SHA-256 or whatever. Sigma side chains,
right? So you may have a relay on Ergo

249
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:04,000
chain and a relay on side chain. So
sidechain relay on Ergo mainchain and

250
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:13,000
mainchain relay on Sigma sidechain. And
with that, you may have even trustless

251
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:22,000
bridge, right, and other cross-chain
trustless applications. But yeah, there

252
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:31,000
are more options, right? Like we have
Rosen Bridge, right? To connect with,

253
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:40,000
well, chains which are not so easy to
connect in a trustless way, fully

254
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:49,000
trustless, such as Bitcoin, well, Ethereum
and so on, right? Most of popular chains.

255
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Yeah, I'm hoping that with Rosen, we
continue to expand across the various

256
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:05,000
ecosystems and points out there. And I
think 2025 is going to be interesting in

257
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:11,000
terms of plugging in market making bots on
top. Right. I really do believe that a

258
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:17,000
bridge has a just base transfer protocol
is well, interesting. It allows you to

259
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:23,000
create markets and open the door to
arbitrage across different environments

260
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:29,000
based on demand. But having the ability to
manage liquidity more seamlessly and

261
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:35,000
accelerate that, I really think is one of
the keys to growth long term you know as

262
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:41,000
well as potential solutions to kind of
intermix faster bridging and DeFi which

263
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:47,000
you know again accelerates kind of the
arbitrage potential but you know even

264
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:53,000
right Even beyond, I think, having kind of
relays and greater interoperability

265
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:59,000
between ecosystems is certainly something
I'm always going to encourage us to

266
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:05,000
support and grow into. I think there's a
lot of opportunity in that space that is

267
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:11,000
still mostly unrealized.

268
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Yeah, so I think applications are needed,
right? Well, in addition to bridges such

269
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:38,000
as, well, onramp, right? And DEX access
and so on. So, well, it would be good

270
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:48,000
maybe for a Bitcoiner, right? Somewhere to
use escrow contracts for, well, better

271
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:58,000
onramp, right? So to get from fiat to
Bitcoin. And then, yeah, maybe even to use

272
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Spectrum DEX to exchange a bit of Bitcoin
immediately to gold, for example, to have

273
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:18,000
exposure to both Bitcoin and gold.
Spending fiat on that and using Ergo

274
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:28,000
blockchain, right?

275
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Yeah, I think it's going to be an
interesting year for metal stable coins.

276
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:41,000
You know, if I put on my tinfoil hat and
say, OK, well, like if I could change the

277
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:47,000
trajectory of the crypto industry in one
way for me, I think that like I don't

278
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:53,000
know, we have these peer-to-peer networks
that are kind of, they're a wrapper of the

279
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:59,000
internet, right? And the internet itself
is its own kind of animal that's

280
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:05,000
decentralized. You have, you know,
endpoints all over the world. And I don't

281
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:11,000
know, I think that using fiat as like the
primary peg or wrapper for cryptocurrency

282
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:17,000
is just the wrong choice because it's
centralized. If the internet itself was

283
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:23,000
centralized and we tried to build
cryptocurrencies on top of a centralized

284
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:29,000
network, it would be doomed to fail. And I
think everyone can say like, yeah, that's

285
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:35,000
a terrible idea. We need like a
decentralized foundation to build off if

286
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:41,000
we want resilience. And the same thing is
true in terms of like the base monetary

287
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:47,000
network that we build off. We chose the
wrong one as an industry, in my opinion.

288
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Like, you know, gold and silver is every
country you can pretty much find some

289
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:59,000
fungibility dealer you know it's pretty
universally accepted there's friction

290
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:05,000
there but it is a decentralized base
monetary network versus fiat is its own

291
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:11,000
walled garden and so whenever you're going
to deal with like these walled

292
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:17,000
environments there's going to be a lot of
entanglements it's going to inevitably,

293
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:23,000
like control is going to creep up from
that foundation. So I think that at least

294
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:29,000
having, you know, algorithmic, you know,
gold and silver pegged assets, hopefully

295
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:35,000
open the doors to where we can start
building that foundation where metal

296
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:41,000
becomes a I don't know, potential rail in
certain areas. And in a way that's

297
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:47,000
backwards, right? It should, probably
should have been built the other way, but

298
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:53,000
it wasn't. And I think a lot of the
conflicts we're gonna run into as an

299
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:59,000
industry is because we built off the wrong
network. Like we didn't, again, go back to

300
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:05,000
the internet. If we use some central
system, how could we expect to be

301
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:11,000
resilient through time?

302
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Yeah, so I agree. So yeah, gold, silver,
maybe lithium even, right? So those assets

303
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:39,000
actually do have very impressive
decentralized mining networks, right? Much

304
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:48,000
more decentralized than Ergo or Bitcoin,
to be honest, right? So well, you can mine

305
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:57,000
gold with variety of tools right starting
with pretty medieval ones still used in

306
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:06,000
many areas around the globe to very
sophisticated chemistry based right more

307
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:15,000
modern chemistry based tech well and There
are players of very different scale,

308
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:24,000
right, from individuals and families in
Africa, for example, to huge corporations,

309
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:33,000
right, big nationwide corporations. So
yeah, well, players of very different

310
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:42,000
scale with very different tooling. And
yeah, to be honest, unlike proof of work

311
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:51,000
mining, so yeah, tooling is more
decentralized. Yeah, right. So well, let's

312
00:38:51,000 --> 00:39:00,000
be clear because there is no Well, economy
of scale we do have in hardware and well,

313
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:09,000
yeah, many attempts to... have more
decentralized production of hardware

314
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:18,000
actually failed, right? Because, well,
it's a hard field for competition. It's

315
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:27,000
very, very hard to compete with hardware
manufacturers, existing ones, right? If

316
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:36,000
you are starting to produce tools for
mining, digital mining. But yes, digital

317
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:45,000
mining is better than other ways to
produce digital assets.

318
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:01,000
I think GPU mining is in a very
interesting place, to be honest. You know,

319
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:07,000
in some sense, it's like Bitcoin has
created this market where, I don't know,

320
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:13,000
it's mostly about energy arbitrage, right?
Like, miners are naturally, like, going to

321
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:19,000
go to where there's excess energy and then
try to, you know, plug in and profit from

322
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:25,000
excess capacity, right? And it seems as
though, at least on the GPU side, we're

323
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:31,000
seeing massive scaling of infrastructure
around AI and, you know, LLMs. And it's

324
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:37,000
going to be interesting to see if long
term there's excess compute that then

325
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:43,000
becomes like this driver for where it's,
you know, most profitable to mine. It does

326
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:49,000
kind of make sense. If you look at like
proof of work is this mechanism of seeking

327
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:55,000
over capacity, right? And that's always
where it's more profitable is when you

328
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:01,000
have over capacity, cheaper energy,
cheaper, you know, hardware, et cetera. So

329
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:07,000
I think GPU mining is an interesting place
to be long-term actually.

330
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Right. But yeah, going back to physical
assets, so yeah, well, they have very well

331
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:27,000
established mining networks, right? And
well, pretty understandable distribution,

332
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:34,000
right? Made over centuries, if you're
talking about gold and silver, especially.

333
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:41,000
And so, yeah, well, also, well, you cannot
create gold or silver out of thin air,

334
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:48,000
right, unlike fiat currencies. So, well,
it's, yeah, I mean, it should be naturally

335
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:55,000
the basis, right, for stable coins or
peer-to-peer networks.

336
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Well, originally, you know, metal was the
peg for fiat, you know.

337
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Right, yeah.

338
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Like fiat was just a wrapper for, you
know, metal itself. So I guess in some

339
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:18,000
sense, having metal is like the base and
some digital wrapper of metal. This is an

340
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:24,000
interesting concept. Speaking of mining,
are you tracking the Lithos development at

341
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:30,000
all in terms of how that could potentially
shift the centralized or decentralized

342
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:36,000
nature of proof of work mining?

343
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:45,000
So, yeah, trying to get details, but
yeah, fairly general picture still, to be

344
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:51,000
honest. Well, trying to get details from
qx(), but yeah, well, it seems that there

345
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:57,000
will be a lot of interesting things there,
right? Even some, well, specific

346
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:03,000
applications, specific rollups. which is
quite interesting. And well, yeah, it's

347
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:09,000
quite ambitious, right? And yeah, well,
quite exciting, well, approach to

348
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:15,000
reworking mining. What do you think about
Lithos? Maybe you have more talks with

349
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:21,000
qx().

350
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Well, I think that ultimately if we can
get block production back towards the

351
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:37,000
individual miner away from pools, you
know, the network resilience of proof of

352
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:43,000
work and kind of like this ability to, I
don't know, censor validators is going to

353
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:49,000
make it a lot more resilient, right? You
know, we saw that in Bitcoin already. You

354
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:55,000
know, that's kind of been an ongoing
struggle with Ethereum as soon as they

355
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:01,000
went to proof of stake, where it's like,
you no longer have a fair network, in my

356
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:07,000
opinion, like, okay, in Bitcoin, Because
Bitcoin is a bit dumb by nature it's more

357
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:13,000
of like you get your payment later right
now and that's not so terrible I guess

358
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:19,000
depending on market conditions maybe at
that at the wrong time some you know if

359
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:25,000
you have block producers that are saying
hey you're not gonna be in our block and

360
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:31,000
you get kicked down the chain enough you
know you could definitely encounter some

361
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:37,000
like severe price impacts or something but
it'll get there eventually right when you

362
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:43,000
talk about like a network like Ethereum
where race conditions are a lot more

363
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:49,000
complicated because you have other assets.
Then things get really sketchy, right?

364
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Like you have DeFi and you have collateral
that you're trying to like cover based on

365
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:01,000
market conditions or you have an
opportunity that's based on race

366
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:07,000
conditions. You simply broke the network.
You have you can't have like multi-tier

367
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:13,000
user base where you know one person can
come into a block half the time and

368
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:19,000
economically compete with somebody that
can always be included in a block like

369
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:25,000
that's that's a breaking assumption and in
my opinion for any like, yeah, neutral

370
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:31,000
economy. So I think if we like,
ultimately, the way around that has to be

371
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:37,000
like become uncensorable. And it makes
sense in my framework that the only way to

372
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:43,000
do that is to empower the individual
miners. So there's not some like pool

373
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:49,000
that, you know, inherits that liability.
Does that make sense? Right, right. Which

374
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:55,000
I guess gets you back to non-outsourceable
puzzles. Why was that valuable when Ergo

375
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:01,000
first launched? Kind of the same concept,
right? Right. So I do think that long term

376
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:07,000
that's still probably going like from an
outside attack perspective. I think going

377
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:13,000
after how blocks are built and like the
choke points around fiat rails are the two

378
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:19,000
primary like regulatory vectors. So
hopefully, you know, we can be a bit

379
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:25,000
hardened.

380
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Yeah, so I think, yeah, well, talking
about non-outsourceable puzzles and

381
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Lithos. So I think for, well, every proof
of work currency, it should be in

382
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:50,000
desiderata rights to, well, have
protection against pooling, right? But

383
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:57,000
then, yeah, yeah, you have a lot of real
world rights.

384
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Forces yeah you have you have incentives
and I think that if you could create the

385
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:10,000
right incentives to encourage local block
production, then it's feasible. Because

386
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:16,000
that's ultimately why people pool their
hashrate anyway, is more predictable

387
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:22,000
revenue flows or mining flows. There's an
incentive to do so, and it's hard to say,

388
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:28,000
okay, we're going to operate on principle
and not incentives. That's a failed...

389
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:34,000
that's gonna be a failed system real
quick. Altruism is a terrible security

390
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:40,000
assumption in the wild, I guess. So yeah,
I think we're in for an interesting time.

391
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Why don't we get into ChainCash? I know
that's kind of been something that's been

392
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:52,000
of in and out of your mind for years, you
know, building free banking or alternative

393
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:58,000
economies on top of Ergo.

394
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Oh, actually, yeah, I mean, initial
thoughts appeared before the mainnet

395
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:20,000
launch even, so back in 2018 probably.
Right, something like that, but yeah, so

396
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:28,000
the original idea was, so it had a
different name even. Yeah, and the idea

397
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:36,000
was to have a circle of circles, basically
to have different local exchange trading

398
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:44,000
systems, right, because that was
primitive, known to me back then. So I

399
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:52,000
started with that so that the idea was to
have well collateralized local exchange

400
00:48:52,000 --> 00:49:00,000
trading systems and non-collateralized and
then to have some exchange right between

401
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:08,000
different circles between different LETS
systems and having gateways some economy,

402
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:16,000
right, well for actors willing to project
liquidity from one kind of financial

403
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:24,000
system to another, right, and so on. But
yeah, then, yeah, so somehow I realized

404
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:32,000
that, well, ChainCash so well spender
signed currency based system could be

405
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:40,000
actually a more general right so with that
you may include local exchange trading

406
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:48,000
systems as well as I don't know very
different systems right you know in a

407
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:56,000
single financial system global one and
having basically the same right and well

408
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:04,000
anyway you would have conditional
acceptance right like in LETS of LETS

409
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:12,000
circle of circles right but yeah also more
flexibility and so on so that was quite

410
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:20,000
evolutionary process But yeah, so I think,
well, it's the natural next step talking

411
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:28,000
about ChainCash. So well, you have
blockchain assets, right? So talking about

412
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:36,000
proof of work assets or proof of work
derived assets like ones with emission

413
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:44,000
contracts tied to proof of work. blocks
production such as I don't know auction

414
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:52,000
coin maybe even rights or well maybe
currencies with emission contracts with

415
00:50:52,000 --> 00:51:00,000
the emission going to miners, right, like
some projects did, but only for part of

416
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:08,000
tokens. But if we are talking about whole
supply going to miners, then yeah, it's

417
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:16,000
not that different from ERG, even maybe
from native token, right, in regards with

418
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:24,000
money production. So yeah, we have those
hard assets, Ergo, other proof of work

419
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:32,000
cryptocurrencies. Well, if they do have
good distribution like Bitcoin. Right,

420
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:40,000
then, yeah, maybe we have assets of, I
don't know, the different quality, let's

421
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:48,000
say, right? But then, yeah, still for the
real world, you need for some expansion,

422
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:56,000
right? You need to introduce trust
sometimes. You need to combine trust and

423
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:04,000
collateral and so on. So a variety of
options to expand trust. monetary base or

424
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:12,000
blockchain assets to, well, money being
used in the real world. So that's more or

425
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:20,000
less like monetary systems are working in
the real world, right? Where you have

426
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:28,000
some, well, monetary base, like M0
aggregates, right? And well, on top of

427
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:36,000
that, you are creating more and more
derivative layers but here yeah it's still

428
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:44,000
peer-to-peer right so well it's based on
individual choice of security parameters

429
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:52,000
and so on and yeah so it's it's it's a non
It's non-enforceable, right? Also, no

430
00:52:52,000 --> 00:53:00,000
actor should force you to accept assets
you don't like, right? Like happening with

431
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:08,000
fiat currency, for example, which you have
to accept if you run a business in some

432
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:16,000
jurisdiction, for example, right? Yeah,
you almost always saw in almost all the

433
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:24,000
jurisdictions, you have to accept fiat
currency rights of all that jurisdiction.

434
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:32,000
And yeah, in ChainCash, so yeah, it's kind
of free. And yeah, free banking system

435
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:40,000
basically, right? So the different agents
are free to issue their money, but then

436
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:48,000
yeah, it's up to you which money to
accept. So it's more or less like, well,

437
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:56,000
free banking systems existed in many
countries before central banks, well, to

438
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:04,000
power our money issues.

439
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:45,000
It's going to be interesting to see.
ChainCash, I don't know, could grow a lot

440
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:50,000
of different ways. Like the circle within
circles idea is interesting. Looking at

441
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:55,000
how like the shadow banking system will
have to retool itself based on like

442
00:54:55,000 --> 00:55:00,000
potential changes. And, you know, let's
say we do get central bank digital

443
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:05,000
currencies, that's going to be interesting
to see how like, you know, shadow banking

444
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:10,000
sides of economy and gray markets, black
markets coexist. within the centralized

445
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:15,000
beast that's coming. It's gonna be an
interesting world, my friend. I think you

446
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:20,000
and I will be alive the day that cash
disappears, right? And it's quite

447
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:25,000
interesting to game theory out. What comes
next? Right. And I think that at some

448
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:30,000
point, like a reversion back to metals
makes sense, because what else are you

449
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:35,000
going to have that you can have custody of
and you have strong trust assumptions

450
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:40,000
with? I don't know. We're in for an
interesting time, I guess.

451
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:58,000
Right, but you can combine blockchains
with metals, right? So you may have, I

452
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:06,000
don't know, physical gold, which is
secured with algorithmic rights, like what

453
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:14,000
Palmyra is planning to do with lithium
rights or to secure lithium which is not

454
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:22,000
produced yet with algorithmic stable coins
and similarly you can secure brick of gold

455
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:30,000
which is not delivered yet to your control
party with algorithmic stable coin rights

456
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:38,000
and then yeah you use also some escrow
contract for security right for for kind

457
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:46,000
of insurance And then, yeah, so this way
you can use metals, right, but with also

458
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:54,000
some additional security provided by
blockchain, but also well in a

459
00:56:54,000 --> 00:57:02,000
capital-efficient way, right. And then you
also can actually issue I don't know, more

460
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:10,000
relaxed money like ChainCash, right? On
top of metals secured by stable coins, for

461
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:18,000
example, and so on. You can just issue
ChainCash notes on top of algorithmic

462
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:26,000
stable coins and so on. So yeah, a variety
of options. And yeah, you can have things

463
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:34,000
done in a pretty capital-efficient way
here, right, using clearing, mutual credit

464
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:42,000
clearing and so on. So not so much backing
would be needed even because that's also,

465
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:50,000
well, a hard problem, right? So you may
have trustless assets like over

466
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:58,000
collateralized algorithmic stable coins,
but they're not capital efficient, right?

467
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:06,000
So you need to do something right to not
to use so much of those assets. So to use

468
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:14,000
clearing as much as possible, right? So to
minimize amount of stable coins, used

469
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:22,000
over-collateralized stable coins.

470
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:38,000
That's an interesting, interesting
thought. Going back to the future of Ergo,

471
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:44,000
what would you say is the long-term vision
goal plan for the ecosystem community,

472
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:50,000
development community, and how best to
engage users and developers to get

473
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:56,000
involved in the vision and the future of
building Ergo?

474
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Yeah, so I think we actually have
discussed, right, different aspects of

475
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:19,000
future of Ergo, such as well, more stable
coins, well, tools for monetary expansion,

476
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:29,000
then cross-chaining to bring more assets
and also to bring applications to other

477
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:39,000
blockchains. Decentralized onramp, which
is getting more and more critically

478
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:49,000
needed, right? Especially, well, with
degradation of centralized exchanges we

479
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:59,000
are witnessing. And then, yeah, well,
decentralized marketplaces. What else?

480
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:09,000
There would be needs probably in many
areas for off-chain solutions, layer-2

481
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:19,000
networks, right, for, well, cheap. maybe
almost free transactions here also, maybe,

482
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:29,000
well, very fast, right? Well, maybe even
sub-blocks would be not fast enough. You

483
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:39,000
may use Lithos and so on. And yeah, so I
think, well, all those things combined and

484
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:49,000
those things are not imaginary, right?
prototypes at least for almost all of

485
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:59,000
them. Sometimes we have tooling already
available, but just maybe not tested and

486
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:09,000
used much. With all those things we may
say that Ergo is actually a kind of end

487
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:19,000
game for crypto. envisioned by godfathers
of Bitcoin. Maybe not in detailed way

488
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:29,000
because they were not capable to figure
out details back in 2009, 2008, 2009.

489
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Sometimes it's quite funny actually to
read the writings as well as, I don't

490
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:49,000
know, even earlier writings from 2000s
like different Cypherpunk writings on

491
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:59,000
future of peer-to-peer digital cash. But
yeah, now I think we have a pretty

492
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:09,000
well-established and detailed approach,
which is finally allowing to achieve

493
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:19,000
dreams from 2000s. And yeah, that's what
we need for more developers, enthusiasts,

494
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:29,000
monetary hackers, jazz hackers. So well,
enthusiasts, running experience and so on.

495
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:44,000
No, I think at some point, you know, life
is a circle. Right. So I think at some

496
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:50,000
point, you know, this idea of like, I
don't know, wrappers with a lot of

497
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:56,000
different control points on top of
wrappers with a lot of different control

498
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:02,000
points will be problematic. Right. And
when it becomes problematic, then this

499
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:08,000
idea of, you know, peer to peer finance
between you and me with nobody else in the

500
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:14,000
middle will become more attractive. I
guess, I don't know, there's always a lot

501
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:20,000
of hype and marketing and I don't know,
salesmanship, guruing in the crypto space.

502
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:26,000
But I think at the end of the day, that's
ultimately the kind of first principles

503
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:32,000
approach is to stay low and peer to peer.
system. And, you know, I do hope that, you

504
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:38,000
know, perhaps 2025, perhaps 2026, we start
to explore, you know, perhaps enhancements

505
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:44,000
in privacy, new Sigma protocols being
supported, etc. I don't know for there

506
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:50,000
yet. But, you know, it seems like we have
a foundation where, you know, that very

507
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:56,000
well could be 7.0 or 8.0 or whatever.
Let's see.

508
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:12,000
Yeah, so I guess sigma chains or layer 2s
could be useful for privacy, right?

509
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:21,000
Especially if it's possible to break link
between well, entering and exiting layer

510
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:30,000
2, which should be possible in Ergo, by
the way. For example, you may enter layer

511
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:39,000
2. with the condition to exit to stealth
address, which is what I'm thinking about

512
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:48,000
a little bit. But yeah, I need to write
down all those things. But yeah, well, it

513
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:57,000
would be good to get more researchers'
rights, also hacking around all that

514
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:06,000
stuff. Absolutely. So yeah, well, going
back. So yeah, I think in 2025 it is

515
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:15,000
critically needed to get more actors, more
organizations, maybe even in the Ergo

516
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:24,000
ecosystem. And it is critically needed to
get some more researchers and yeah, more

517
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:33,000
developers, core developers, application
developers. and, yeah, well, more users,

518
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:42,000
right, more, well, enthusiasts, more
teachers, right, explaining, well,

519
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:51,000
technology, right, to the masses.

520
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:58,000
I think ultimately that might be the
starting point, right? If I look back at

521
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:04,000
the history of Ergo so far, it seems as
though DECO was actually one of the

522
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:10,000
biggest like aggravators and motivators
for growth and development expansion. Just

523
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:16,000
kind of that free YouTube course where,
you know, covered the like base

524
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:22,000
foundations of Ergo UTXO building on Ergo
sigma etc so i i think that's always going

525
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:28,000
to be something we should be really
mindful of is kind of that intro ramp and

526
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:34,000
education for people out there that you
know are interested because i don't know

527
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:40,000
it's I don't want to say crypto has a lot
of foolish teachers around but it's a

528
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:46,000
crazy goddamn space my friend.

529
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:59,000
So I think there should be focus in 2025
on, well, growing a new generation of

530
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:06,000
Sigmanauts, right? So it's always needed.
And yeah, well, I think that's, yes,

531
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:13,000
sometimes it's missed, right? So that's,
yeah, well, for a Sigmanaut, yeah, the

532
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:20,000
first goal should be to I don't know, grow
replacements, right? Well, expand the

533
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:27,000
movement.

534
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:34,000
Yeah, I really hope that through time we
become less important. That would be

535
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:38,000
awesome to see.

536
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:45,000
All right, so yeah, well, let's have
exciting 2025. I'm pretty sure it will be

537
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:51,000
pretty crazy, but hopefully exciting here.

538
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:56,000
Buckle up, wear a helmet, let's have some
fun.

539
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:59,000
All right, bye everybody.
