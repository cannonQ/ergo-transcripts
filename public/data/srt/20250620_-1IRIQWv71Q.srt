1
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Hey, everyone.

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
How's it going?

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Good morning, everybody.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
It's good to be here.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
How are you doing, kushti?

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Doing well, doing well.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
How about you?

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Doing all right.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
No work today.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Today's Juneteenth in the United States.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So my place shuts down.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Federal holiday.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I think a lot of places do.

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Oh, is it some holiday today?

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Yeah, it's the emancipation of
recognition of the emancipation of slaves

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
in Galveston, Texas in 1865.

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,000
So, yeah, so they recognize that here in
the U.S. as a federal holiday and

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,000
everybody gets the 19th off for
recognition of it.

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
All right, all right.

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
So, yeah.

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
How's it been, kushti?

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
How's your week been?

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
You been busy?

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Yeah, busy and today is also busy and I
think there will be final 6.0 release

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
today, finally.

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
So, yeah, just checking some things and
yeah, I think it will be released today

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
along with instructions for the mining
pools on how to work because, yeah, I

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,000
guess since

29
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:46,000
2022, probably every mining pool has
forgotten, right?

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
The latest soft fork was in 2022.

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:59,000
In 2023, they were only, well, very
major, but client-side only updates such

32
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:07,000
as support for

33
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:14,000
NIPoPoWs bootstrapping and bootstrapping
with UTXO set snapshots right and then

34
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:21,000
yeah well since 2024 there was work on 6.0
and then yeah on sub-blocks slowly so now

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:28,000
we are going to roll out 6.0 soft fork

36
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:37,000
update, waiting for it, and then yeah,
well, sub-blocks, there will be another

37
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:45,000
DevNet release call for testing DevNet
probably next week, but let's see.

38
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
So I'm currently even doing some load
testing locally and yeah, there are some

39
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
inefficiencies found.

40
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:02,000
as well as some probably bugs to discover
and so on.

41
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
How do we know the difference in releases
between one running on RocksDB and one

42
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
running on the other database so that we
don't mess it up?

43
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Yeah, so there will be two 6.0 releases,
6.0, 6.1 probably.

44
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:29,000
But yeah, well there was 5.0.27 release
yesterday as well and well 5.1.4 I believe

45
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:36,000
is postponed a bit so I need to get

46
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:44,000
So in the latest RocksDB release there
was an update from RocksDB dependency

47
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:51,000
version 8 to version 9 and there were some
complaints so now it would be good to

48
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:58,000
discuss whether we roll back to version 8
or we'll update it further to version 10.

49
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
So your 0.1 releases are the RocksDB
database?

50
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Your 0.0 releases are the old database?

51
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
LevelDB, yes.

52
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
So yeah, the original DB.

53
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Actually, not the original, but yeah,
well, the very original database was on

54
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:27,000
key-value database called IODB made in IO.

55
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Then, yeah, we switched to LevelDB
because, well, that guy was not very

56
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:42,000
stable in maintaining IODB.

57
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Quite a famous guy, but yeah, also quite
unstable in regards with maintaining his

58
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:58,000
product such as MapDB, IODB.

59
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:09,000
then yeah so our LevelDB and yeah so
still we are on LevelDB since 2019 and

60
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:19,000
yeah well as support for LevelDB is also
not so quite good right so we are still

61
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:29,000
using drivers from 2018 so yeah well how
after all yeah we started

62
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Gradual switch to RocksDB, which is at
least well maintained at the moment.

63
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Well, 5.0 is about LevelDB, 5.1 is about
RocksDB, but then, yeah, well,

64
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:53,000
unfortunately, less platforms supported at
the moment.

65
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:01,000
And, yeah, well, there are also some
complaints about the latest version,

66
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:08,000
introduced an update to a newer version of
RocksDB, but we have even newer version.

67
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
So, yeah, well, some testing is needed.

68
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
in regards to that.

69
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:19,000
But yes, 6.0 will be released for
LevelDB.

70
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
So to the best of my knowledge, all the
mining pools on LevelDB version, at least

71
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
mining pools I will touch with.

72
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
So yeah, we are going to release 6.0 in
the first place.

73
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Something like that, so yeah, it's the
whole zoo of different versions, so

74
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:48,000
hopefully after 6.0 we can do something
with that.

75
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Let's see.

76
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Cool.

77
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Looking forward to it.

78
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
We have a modified node for SIG's mining
pool, so we'll have to be on top of that

79
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
to make sure that that gets modified, the
new one.

80
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Oh, so is it 5.1?

81
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:10,000
no no we're on 50 something 50 5018 or
5019 something like that oh maybe even

82
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:17,000
5020 yeah in the first place it would be
good to update to 5026 like some mining

83
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:24,000
pools already did which is introducing

84
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
periodic regeneration of can block
candidate which is providing quicker

85
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
confirmations.

86
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Oh, great.

87
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It's a good point.

88
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Yeah.

89
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Oh, we're going to see if you can update
the 6.0 to

90
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:49,000
So 6.0 is five or 26 based after all.

91
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
So, yeah, a lot of things like that.

92
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Then, yeah, well, about one week ago,
well, SigmaChain's refactoring plan was

93
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,000
published and, yeah, it's also on the
table.

94
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:10,000
So, currently investigating and
discussing with people

95
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Well, I had a talk with Bruno, for
example, just one hour ago about Zephyr

96
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
and so on.

97
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Zephyr is a Djed-based, somewhat private
stablecoin, actually just fork of Monero

98
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:33,000
with a Djed implemented in client code.

99
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
But yeah, so we discussed and yeah, it
seems it's possible to do more interesting

100
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
things and so on.

101
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,000
But yeah, well, from following that plan
published, I think, well, merge mined

102
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
sidechains probably is a low-hanging
fruit, right?

103
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
And well, we can propose actually a lot
of designs more interesting than Zephyr

104
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
and so on.

105
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:11,000
to to the different to to the world right
to the different teams and then yeah well

106
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:20,000
maybe some will be implemented by

107
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:29,000
how to call it the developers we know
right like in inner circle well community

108
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Ergo community let's say and then yeah
well also discussing yeah then different

109
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:45,000
funding options right for implementing
such things and so on

110
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
So let's see, there is also an
anniversary coming.

111
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Are you going to do any video for it?

112
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Yep.

113
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Yep.

114
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
We've got Dan and at least Dan and I
reached out to pixel as well to do some

115
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
videos.

116
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
So, so Andy's got a big list that he went
through.

117
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I believe Angie and him curated it.

118
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
And we were looking through it last week
to figure out what we could do and what we

119
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
could refresh.

120
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
So, yep, there'll be some things coming
out soon.

121
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
That'll be good.

122
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Some new content, I guess you could say.

123
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Yeah, don't we need to give Yuri some
ERGs for a cake, kushti, isn't that

124
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
tradition?

125
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Sorry, cake?

126
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Don't we need to give Yuri some ERGs for
cake?

127
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,000
No, it's not Yuri, it's who's the guy
that we give money to for a cake?

128
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
In Gulag.

129
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Oh, that's Raro.

130
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Yeah, Raro.

131
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Don't we need to give Raro money for
cake?

132
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
He usually gets a cake if we give him
some ERGs and then sends us pictures.

133
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
We've got to remember to do that.

134
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
He celebrates it every year that I
remember with a cake.

135
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
So we'll make sure to do maybe a hop and
gulag in a little bit and send him some

136
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
ERGs.

137
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Nice.

138
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Yeah.

139
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
So that's, that's going to be great.

140
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
A lot of video content that you should be
seeing up on YouTube.

141
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I don't think, when's the anniversary
exactly, kushti?

142
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
What day?

143
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
July 1st.

144
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Yeah.

145
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
July 1st.

146
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
So that is June, July.

147
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
That's two days before our AMA.

148
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:27,000
So maybe, maybe we move the AMA to the
first and kick it off, kushti.

149
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Possible.

150
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Yeah.

151
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
That'd be interesting.

152
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Yeah, kick off the video sequences with a
live AMA on the first, and then let the

153
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
videos run the rest of the day on release.

154
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
That might be a good idea.

155
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Cool.

156
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Great.

157
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Yeah.

158
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
What else?

159
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
We've been talking to Glasgow.

160
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
All the details have been sent to the
listing.

161
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
So congratulations on everybody for
fundraising at the raffle for the US

162
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
on-ramp.

163
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
That's going to be great, except for
three states.

164
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Unfortunately, New York, I'll have to
enter someplace else, but that's fine.

165
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
So all the details have been sent there.

166
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
The agent that they're working with has
said it takes a few weeks to bring back

167
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
the finalized contract.

168
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
From there, so we should be seeing it
soon.

169
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I'm hoping hoping maybe near the end of
July We'll see that on ramp fully

170
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
functional where people can hop in and not
only I'm excited about that on ramp.

171
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I'm excited that There's potential to
integrate that puppy into things.

172
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
So how cool would it be to?

173
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
On ramp right from Nautilus or on ramp
right from Rosen Bridge in there That's

174
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
really what I'm excited about, you know
ease of use for people

175
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
as opposed to going to their interface.

176
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
What else we have?

177
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Last weekend was Father's Day.

178
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Happy Father's Day to everybody that is a
father.

179
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
So I didn't show up to the SIGS meeting.

180
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I was spending time with the family.

181
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
So we did not finalize the schedule for
the Ergo meetup, but that should be done

182
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
this Sunday.

183
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
We'll finalize that puppy, and we'll pump
it out there along with the two more

184
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
sign-up links, the GitHub sign-up link and
the Google Form sign-up link.

185
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,000
So you guys can sign up and come but as I
said the weeks before

186
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
we are doing a we're going to try to live
stream as much as we can to involve the

187
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
people that can't be there right so we're
going to live stream all the talks we're

188
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
going to live stream the hackathon we're
going to try to involve the people allow

189
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
groups outside of the place to that are
streaming to participate in the hackathon

190
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
as well so we'll have two groups in person
one of the AI coders one of the core dev

191
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
coders or the original coders

192
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
And then we'll have two groups online,
which are the AI coders and another group

193
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
of manual, original coders.

194
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
So that'll be good to involve that.

195
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
It'll be a whole production.

196
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
We can't live stream you dinner, so we're
really sorry about that.

197
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I guess we could, but it wouldn't be too
tasty.

198
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
So stay tuned for that.

199
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
That'll be a good event as well that
everybody can watch from the comforts of

200
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
your couch if you're not going to make the
way over to sunny Colorado.

201
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Always sunny, sometimes Colorado.

202
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Isn't that what Charles says all the
time?

203
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Something like that.

204
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Yeah, so that'll be fun.

205
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
What else?

206
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Rosen Bridge is nearing their Doge
integration.

207
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
They got through some tough stuff that
was taking them a while to figure out.

208
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
So that should be imminent for those of
you watching that.

209
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Guards are locked and ready, ready to
update and push that through.

210
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
So if you're a watcher, please stay tuned
to that.

211
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Any updates that are needed, please do
that periodically.

212
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,000
And let me remind everybody running
watchers or guards, it's not

213
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
It's a good idea to check in on it once
in a while.

214
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I try to check in once a week when I fix
my USD Oracle.

215
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I try to check on my watch or my guard to
make sure that it's running and as a

216
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
safety I usually bounce it.

217
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
because there have been some times when
I'm running the watch or running the guard

218
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
where the health looks okay, the health
looks fine, but then I bounce it and all

219
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
of a sudden one of my chains is, you know,
100 or 200 or 300 blocks, maybe even a

220
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
thousand blocks out of sync, you know, way
more blocks than it took to bounce the

221
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
thing.

222
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
It's perfectly healthy.

223
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Just bounce your guard once in a while.

224
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Bounce your watcher once in a while, just
on the safe side.

225
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Set your alarm.

226
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
If you're going to, if you plant
something outside to grow, you don't just

227
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
leave it and forget it, right?

228
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
You've got to put a little water on it,
that kind of stuff.

229
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
So give us some TLC and you'll make sure
to get all the transactions you can

230
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
instead of missing them with an out of
sync watcher.

231
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
What else we got, kushti?

232
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Actually, just some thoughts.

233
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:53,000
It's quite amazing how AI coding on Ergo
is being developed, right?

234
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:58,000
So it seems like crazy, quick progress.

235
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:04,000
So I'm not quite following all the

236
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,000
possibilities here but yeah it's quite
amazing so I think Ergo is actually quite

237
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,000
friendly right to AI extremely friendly
the endpoints make it so easy and the

238
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,000
tools like even with the Python
integration just you know writing a quick

239
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,000
AI thing to integrate with that it's it's
easy

240
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Yeah, and also ErgoScript, I think, well,
and the approach, right, so yeah, it

241
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:39,000
should be very AI-friendly.

242
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Then, yeah, so for Rosen, yeah, well, I
asked Joe directly, like yesterday, maybe

243
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:51,000
even two days ago,

244
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:59,000
About Zano and Kaspa, so yeah, it seems
they're in touch, right?

245
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,000
But yeah, well, it depends on the teams
how quickly integrations will be done, but

246
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,000
yeah, let's see.

247
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Kaspa just launched a mixer last week.

248
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Did you see that, kushti?

249
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:21,000
No, not quite but yeah, it seems it's
it's like bitcoin bitcoin like like

250
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:28,000
coinjoin rights approach the mixer the the
mixer, right?

251
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
So yeah, it's not really Kaspa.

252
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
It's it's it's hosted essentially Yeah,
it's hosted on their end.

253
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
So I wonder how that's going to work and
they have

254
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
And they had what I read while I was
reading through the thing you have to

255
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
agree to before you mix.

256
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
And one of the lines was, we cannot
guarantee privacy or tracking of that kind

257
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
of thing.

258
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
So we can guarantee anonymity.

259
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
So I was like, oh, that's interesting.

260
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Maybe they'll work on it and figure it
out and figure out how to make a

261
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
non-custodial self-download one like Ergo
has.

262
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
That kind of stuff is, you know, given,
but it's a good start.

263
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:16,000
But actually, yeah, so they cannot, I
think, in the first place because for

264
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:23,000
coinjoin, like mixers, so... Well, the
biggest issue is networking layer, right?

265
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,000
So that there is some service you need to
work with, right, in order to coordinate

266
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,000
mixing efforts with other platforms.

267
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I gotcha.

268
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:43,000
and yeah usually yeah what surveillance

269
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:48,000
is doing like specific agencies and so
on, so they're tracking interactions with

270
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,000
those services specifically, right?

271
00:18:53,000 --> 00:19:00,000
And it's not something which could be
avoided by the services, right?

272
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
They don't control networking layer.

273
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:09,000
So yeah, well, in case of

274
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:17,000
working with our Ergo node, Monero node,
right?

275
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
It's quite different.

276
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:26,000
So, yeah, well, in Ergo, it's service,
but you're working with some nodes, right?

277
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:33,000
But your own node, and then, yeah, it's
more controllable at least.

278
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Could be made better, but yeah, I mean,

279
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:44,000
In Monero, actually, it seems based on
available information, it's also kind of

280
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:53,000
the weakest part of the security chain.

281
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Well, the networking layer, so if you're
working with, so especially if you're

282
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:06,000
using Tor along with Monero, right, so
well, it seems certain agencies are trying

283
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:12,000
to connect interactions with Tor with
transactions on Monero based on some

284
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:18,000
incidents.

285
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,000
which took place in EU, for example.

286
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:36,000
So, yeah, then maybe it's better to avoid
using Tor even, right?

287
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:42,000
But then, yeah, you are going to somehow

288
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Make private communication on your own.

289
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:58,000
It's very tricky, especially without
knowledge.

290
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:08,000
So, yeah, well, privacy guarantees is a
very tricky point, actually.

291
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Even if there are some on-chain
guarantees, then, yeah, well, it's not

292
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
just about that.

293
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
True, very true.

294
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
And yeah, about those services.

295
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:30,000
So yeah, well, I don't have any
information about Kaspa, but for Bitcoin,

296
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:38,000
those services were under close
surveillance even back in early 2020.

297
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:45,000
So yeah, I had some talks about that with
some

298
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Well, research labs doing this, actually.

299
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Yeah, I mean, they're always...

300
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Sorry, go for it.

301
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:05,000
So yeah, tracking activities and yeah,
well, doing

302
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Well, on-chain transactions with
off-chain activities like communication

303
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:23,000
with state service.

304
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Oh boy.

305
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:31,000
It sounds like it's always...

306
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
It's always a struggle to attain that
perfectly.

307
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I mean, even with a perfectly designed
system, with a knowledgeable user, you're

308
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:44,000
still at risk of exposing yourself if
you're not careful, even no matter how

309
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,000
perfect something like ErgoMixer is or
other things.

310
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:54,000
but if you're working with your own notes
and mixer and yeah for sure for sure but

311
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,000
i'm talking about the simple things as far
as like cross-pollinating a clean wallet

312
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:04,000
or something stupid like that like how the
bridge chain guy was caught with the nfts

313
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,000
mixing his funds he just made a stupid
mistake pollinating a wallet the wrong way

314
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,000
and then it's over you know just

315
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,000
user error, nothing to do with the mixer
really just screwed it up.

316
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,000
So I think there's plenty of ways to
expose yourself even with a pretty solid

317
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,000
system.

318
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:36,000
I mean, using your code, then, yeah,
well, it's two connections.

319
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Like, one or two connections.

320
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Something, but, yeah.

321
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I mean, the point is, if you're having
collections, then it's supposed to

322
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:09,000
the opt-in info, which started a certain
well, according to some.

323
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:17,000
So that's better to avoid thing just by
transaction.

324
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:28,000
So then they will start in case of

325
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
kushti, you're breaking up a little bit.

326
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:34,000
You want to switch internet connections?

327
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
You hear me?

328
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Let's see.

329
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Yep.

330
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Hopefully he switches internet
connections.

331
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Andy, you're still there?

332
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
We're still live?

333
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Yeah.

334
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Okay.

335
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
All right.

336
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
So what kushti gets his internet
connection fixed.

337
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Let's see if we can hit some questions in
the meantime.

338
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Let's see if there are non-kushti
questions here.

339
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Oh, yeah, well what kushti was saying as
well when I was breaking up and what we

340
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:10,000
were talking about is No matter how fit
the protocol is There's still user methods

341
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,000
that can expose you on mixers, right?

342
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:20,000
And he was speaking of the type of mixers
that Oh, there is gone.

343
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
See if Andy fixes me.

344
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
There we go.

345
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
We'll go we'll bend down like this

346
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
And even if there are, you know, pretty
fit mixers, like the ErgoMixer, where it

347
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,000
hosts on your own machine, you send the
stuff out through your own node, there are

348
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
still ways, not protocol-based, that can,
you know, expose you.

349
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
And there have been examples that are
already on the chain of people trying to

350
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
hide themselves and messing up, not
mixer-based, not mixer-related.

351
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Based on that they just were sloppy in
doing it and didn't really understand what

352
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:59,000
the function of a mixer works or how it
works So so there's that kind of stuff you

353
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:06,000
got to be careful with as well Let's see
we have Somebody asked about the

354
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Most body max fitness

355
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:16,000
We talked about this earlier when we
started BodyMax, talked to Glasgow.

356
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:21,000
It should be about a few weeks.

357
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,000
They have all the information and they're
sending back the contract soon and that

358
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,000
should be signed and good.

359
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
So I'd give it, I can set up again.

360
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Great.

361
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
I'd give it a few weeks.

362
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
So it's open probably the end of July.

363
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
We should see something like that come
forward.

364
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,000
So looking forward to that What else do
we have?

365
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
You guys like my visualizer in the back.

366
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:50,000
This was a quick AI coding thing It shows
the mempool you can click on you can click

367
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,000
on a thing and it shows you the actual
transaction orange or peer-to-peer

368
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:00,000
transactions yellow are

369
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Gold oracle transactions.

370
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,000
You can see all the gold there It's just
something cool that I have up During the

371
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,000
day so I can see how busy the Ergo chain
is And the matrix out the green supposed

372
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,000
to represent hash And I hope to actually
connect it to the SIGS mining pool so we

373
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,000
can actually get a reading of those
outputs And do that.

374
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
All right, move it on.

375
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Let's see.

376
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:30,000
What else we have We have

377
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
A body max fitness looks like he's upset.

378
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
We'll come back to that stuff.

379
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,000
And he needs on the launch of sigma
quest.

380
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,000
I believe that is another thing to Timur
the game.

381
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
I don't have any update on that.

382
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,000
I think he was working on patching a hole
before release, so last time I knew he was

383
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,000
still working on that to patch it.

384
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
You know, that is one of the issues with,
I will say, I notice with AI coding, when

385
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,000
you're doing pure AI coding, it takes a
lot longer to fix something that AI codes

386
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,000
than it does if you wrote it yourself.

387
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:10,000
I use AI a bit at work to program my Perl
scripts to build some and I know it takes

388
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:15,000
time to build it from scratch, but if I go
back to something that I didn't build and

389
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:20,000
I'm looking at it and trying to fix it for
an error or a bug or anything like that,

390
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
it takes me a considerable amount of time
to figure out exactly what the hell is

391
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
going on.

392
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
So I imagine that's something similar
that Timur is going through right now,

393
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
depending on his coding skill, with
looking at that and trying to fix

394
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
something that somebody else built,
especially when it was AI-coded, that kind

395
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
of stuff.

396
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
So, yeah.

397
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
kushti, welcome back.

398
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
You switching internet connections?

399
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Yeah, not yet.

400
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
You seem to be pretty good right now, but
I see your eyes Maybe I'll switch over my

401
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
eyes to until Andy fixes us.

402
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Let's see kushti here.

403
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Let me let me join you in the in the
broadcast Here we go There we go kushti

404
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:10,000
now we're twinsies now it looks
intentional Perfect.

405
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
I kushti we got some questions.

406
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
You ready?

407
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Yep.

408
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Yep.

409
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
All right.

410
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Here's the one from Luke Gratesmith.

411
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,000
It's getting very, very out of the
blockchain.

412
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Ready?

413
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
What subject did you all like best when
you were in school and what subject do you

414
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
like best to do with your free time now if
you want to learn something?

415
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
You first, kushti.

416
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Oh, but I don't have free time, so
usually, yeah, I mean, when having free

417
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,000
time, would be happy to actually catch
with some stuff in cryptography, so a lot

418
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:46,000
of things going on.

419
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:55,000
And yeah, well, for some topics, I'm well
out of state of arts.

420
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
What about when you went to school?

421
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Back in the day, kushti, when you were a
youngin?

422
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Well, mathematics, physics, something
like that.

423
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:08,000
All right.

424
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Oh, there we go.

425
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Andy's awake.

426
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Andy's fixing us.

427
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Thank you, Andy.

428
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Let me fix me as well.

429
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Sorry, one second.

430
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Center me up here.

431
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
There we go.

432
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
OK, perfect.

433
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,000
All right, my favorite subject in school?

434
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:38,000
You know, I was a music student in
school, so that always came naturally.

435
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
That was my favorite subject.

436
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:46,000
And then I started dabbling in Java
programming, which also came easily.

437
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
So that was a lot of fun.

438
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Just able to kind of hyper-focus on that
stuff.

439
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
So I'd say those two.

440
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
And music history was fun as well.

441
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:01,000
We used to do fun drop needle tests on
every single piece of music that's ever

442
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:06,000
been written, all the way from Gregorian
chants up to, you know, the Renaissance or

443
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:11,000
even probably the 1800s, early 1900s.

444
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
So those are fun drop needle tests where
you just sit there and you drop a needle

445
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
on a random record and you get points
Whoever guessed the composer or the era of

446
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,000
it.

447
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
I think you had to guess both at the same
time Well, I guess if you see the

448
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
composer, you know the era but but yeah,
so so that was a lot of fun

449
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Now, in my free time, how do I like to
learn?

450
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:38,000
I come from the school of bash your head
against it until you get it, right?

451
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,000
I have a small patience for reading
things thoroughly.

452
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:48,000
So if there's documentation on something,
I'll try my best to skim through it before

453
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:54,000
my attention just starts going off to the
wayside and just losing interest.

454
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,000
So I'll do my best to try to read up it
to get a general idea of it, and then I'll

455
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,000
try to utilize it and beat my head against
it until I figure it out.

456
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
So that seems to be my method of learning
throughout life, and it seems to be

457
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
alright.

458
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:11,000
I notice that it does leave holes in my
knowledge, so while I will be able to do

459
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:16,000
something and seem somewhat masterful in
something that I do,

460
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,000
It still leaves pretty big holes in there
kind of thing.

461
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
So that is one of the weaknesses of it
But it's a method that seems to work so

462
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,000
far for for what I'm doing Yeah, good
question Luke non blockchain related.

463
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
I like it All right.

464
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Let's see what else we have

465
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Bevis asks, any updates on Kraken listing
for Rosen-ERG?

466
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Has voting finished?

467
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Yeah, let me tell you about this, buddy.

468
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
I have, what's it called?

469
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Let me see, can I bring this up on the
screen?

470
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
I think I can.

471
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Let's see.

472
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Can you guys see?

473
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Let me move myself for one second.

474
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
I can remove myself for this fancy stuff.

475
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
There you go.

476
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Look at that, folks.

477
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Zero comments.

478
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,000
I invited the community last week to come
comment on this stuff.

479
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Right now, the only person that's
commented is in the lower left right here.

480
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,000
right there, it's been CannonQ, who's a
Sigmanaut, right?

481
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
So he has vested interest because he's
part of the, you know, he's Sigmanaut in

482
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
the Sigmanauts type of guard set.

483
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
But my goodness, people, I invited the
community to comment on that stuff and

484
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
nobody's commented it.

485
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
So it's interesting where I see people
show interest in chats and show interest

486
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
right now in, you know, the AMA.

487
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:40,000
I'm not dissing you, Bevis, not at all,
you know, I'm just saying in general.

488
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Please take that interest and take it off
chats and take it to the actual Paideia

489
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
and comment on the thing.

490
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Even if it's like, this looks great,
let's go.

491
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,000
You know, that's much better than seeing
zero comments on the thing.

492
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Then we know, okay, we've got 30 people
that said, great, let's go.

493
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Then we'll turn it into a vote and we'll
push it.

494
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
You know what I mean?

495
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Engage, please guys.

496
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
We can't rely on other people to engage
for us.

497
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Even if something looks good and you
agree to it Don't rely on that Don't be

498
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,000
passive be active, please.

499
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Great.

500
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Thanks for bringing that up Bevis All
right.

501
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Oh, here's a good one from Luca Chinese
stablecoin.

502
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Do you think it'd be worth creating an
RMB stablecoin?

503
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Maybe, I don't know.

504
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
What's the demand?

505
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:33,000
But yeah, I guess it could be some,
right?

506
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,000
I mean, there's some nationalistic aspect
there, right?

507
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Where Chinese citizens might be more apt
to convert to your Chinese stablecoin as

508
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,000
opposed to a US dollar stablecoin, no?

509
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:54,000
I don't know, but usually RMB, to the
best of my knowledge, is tied to USD

510
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:03,000
anyway, but sometimes the rate is changed.

511
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:18,000
But over the years, from my observations,
it's anywhere around 6 or 7 CNY to USD.

512
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
6, 6.28 probably.

513
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:26,000
But yeah, I don't know.

514
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:34,000
So maybe it makes sense if it will be
more independent, right?

515
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Well, how do you feel about the latest
craze, kushti?

516
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,000
It seems like the latest craze is
corporations creating their own

517
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,000
stablecoins lately, and I imagine that's
going to either fizzle out or go full

518
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,000
steam ahead for the remainder of this

519
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
This market kind of thing.

520
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
What are your thoughts about having an
Amazon stablecoin or a Walmart stablecoin

521
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
or something like that?

522
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:03,000
So, that's a bit expected, right, to me
at least.

523
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:11,000
So, well, as I say, it's in regards with
ChainCash, not once even.

524
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Well, we are back to free banking era,
right, in one way or another.

525
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:27,000
So, this also quite following the trend.

526
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,000
I don't know, I guess free banking in the
sense that anybody can do it, but I think

527
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
engaging in something like the Walmart
stablecoin or the Amazon stablecoin, I

528
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,000
don't think there's anything free about
that, man.

529
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:41,000
I imagine there will be some serious
guardrails and restrictions on some of

530
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,000
that stuff.

531
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Yeah, but that's the first step, right?

532
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
So, well, it was started by Tether,
right?

533
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,000
But if Tether is doing billions on
stablecoins, then yeah, you can expect...

534
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,000
That's true, that is true.

535
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
It's a tasty fruit hanging there.

536
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Literally every corporation is chasing
billions as well, right?

537
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Because that's how it works.

538
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Then, yeah, well, in regards with Chinese
stablecoins, yeah, I think, well, Chinese

539
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:28,000
corporations also will jump on the board,
especially considering, well,

540
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:36,000
how developed fintech they are right with
Alipay and other companies so yeah

541
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:44,000
actually a lot of big fintech corporations
are now there and yeah well they also

542
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:52,000
expanding I believe to Southeast Asia at
least and so on so

543
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Africa also.

544
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:02,000
So then, yeah, probably makes a lot of
sense.

545
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:07,000
And yeah, especially when they see Tether
doing billions, then yeah, well, it's

546
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:12,000
quite natural to chase this path.

547
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
That's true.

548
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,000
All right, we've got Bevis again with a
good question.

549
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:21,000
kushti, giving you a good runway here.

550
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Can we expect sub-blocks to be fully
deployed by the end of this year?

551
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
That's six months away, kushti.

552
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
What's your thought?

553
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Probably.

554
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
That's good.

555
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Probably.

556
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
That's a good answer.

557
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Good enough, kushti.

558
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Let's move on.

559
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Yes.

560
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:42,000
So I think we can start injecting

561
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:51,000
sub-blocks, supporting nodes to the
public testnet around somewhat July even.

562
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:57,000
But then, yeah, a lot of things to take
care about.

563
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:02,000
And yeah, so some weeks and months it
will take.

564
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:09,000
And yeah, actually, it makes sense to
activate

565
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:14,000
sub-blocks after 6.0 activation right but
yeah can be done before maybe even with

566
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:19,000
but

567
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
No, I'm not sure about that.

568
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
So, yeah, probably after 6.0 activation.

569
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,000
So, yeah, if we will start voting on July
1st, for example, then activation will

570
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,000
take place on October 1st.

571
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:39,000
But then, yeah, well, in somewhat October
even, we can do Mainnet activation.

572
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Let's see.

573
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Awesome.

574
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
All right.

575
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Follow-up question.

576
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Any updates on Rosen going live with
Doge?

577
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,000
I think I spoke with that earlier when we
first started.

578
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Update from Joe is a work in progress.

579
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
It should be soon, hopefully.

580
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
So we're getting there.

581
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
We are getting there.

582
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:03,000
What else do we have?

583
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:09,000
We got some semi-spam here, frustrations
being expressed.

584
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:17,000
How are BRIC going from Earth to Miner?

585
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Kids are gone.

586
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Students are gone for the summer.

587
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
We have high school students here.

588
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
So we have a program where there's high
school students that come here, about 80

589
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
of them.

590
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,000
In our program and they spend time on
Like a 10 week 12 week architecture

591
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,000
program.

592
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,000
There are also some other small classes
that take place in the summer Like the

593
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,000
master students come to a facility in New
York City.

594
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,000
So those guys will be getting BRIC soon
But I'm not gonna give the high school

595
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
students BRIC.

596
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
I mean, I guess

597
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,000
That'd be interesting, but they don't
plot, unfortunately, so there'd be no real

598
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,000
point to giving them BRIC.

599
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
But we'll see.

600
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Every year they kind of enhance what
the...

601
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
what's it called, what the high school
students are doing.

602
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
So when the first year they came, first
time they came like years ago, they never

603
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
even used computers.

604
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
It was all like hand drawing and that
kind of thing.

605
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Now they're using laptops and they're
using Rhinoceros and AutoCAD and those

606
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,000
kinds of things and printing some things,
usually tiling.

607
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:22,000
So it wouldn't be out of the world to
have them start plotting big time.

608
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
So if that happens, potentially we will
hand them BRIC and ask for the department

609
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,000
to pay for it essentially.

610
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
So give us funds.

611
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Here's the BRIC.

612
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Students can print via the blockchain
since they don't have a Bursar account.

613
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,000
So actually, BRIC's a perfect thing for
that kind of transaction.

614
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
So we'll see.

615
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
We'll see in the summertime.

616
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
But yeah, we're gearing up.

617
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:43,000
We've changed our rules a little bit for
next semester for how BRIC are handed out.

618
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:47,000
And we'll hit it full force when it comes
in.

619
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Mark the shark says qx doesn't read my
messages.

620
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Oh, did he send me a message?

621
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Let me see.

622
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:57,000
I wonder what I I am bad at reading
messages How many unread messages you have

623
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:01,000
are so many kushti?

624
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Yeah, so Sometimes yeah, i'm finding some
messages from like weeks ago.

625
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Yeah, whoops Sorry, sorry Mark.

626
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
I'm not sure what you're commenting.

627
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Maybe you're commenting on

628
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Maybe you're commenting on the AI coding
stuff.

629
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Maybe you're that Mark.

630
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Mark's big thing with AI coding is
context, context, context.

631
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
You have to give the AI code, you have to
give the LLM context about what you're

632
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
doing, how to do it.

633
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,000
And he says it does worlds, worlds
better, right?

634
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
It's night and day difference between AI
coding with no context and AI coding with

635
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
context.

636
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:45,000
take be like Mark give your LLM context
and You'll be very happy.

637
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Oh, yeah, he's commenting that I don't
read documentation.

638
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Yeah, I don't sorry.

639
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Sorry, buddy QX show is the mempool
visualizer sir show us I did didn't I show

640
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:58,000
you guys it's right here kushti did I show
you here?

641
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,000
I'll show it again for people that joined
late real quick.

642
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Let me hide myself one sec

643
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Let me take a screen capture.

644
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Let me make it smaller so it can actually
be seen fully on screen.

645
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,000
There we go.

646
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,000
So, let's see.

647
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Oh, as soon as I do it, the mempool
clears up.

648
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
We'll put, we'll put it back on until
the, until we get some hits with some

649
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
mempools coming up.

650
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
But, let me know when that happens.

651
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
All right.

652
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
What else do we have?

653
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Oh, here we go.

654
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Yeah.

655
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,000
First of all, this is a topic that was
that was had in chat the other day.

656
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Can you talk about the concept of a
private DEX?

657
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Can this help with avoiding something
like a sandwich bot or snipers?

658
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:53,000
But I mean it depends on how you define
private here.

659
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
So how would you do that?

660
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Would you whitelist addresses to work
with a smart contract essentially?

661
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:04,000
So you can whitelist, for example,
off-chain batchers, right?

662
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:12,000
And encrypted requests, for example,
right?

663
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
that they can do something.

664
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:21,000
There was some design of private
perpetual DEX proposed recently, but this

665
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:28,000
is about actually some centralized server
providing some proof of something, but

666
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:35,000
this server is actually controlling

667
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:41,000
So, actually doing sniping and MEV and
whatever, right?

668
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:48,000
So, well, at least now such things are
transparent, but so trackable.

669
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,000
But yeah, it's easy to introduce
something centralized, but yeah,

670
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,000
quasi-private.

671
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,000
And then, yeah, well, a certain entity
will do that, right, without even being

672
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,000
traced.

673
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:10,000
So, the devil is in detail, how privacy
is defined exactly, right?

674
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Well, definitions are quite subtle.

675
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:19,000
So, kushti, how is a sandwich bot
successful on a UTXO chain, and especially

676
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:23,000
with a block time of two minutes on Ergo?

677
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
So I guess you hit the slippage or, I
mean, it's not like you can pack something

678
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
before and in the same transaction, right?

679
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Like how do you, how does sandwich bots
work successfully?

680
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
I thought they were much more difficult
to do.

681
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Not the same, but yeah, you can do, so if
slippage is long, you can do separate

682
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:44,000
transactions, right?

683
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,000
And your pool puts a little bit higher
fee.

684
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:55,000
So it's not quite different here, right,
with AMM.

685
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Then, yeah, well.

686
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:03,000
There are different things you can do,
but yeah, they also probably are not quite

687
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:08,000
different here, right?

688
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:14,000
But yeah, so for private DEX, well, for
most of efficient designs, right, so you

689
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:20,000
adjust

690
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:27,000
tying to some batchers and sending them
encrypted requests.

691
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:32,000
But then what?

692
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:41,000
So then they can do some commitments,
right?

693
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:45,000
So I need to think actually how it could
work.

694
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,000
But yes, something is possible when you
fix batchers.

695
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:55,000
But then the question is, do you really
want such a design?

696
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Okay.

697
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Hard to say.

698
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:01,000
I mean, it's about different trade-offs.

699
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:06,000
So if it's about, I don't know, the truly
decentralized setting, then the question

700
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:11,000
is, well, what kind of privacy are you
trying to achieve here?

701
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:17,000
I mean, public privacy from home and
privacy.

702
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:23,000
So if it's about privacy of your actions,
then yeah.

703
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
How are they clear?

704
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,000
How are they executed?

705
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Okay, so currently the way for the
community to avoid these sandwich attacks,

706
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:38,000
if they're being happening, is to set your
slippage just to a low amount and that'll

707
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:43,000
just, your transaction will fail, but is
that the key?

708
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Right, but actually you can avoid proxy
contracts, like Spectrum DEX is doing, for

709
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:59,000
example.

710
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:10,000
So in Dexy, for example, the current DEX
interface for Dexy,

711
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:15,000
which is a part of Spectrum DEX.

712
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
So there is no proxy, right?

713
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:24,000
And then, well, there is no sandwiching
possible, right?

714
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:30,000
It's not possible to insert any order
before.

715
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:35,000
But then, yeah, you can have transactions
failed, but without on-chain footprint,

716
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:40,000
unlike EVM blockchains.

717
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Right, right.

718
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
We're not losing any funds.

719
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,000
So yeah, well, the current design with
proxies is maybe not very Ergo-oriented,

720
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:50,000
right?

721
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,000
So maybe direct execution is better.

722
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,000
There are some discussions in the chats
about that.

723
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,000
But even if you are doing

724
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Proxy, for example, you can set, software
can set slippage to avoid any order

725
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:14,000
appearing before you, right, going in the
same direction.

726
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:22,000
So you can allow only four orders going
in opposite direction.

727
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:28,000
For example, then, yeah, I mean, still
there is chance of failure.

728
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:36,000
But maybe direct execution is better.

729
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Just so, and even so you can have more
sophisticated software, maybe which can

730
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:54,000
retry right attempts, but use direct
execution.

731
00:49:54,000 --> 00:50:00,000
And then for sandwiches, it would be
quite hard environment.

732
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Still, I believe.

733
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,000
All right, what else we got?

734
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Mark wants to know if we have an EIP for
creating side merge mined chains.

735
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Would that be a good way to codify the
process for others to follow?

736
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Sorry?

737
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Is there an EIP for sidechains, for merge
mined chains?

738
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,000
And if not, is that something that can be
done so other people can try to follow

739
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:32,000
this and help?

740
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Yeah, so there is only a document on how
to do a merge mined sidechain from

741
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:47,000
ErgoHack 8, maybe.

742
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Yeah, it was 8, I believe.

743
00:50:50,000 --> 00:51:02,000
So yeah, from autumn... autumn 2023.

744
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:10,000
So, yeah, well, but you can do some more
detailed documents and, yeah, if there are

745
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:18,000
some guys with ideas on, well, merge mined
sidechains would be happy to cooperate

746
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:26,000
with and, yeah, well, expand the
documents.

747
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:39,000
But yeah, please refer to ErgoHack 8
submission in the first place.

748
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:43,000
And yeah, it was about merge mined
sidechains and also trustless pegging for

749
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:47,000
such.

750
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Okay, so in this case, it's possible to
do two-way trustless peg.

751
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,000
It seems so, which is quite, quite great,
right?

752
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:06,000
So something which is not possible in
Bitcoin still.

753
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:12,000
All right, we got one maybe that Bruno
Could answer How the stablecoins fit into

754
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:18,000
the ecosystem with the major fiat back
stablecoins would be BRICS be interested

755
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:24,000
in Gluon Gold Dexy the BRICS group, which
is what that's the BRICS is a group of

756
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:30,000
nations exploring stablecoin development.

757
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,000
So has has has

758
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Bruno ever thought to not just develop
protocols, but actually to do outreaches

759
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:43,000
and try to engage those kind of things at
that level.

760
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Bruno I know he said the other day that
you know somebody asked him how come

761
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:52,000
you're not making a front end for this and
he says my forte is just designing this

762
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:56,000
and and doing that the base of it and
somebody else can make the front end of it

763
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:00,000
so I imagine perhaps outreach and
front-facing and engagement might not be

764
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:04,000
his real house either for this kind of
stuff

765
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Right, but usually, anyway, so big
players are interested in centralized

766
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:17,000
stablecoins, right?

767
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Maybe it makes sense, but also due to
capital inefficiency, right, of solid

768
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:32,000
algorithmic stablecoins, which survived
over time, right?

769
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:40,000
But then you can use such stablecoins in
conjunction with centralized stablecoins.

770
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
So do something like ChainCash, right?

771
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:46,000
So have multiple issuers backed in
different ways, even together along with

772
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Amazon and Google, right?

773
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:55,000
You can imagine them as well, just
different issuers in ChainCash along with

774
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:59,000
smaller players, right?

775
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Even individuals.

776
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:08,000
So in this regard, yeah, well, ChainCash
is kind of a great equalizer.

777
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:12,000
And then, yeah, well, algorithmic
stablecoins also can be used for some,

778
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:16,000
well,

779
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Settlements, right, some buffer, right,
which you maybe don't need for usually, so

780
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:37,000
you need for smaller amounts, but yeah,
it's better to have less trust also, more

781
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:47,000
guarantees basically.

782
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Yeah.

783
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,000
All right.

784
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:52,000
We got one more kushti This is a very
difficult question might take you a while

785
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:56,000
to answer What's your favorite fruit?

786
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Favorite fruit What really yeah, Ursa
wants to know your favorite fruit Maybe

787
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:11,000
wants to send you a basket a fruit basket
kushti Do you eat kushti?

788
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:14,000
How often do you eat once a week?

789
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,000
No like you have time to eat

790
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Yeah, yeah, but about fruits, I don't
know.

791
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:26,000
Maybe mango, but... Oh, nice.

792
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Good call.

793
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
Yeah, yeah, mango's great.

794
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Peach, peach, yeah.

795
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Similar, similar.

796
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,000
I'm a fan of the... Something like that.

797
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,000
In the U.S. we call them limes, but in
South America they're just lemons.

798
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:43,000
The green, the green lemon, those are...
Oh, yeah.

799
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Limes.

800
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Oh, so good.

801
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Well, that's a good way
