1
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Good morning!

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Good morning, everybody.

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
We've got a surprise guest today.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
We need to thank Joe's dog for waking him
up early this morning and getting him onto

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
his couch.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Yeah.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
That's a good boy right there.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Yeah, so it seems Joe's dog is truly a
good dog.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
He works for the community, that's for
sure.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Joe, it's good to have you here.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
What's new?

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
We haven't seen you in forever.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Oh, yeah, these are kind of early in my
time, so I've been a little lazy, focused

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
elsewhere.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Let's see where to start.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Well, let's start talking about the Ergo
event that we're putting together.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So qx() and I have been talking for like
a year.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Get the Ergo community together, have a
meetup.

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
And so slowly we've been lining up
speakers.

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
We've got event space right now in the
process of getting a liquor license, and

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
so I'm hoping that we can put together a
nice day where we kind of cover some of

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
the development that's going on in the
ecosystems, the security assumption, the

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
idea behind the project, why it matters,
etc.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
You know, crypto conferences, they can be
pretty nice, right?

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
But they also can be kind of heavy on the
wallet.

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
That is true, especially if you're an
event host, right?

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Especially if you're a booth holder.

28
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Yeah, I get it.

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I mean, for a lot of them, it's their
business.

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
And I think a lot of events, you know,
they do a good job putting together a good

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
show.

32
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
But barrier of entry is something where,
I don't know, sometimes you see the same

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
people, which, you know, I guess is nice
in terms of like networking, marketing,

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
etc.

35
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,000
But I don't know, I think opening it up,
making the barrier to entry lower, we'll

36
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,000
try to get broadcast online and it looks
like we're going to get a nice lineup of

37
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,000
people that we don't always hear from in
the Ergo community.

38
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
MiGoreng is going to make it, sounds like
qx() is going to try to make it, Allison

39
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,000
is going to try to make it and I'm hoping
that when the time rolls around, we can

40
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,000
highlight some MVPs that people are
working on in the ecosystem, cover some

41
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,000
projects, the what, the why, get into why
this matters for a peer-to-peer network.

42
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
It would also be great to get some
content from other applications of people

43
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
that are further away.

44
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
DuckPools is a good example.

45
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Australia to Colorado is not exactly
quick, but it would be awesome to see more

46
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:20,000
content from at least that team.

47
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I think others as well.

48
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
With Rosen, let's see, you know, right
now we're working on Runes and Doge.

49
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Sadly, Doge has kind of been kicking our
ass because the nodes and, you know, the

50
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
explorers are pretty tight.

51
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It's got some crappy infrastructure, but
nobody cares because it's a meme.

52
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
It doesn't matter.

53
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Yeah.

54
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
How are discussions with new chains going
on?

55
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Zano, Kaspa and so on.

56
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Sure, there's been discussions between
our team.

57
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
We're trying to get them to understand
what Rosen is, why it matters.

58
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I think one unique, let's say, feature
set that Rosen offers is this ability to

59
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:10,000
have unilateral access for both the
network coin and then tokens on top of the

60
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,000
network with relatively clear security
assumptions.

61
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
You know, I've always thought the
structure of like markets and let's say

62
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
the crypto space was a little bit weird.

63
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
You know, it's kind of a gatekept thing
where, you know, you have people that

64
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
will, I don't know.

65
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It's like, let's delist Zcash, which has
really done some great work in terms of

66
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
research and cryptography and kind of like
the execution side.

67
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
And then it's like, hey, let's list fart
coin.

68
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,000
And that kind of tells you the incentives
and the alignment are screwy as hell.

69
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
But I do think that one thing that kind
of interests me with this idea of scaling

70
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Rosen into new environments is you do kind
of get this situation where you have

71
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
non-linear maintenance.

72
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
So as a single team, as we add chains,
chains will update periodically the hard

73
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
fork infrastructure.

74
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Every once in a while, we'll get
upgrades, etc.

75
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
And so the question has been, how do we
create the right incentives to where we

76
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
create external support for maintenance?

77
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
That's actually an interesting question
even with centralized exchanges a lot of

78
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
the times. Something we've ran into over
the years, I'm sure you know kushti has

79
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
some good stories about that where you
know suddenly something's in maintenance

80
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
mode and we're saying hey why is this in
maintenance mode and then we got to chase

81
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
down the engineers and you know what node
are you running and you know it's kind of

82
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
figure out what's going on.

83
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:10,000
So one thing I've been discussing with
MHS as well as MiGoreng and kind of our

84
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,000
own dev team is the idea of creating the
right incentive alignment, right, to where

85
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:22,000
it's like if, let's say, three, four years
ago, Ergo heard about this framework that

86
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,000
created cross-chain access.

87
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
What would it take for us to have the
right incentive to build it and maintain

88
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
it?

89
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Personally, I'm a fan of this idea of
taking a percentage of outbound

90
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,000
transactions from new chains and having
them set up some sort of, you know let's

91
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,000
say a Paideia structure on Ergo something
like that where you know if things are

92
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:00,000
properly maintained and functioning they
can potentially earn a percentage right

93
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,000
you know and that kind of creates like
this, I don't know, let's call it like a

94
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:12,000
future dividend based on their work based
on you know keeping everything live versus

95
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,000
the traditional access is, you know, you
have a series of meetings with, you know,

96
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,000
marketing and, managers that probably
even, I don't know.

97
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I'm going to say, don't know which end of
the hammer to use, but, how do you scale

98
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:38,000
that Joe without putting too much of
burden on the Rosen team or the guards,

99
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,000
you know, to keep it, are they keeping up
to date?

100
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Are we managing individual people?

101
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
It's a, it's better to maybe create like
dead DAOs on each chain and then have the

102
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
DAOs themselves.

103
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
And then you withhold money if the DAOs
aren't doing a good job.

104
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I think that, I think the simplest way to
streamline it would be to keep it on Ergo.

105
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
We have a lot of the tooling and also the
distribution cost is low, right?

106
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,000
So, you know, if you're talking about
paying people a regular transaction.

107
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
We have low transaction fees.

108
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Paideia is a nice structure in terms of
having something that's transparent and

109
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
community oriented.

110
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,000
So I think that's a good structure for
that.

111
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
If you create proper open standards,
which I think started, I do think that we

112
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
could improve the Rosen contribution
document.

113
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
But having that public kind of allows
open specifications that if people can

114
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
meet, then it's just a matter of review
test, which is its own friction point,

115
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
right?

116
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
It certainly makes the barrier of entry a
lot lower than the standard listing, which

117
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,000
is you sign a contract that says we can
delist you at any time for any reason, and

118
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
you need to meet these market metrics.

119
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Whether that's reality or not, you can
figure out how to plug that gap, which is

120
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
scammy as hell.

121
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,000
And then, you know, you also have this
idea that then you pass it to engineers

122
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,000
that you have no idea what you're actually
buying in terms of security, right?

123
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
The only time I've been able to
understand kind of the full exchange stack

124
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
and what's securing assets is after they
get hacked, right?

125
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
There's always a postmortem and say,
well, you know, our two or three multisig

126
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,000
failed and, you know, sorry, we've
suspended the thing and I don't know.

127
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
It's a weird thing.

128
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
You don't actually know what you're
getting into from a security perspective,

129
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
which is a terrible assumption, right?

130
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
You're signing a contract that says you
don't really get to see the security of

131
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
what you're buying, and we can delist you
at any time.

132
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Yeah.

133
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Also forget about privacy, about, yeah,
about everything basically.

134
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Yeah, really anything, anything that's
like valuable or disruptive, you know,

135
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
we're going to delist you and you know,
here's a, you know, after fart coin comes

136
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
fuck coin, right?

137
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Yeah, that's why I think fart coins are
very pleasant for them, right?

138
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:38,000
So they're not about any risks about
privacy.

139
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
So absolutely harmless farts basically.

140
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Yeah.

141
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
So, so I've, I've always like wished
there was some mechanism to say, okay,

142
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
well, you know, there's, there's a lot of
like, if you're a fair launch project,

143
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
right, you automatically launch in a
market that has a ton of friction where

144
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
you're basically not going to get listing
until you, you know, can pay whatever you

145
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
need to pay, right?

146
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
And, you know, there are some exchanges
that I've talked to that are like, Hey,

147
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
are you post a token generation event?

148
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:23,000
And I said, well, you know, we're, we're
a coin, not really a token.

149
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
What's your contract address, Joe?

150
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Yeah, and you know, well, we don't really
want to do that unless you're going to

151
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,000
give us like an internal allocation of,
you know, your supply.

152
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:41,000
It's like, oh, do you know how proof of
work works?

153
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:47,000
This idea of, you know, fair launched
cryptocurrencies.

154
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
We're in a weird space.

155
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
There's a lot of language, you know, I
don't know of any commodity in reality

156
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
where it's like, we had multiple seed
rounds, but we're, we're actually, you

157
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
know, the commodity, right?

158
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
It is what it is.

159
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:11,000
So how does that work with, I mean, let's
say, let's take Doge from that, right?

160
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
So let's say, you know, you're saying the
tooling isn't great, or the infrastructure

161
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
isn't great for Doge nodes and those kind
of things.

162
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
So that burden is going to go to the
guards, right?

163
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Every guard is going to have to figure
out what node they want to run, how

164
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
they're going to set it up, if they're
going to use a public one, if there's a

165
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
public one, or run their private.

166
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,000
But the question is, so when chains like,
let's say Doge, oh, yeah, yeah.

167
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
So, so with Doge, Doge is just kicking
our ass, right?

168
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
There's no other way to say it.

169
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Just cause you know, right?

170
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Rate limits are super strict.

171
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:52,000
So we actually had to design a new module
for a multi-resource backend.

172
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Right?

173
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Like Doge became like an engineering
challenge to say, okay, well, if we want

174
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
this, you know, to, to meet like the
specifications and expectations of all of

175
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
our other implementations, we're actually
going to have to do some special

176
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
engineering.

177
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:12,000
So we're all Doge devs now at the end of
the day.

178
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Is there a Doge DAO already, Joe?

179
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
No.

180
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
No, so my question, my question is, so,
you know, we're talking, you're talking

181
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
about exchanges delisting things and I can
understand.

182
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
You can see it both ways, right?

183
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
The cost effectiveness of keeping the
infrastructure and the security risks for

184
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
a chain that has very little movement
anymore is a risk for the exchange in

185
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
there.

186
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
But also you can see it as a money-making
endeavor, as the more the threat of

187
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
delisting is, the more the chain is going
to be used, the more money maybe the chain

188
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
will fork over to the CEX.

189
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
So I get both ways there.

190
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I look at it a little bit differently, to
be honest.

191
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I think that what's been happening in the
space is since the emergence of DeFi,

192
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:03,000
transaction volume has moved away from the
central exchanges and onto DEXes.

193
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
What happens is, if you look at the DEX
volume, five years ago versus today, the

194
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
growth curve on that is a magnitude higher
than the actual internal volume of

195
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
exchanges.

196
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:24,000
And so rather than saying, OK, well, we
can be entry points into these different

197
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:31,000
networks and they said, no, we're going to
try to directly compete.

198
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:38,000
And so then they start listing whatever
is popular for the day on DEXes.

199
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
And that's a losing proposition.

200
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
But the real interesting thing is going
to be just how rails change in the next

201
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
five years in our industry.

202
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
We're already starting to slowly see this
ability for people to move from their bank

203
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
to chains directly.

204
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:04,000
And at that point, I don't see much use
or utility for exchanges beyond

205
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:10,000
representing a mechanism to hold assets
for users.

206
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:16,000
They become a custodial venture rather
than more of an active trade engine

207
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:22,000
market, which even then, I don't know how
other than let's say liquidity that

208
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:28,000
they've already collected, I don't see why
they're any different than any other type

209
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:34,000
of OTC desk that people could potentially
go to.

210
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I think it's an old idea that hopefully,
at some point, is just less popular, and

211
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,000
things are turning that way.

212
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Well, yeah, I mean, you see these
exchanges going to more like their aim is

213
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
to keep the funds on the exchange.

214
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,000
So like making creating casino type of
things.

215
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Creating their own kind of side chains
and sub-chains to keep people on their

216
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
system.

217
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
So, yeah.

218
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
But my question I was trying to get to is
I feel like with the guards, you know, if

219
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
we're going to take a different approach
than central exchanges where we're looking

220
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
at each project individually, we're not
looking at the interoperability, we're not

221
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
looking about connecting everybody like
Rosen Bridge.

222
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
So I feel the guards in order to not say,
okay, if we onboard a chain and in two

223
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
years that chain starts having very little
transaction going through Rosen Bridge or

224
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
the chain itself is lower, do we look at
it as, okay, as a guard, this node is

225
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
quite a burden to run now considering
there's no money coming in to support

226
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
running that node.

227
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
And we're going to prune it, or do we
look at it as, OK, the collective of the

228
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
interoperability and the network we're
creating with Rosen balances out?

229
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Because we may have Ethereum, we may have
Cardano that's giving a lot of volume to

230
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Rosen to fund Rosen, to fund the guards,
to fund the watchers.

231
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
And that would take care of smaller
chains perhaps at the cost of losing that

232
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
balance of money there between the two.

233
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
But the benefit is that we're keeping
this network alive between all chains and

234
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
giving a fair shot.

235
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
So I'm wondering how that discussion is
going to go or how that mindset is going

236
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
to go among the guards or the watchers for
that kind of thing.

237
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Well, I think one thing that is a
constant disappointment in the crypto

238
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,000
space is that words don't really mean
anything, right?

239
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I've even been in meetings where they're
like, oh, you know, coins and tokens,

240
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
they're basically the same thing.

241
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
And it's like, yeah, they're just letters
for people to speculate on, which is

242
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
terrible for a peer-to-peer network.

243
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I do think that there's a lot of benefit
in trying to create an alignment for, I'm

244
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:05,000
not even going to say marketing, I'm just
going to say education, right?

245
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Because marketing, I don't know, talk is
cheap and execution is priceless on chain,

246
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
right?

247
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,000
So I do think there's a lot of things out
there that oftentimes people don't really

248
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,000
explore beyond the five-minute chart.

249
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
There's a mentality in the space that you
just look at the letters and they're all

250
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
kind of the same thing.

251
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
There's a variety of different assets.

252
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I would love to see more education, more
content, etc., long term, not just like

253
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,000
from within the Rosen team, but from kind
of the infrastructure around.

254
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Like if you're going to be a watcher on a
network, it's kind of value alignment for

255
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,000
you to talk about the what, the why, etc.

256
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Right?

257
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,000
And I do think that if you look at one of
the, I don't know, biggest failures of

258
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,000
education in the crypto industry, I would
say a lot of it is exchange, right?

259
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
They're the first point of like public
access.

260
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:24,000
And, you know, usually it's just garbage.

261
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Yeah, it's very interesting and to the
best of my knowledge quite unique thing,

262
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:42,000
right, to have those kind of deep in
products like Oracle pools, like Gold

263
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Oracle and Rosen Bridge network, right,
where people can, like everyone, right,

264
00:19:51,000 --> 00:20:00,000
can earn some tokens just by letting some
software run on a computer.

265
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:08,000
And that's, I think, still super
undervalued.

266
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Yeah, you know, kushti and Joe, we have a
ton of watchers, right?

267
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
We have hundreds of watchers out there
between the two chains or something like

268
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
that.

269
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
You'd think with that kind of amount of
people actively running machinery to

270
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,000
benefit a network, these people would be
the loudest mouthpieces out there, you

271
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
know, promoting cross-chain
interoperability, you know, preaching Ergo

272
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
to everybody, preaching Rosen Bridge.

273
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
But it's interesting, at what point can
we convince these people that the more

274
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
that they, you know, it's not just set and
forget with these kind of things.

275
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
You're running a tool that is directly
dependent on your participation and your

276
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
promotion of it.

277
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
So I hope to see that.

278
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I feel like it's somebody like baking
bread and selling it and never putting a

279
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,000
sign out of their shop that they're
selling bread kind of thing.

280
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:06,000
A lot of bridges in the crypto space are
designed to be optimistic to basically

281
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,000
offset computational cost.

282
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:16,000
And the idea with Rosen is let's move
computational costs to another layer,

283
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,000
spread it out across a set of actors, and
then create an incentive for them to run

284
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:26,000
that part of our system.

285
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,000
So yeah, I kind of look at it in my own
weird way as like your verification

286
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,000
mining, right?

287
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:43,000
And I would hope that as things take off,
that kind of grows in popularity because

288
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:49,000
it is something that as Rosen sees more
activity, hopefully those verification

289
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:55,000
miners earn more.

290
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I do know that one thing that we've done
that is not popular so far is we have

291
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
avoided stable coins.

292
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:12,000
And the reasoning behind that is if you
have a foundation that can be frozen,

293
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:20,000
seized, etc., you cannot really honestly
claim that it's backed one to one, right?

294
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Because that's subject to change at any
time based on, you know, the whims of a

295
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,000
central actor that you don't control.

296
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:37,000
That's something that, you know, people
do get pretty excited about this idea of

297
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,000
freeze and seize stables.

298
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
But I see that as one of the most like
underappreciated risks that's not really

299
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
priced in.

300
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
And I don't know.

301
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Let's see how that evolves as regulations
evolve.

302
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:01,000
But that's certainly a weird stack.

303
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:08,000
But then you can bring something like
USDM, right?

304
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Well, Zano has freedom USD, but yeah,
it's quite new.

305
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
It's a little weird.

306
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:25,000
So it could be risky, per se, because
most of such private stable coins failed.

307
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:35,000
There's a few problems on, yeah, just
because you have some boxes and so on.

308
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Yeah.

309
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,000
And you know, I would love to see Dexy
USD at some point.

310
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
You mean private version of it?

311
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
No, I mean, we're, we're going to launch
Dexy Gold, right?

312
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
And I think at some point we could update
the Oracle and.

313
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Let's see.

314
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:02,000
So tomorrow we'll have a call with Dan.

315
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
So yeah, let's see.

316
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:09,000
So what's our plans there in regards with
Dexy lithium and so on.

317
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Then, yeah, Dexy silver, need to get some
clarity here.

318
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:22,000
And then, yeah, Dexy USD, we can launch.

319
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:27,000
We need a little bit of inputs here.

320
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,000
It'd be good to see Dexy Gold in the wild
anyway, to be honest.

321
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Some managing efforts for the updated
Oracle pool and then launching Dexy USD.

322
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,000
It's quite straightforward, I believe.

323
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Just a different oracle and, yeah well
the contracts are the same basically. What

324
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:55,000
are the what are the chances of running
multiple data points on oracle 2.0 so that

325
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:01,000
the Dexy Gold people could also report USD
or no it's, it literally it has to be or

326
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:07,000
more security wise should be separate
oracle?

327
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:17,000
I don't know, it's actually hard to say
about security, but also if it will be a

328
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:24,000
gold pool also delivering USD, then yes,
USD bank to be updated.

329
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:33,000
But yeah, if we are going to update the
current USD pool to version two, then

330
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:41,000
yeah, well, that the bank can continue to
work with this.

331
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:56,000
So, yeah, it's probably better to update
the pool, right, to version two.

332
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Just that.

333
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
We'll update in the first place.

334
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
So yeah, please reach me if interested.

335
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Yeah, there is a telegram group on that
where we can now revive efforts to get

336
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Dexy USD and some.

337
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
All right.

338
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
So Joe, back to the meetup real quick.

339
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:31,000
We're almost we ran over everything again
in the Sigmanauts group, Joe kushti and

340
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:36,000
We've got mostly a finalized schedule, but
not quite to release it.

341
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:42,000
We might take one more stab at it on
Sunday And then put it out into the wild

342
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,000
along with the booth signups again as a
reminder But I'm excited.

343
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
It's gonna be fun.

344
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
I will try to, we're going to try to
stream as much as we can enjoy like what

345
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,000
you said about getting people like
DuckPools involved even though they're not

346
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,000
coming.

347
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:05,000
I think we create create a hybrid event
to where in between so for online people

348
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:10,000
there will be you know 12 hours of pure
conversation and pure presentations to the

349
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:15,000
people in person it'll be just the four or
five presentations that we do and in

350
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:20,000
between the spaces like when we do the
hike do the dinner do the lunch we can

351
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:25,000
have people like Kras come in and jump in
and do the online part presentation about

352
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,000
So I think that brings a good point that
we can probably try to do that.

353
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,000
So to the outside, if you are not at the
event, they'll have a good five, six,

354
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,000
seven hours of straight talking from Ergo
from those kinds of people.

355
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
So yeah, great point, Joe.

356
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
We'll try to get that to happen.

357
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
I would love to give open source
developers a platform to speak and address

358
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
the problem.

359
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
You know, it's, it's honest when you go
to a crypto event and it's like, okay,

360
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
well, what do you do?

361
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I've, you know, basically build open code
and then it's like, okay, well, you can

362
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,000
pay, you know, 10, 20, sometimes 30,000
for a booth.

363
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:10,000
That's not like the most exchange, but it
is what it is.

364
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Any luck you're still thinking about
coming?

365
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
We'll check in July.

366
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
July.

367
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Okay.

368
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
All right.

369
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
That'd be, that'd be amazing.

370
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
That'd be really cool.

371
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Yeah.

372
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,000
So, can not, check your, what's, what's
possible.

373
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Let's see.

374
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Then, yeah.

375
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
What's happened in the dev down, what's
happened in the Ergo development

376
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
ecosystem?

377
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
A lot of things.

378
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,000
So, there is a need to, release 6.0
finally.

379
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:55,000
So, yeah, there is a new code for 5.0.27
and so 5.1 somewhat new release also,

380
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:03,000
right?

381
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:08,000
So hopefully it can be done around
Monday, right?

382
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:15,000
So it's finalized and yeah, please help
with testing.

383
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:20,000
So yeah, I will test on 102 nodes.

384
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:27,000
And then, yeah, well, 6.0 hopefully will
be released next week, maybe closer to the

385
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:34,000
end of the week if no more issues will be
found.

386
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:46,000
So, last week Dusick found some
consensus, possibly critical vector to

387
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:57,000
split the 5.0 and 6.0 nodes, but yeah,
it's hardly exploitable probably.

388
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:04,000
You need to do proof of work on two
different blocks basically.

389
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:16,000
But yeah well anyway better to fix all
those vectors so oh yeah it's done now so

390
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:28,000
hopefully it's the last issue and yeah so
we are good to go and then yeah well

391
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,000
We need still to set activation dates.

392
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Currently I'm thinking about something
like June 25th to July 1st.

393
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:45,000
And then in July we can start to deploy
sub-blocks supporting nodes into the

394
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:52,000
public testnet as well.

395
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:59,000
So yeah, it would be good to mix nodes,
not updated like yours, maybe mining nodes

396
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:05,000
and also new nodes with sub-blocks
support.

397
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:15,000
To see how it would take place in the
mainnet as well.

398
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:21,000
All right, so yeah, well, I'm currently
doing some fixes and optimizations with

399
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:27,000
sub-blocks.

400
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:35,000
And well, hopefully in the next few days,
there will be another DevNet update.

401
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:41,000
And then, yeah, well, we can start
releasing maybe versions since the public

402
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:47,000
testnet, right?

403
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Like 6.5 maybe.

404
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Let's see.

405
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Still I'm not sure about versioning here.

406
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:03,000
And then, yeah, there will be a need to
formalize security, right?

407
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:12,000
And so we'll discuss designs with people
around.

408
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:21,000
And yeah, then let's see what could be a
mainnet activation date about.

409
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Then also published sigma chains
refactoring plan.

410
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:37,000
So it seems it's actually not so much
work to do to start at least some merge

411
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:45,000
mined sidechains, right?

412
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
The simplest option, actually.

413
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:54,000
And then, yeah, well, think about support
for dedicated sigma chains.

414
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:59,000
So, yeah, it seems there is some interest
here, right?

415
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:06,000
And then, yeah, it's also worth to think
how to scale it and how to organize

416
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:13,000
development.

417
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
So we'll publish some thoughts on that.

418
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Hopefully in coming days, but let's see.

419
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:22,000
So also thinking which videos to do for
the anniversary.

420
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:29,000
So probably there will be two videos, one
about sub-blocks and so on.

421
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:40,000
And another one is about the end game,
the end game for crypto and crypto.

422
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:48,000
And yeah, I think that the progress is
good in regards with development.

423
00:33:48,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Probably the bigger issue now is to find
something for this, right?

424
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Tech for real, like, I don't know, like
BRICK.

425
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
BRICK.

426
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Hell yeah, BRICK.

427
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
I tell you, we had to cut those kids off.

428
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:16,000
We had to stop it because kids were we
had to just freeze BRICK collection or

429
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:21,000
distribution because kids were going out
during cleanup on the on the milestone

430
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:26,000
plate behind me and just taking
everybody's scrap papers and trying to

431
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:31,000
turn them in for more BRICK even though
they weren't their plots so we had to be

432
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:36,000
like yeah it's done for the it's done for
the semester guys oh that was funny

433
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Let's see, we got, oh yeah, let me
mention too, guys.

434
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
I put it in chat.

435
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,000
15,000 ERGs have been collected so far
for the raffle for the Fiat Unwrap, the US

436
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Fiat Unwrap.

437
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,000
67.99 ERG to go.

438
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Now, I'm not calling out all you people
that keep asking when US access, when US

439
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:08,000
access, but it has to be, I'm looking at
the numbers here, there are, 1400 tickets,

440
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:15,000
94 backers in my whole lifetime here at
Ergo.

441
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
I think there are way more than 94 people
that have bitched about not having us

442
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
access.

443
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
So what are you guys doing?

444
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Put your money where your mouth is.

445
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Donate to this damn raffle and let's get
it taken care of.

446
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
All right.

447
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Get it done.

448
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:38,000
I'm sure you've heard thousands of users
bitch about us access guys, right?

449
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
You've been here longer.

450
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Yeah.

451
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
You got to use HQx's new chat.

452
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,000
That way there's a cost of whining.

453
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Yeah, that's good idea.

454
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:53,000
He should, HQx should run it through AI
before it pops up the wallet.

455
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
And if he notices it's a whining post,
then he should charge triple for the

456
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
transaction.

457
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
That'd be ideal.

458
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Marketing, but that's us.

459
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:10,000
I just talked about watchers and how they
should be promoting the chain and how they

460
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:15,000
should be engaging more.

461
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Great.

462
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,000
All right.

463
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
We got some questions, guys.

464
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
You want to see if we got some questions?

465
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Yeah, let's go through.

466
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:27,000
That's why we're here.

467
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Let's see some chats not really Paul
starts asking for time frame for Banxa,

468
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Banxa I guess on ramp integrations, I do
not know that'd be a question for Glasgow

469
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:51,000
pop it in the chat. Joe's no longer paying
attention to EOP's shenanigans yeah

470
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Ask anybody on the EF that MiGoreng or
Glasgow.

471
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
They'd be able to get back on that kind
of thing.

472
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Let's see.

473
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Mark's asking more about Doge.

474
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:13,000
He's saying, since Doge is a fork of BTC,
why was development different?

475
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Or has Doge implemented different tooling
that Rosen has to interact with that's

476
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
different from BTC?

477
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:23,000
No, it has to do with data collection,
scraping the chain.

478
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,000
So you have the blockchain, then you have
infrastructure that's wrapped around the

479
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,000
chain that's constantly calling it and
reading the chain, putting it in a better

480
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,000
format.

481
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:42,000
So a lot of that infrastructure around
Doge itself It's pretty strict, right?

482
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
They have pretty tight rate limits.

483
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:50,000
And so then it becomes hard to extract a
lot of data from Doge because the

484
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:56,000
infrastructure doesn't really support
that.

485
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:01,000
All right.

486
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Zurich says that sometimes they
hallucinate that Doge becomes an Ergo

487
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
sidechain.

488
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Let's see.

489
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,000
You got anybody else?

490
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
They're asking about Keystone
implementation.

491
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
That would be through...

492
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
I haven't heard anything.

493
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,000
You hear anything through that, Joe, for
the finals of that?

494
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
kushti, anything from the DevDAO?

495
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Yeah, let me check the chats.

496
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Some fresh messages there.

497
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
One second.

498
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Keystone.

499
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Joe Byron says you've abandoned us.

500
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
I don't think Joe's abandoned us, guys.

501
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Joe's one of those that are still in
chat, still hanging around, still

502
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
answering questions.

503
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
It's just a time thing.

504
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:57,000
He likes to sleep in past 6 a.m. Colorado
time.

505
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Yeah, when the AMAs are at 6 a.m.,
there's a certain incentive where I just

506
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:05,000
kind of don't want to look at the screen
like an idiot, you know?

507
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:10,000
I need some time to warm up.

508
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Here we go, Joe.

509
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
This is for you from Ursa Minor.

510
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Can a token like Rosen have a... Oh,
sorry.

511
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Go for it.

512
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Go for it, kushti.

513
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,000
You got it up there.

514
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:30,000
So, yeah, for Keystone, yeah, seems there
is some chats.

515
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Yeah, something about USB feature, key
stock connection entry.

516
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:45,000
So yeah, it seems, yeah, well, some parts
still under implementation.

517
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:49,000
But yeah, most of it done, I believe.

518
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Nice.

519
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
All right, let's see.

520
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Ursa Minor is saying, can a token like
Rosen have a bigger market cap than ERG?

521
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
It's a good question for both of you.

522
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
I don't know.

523
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:07,000
I think that relative to what it offers,
ERG is very mismatched based on the rest

524
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:12,000
of the crypto market.

525
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:18,000
That's my opinion, especially someone
who's dug through different stacks and

526
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:23,000
kind of working with interoperability
between chains.

527
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:29,000
I think a lot of it is more, maybe as an
open community, we're not as good at talk

528
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:35,000
and hype and marketing, but I don't know,
like off-chain, like promises and talk is

529
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:41,000
cheap and honor is priceless, right?

530
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,000
And I would say on-chain, you know,
marketing is cheap as hell, but execution

531
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
is priceless.

532
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:54,000
And I think we do a pretty damn good job
in terms of execution.

533
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Execution research implementation.

534
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
I think we punch way above our weight.

535
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:05,000
So I would say that the mismatch there is
probably Ergo itself.

536
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
And that is what it is.

537
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Maybe it's a function of awareness.

538
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,000
I think that's probably the largest.

539
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Access is definitely something as well.

540
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
That's a struggle.

541
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:24,000
But, when you have something that's some,
you know, vibe coded white paper with some

542
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:30,000
vibe coded shit, that's for a billion
dollars, that's not even real.

543
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,000
You know, the markets, you know, there,
there, there's a certain, I don't know,

544
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:39,000
belief that, you know, the market is
always, you know, right.

545
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
But then it's also always changing.

546
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,000
So I don't know.

547
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,000
To be honest, I, for most of the time so
far with Rosen, I haven't really been

548
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,000
tracking the token too much.

549
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:57,000
I've been focusing on execution, right?

550
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Just because I would rather there be like
software.

551
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,000
I don't know, when I joined the crypto
space, it was about like, okay, we're

552
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,000
going to have this distributed network and
then we're going to have distributed

553
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,000
software on top of a distributed network.

554
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:20,000
And so that's really been more my focus
than, I don't know.

555
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Number go up.

556
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Yeah, like I feel like an idiot if I talk
too much about something that doesn't

557
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,000
exist, right?

558
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Maybe that's me, but you know.

559
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:39,000
I think that the execution side is the
most important thing I can contribute.

560
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:47,000
We do have some open discussions and
proposals in the Paideia DAO, and I'm

561
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:55,000
hoping that the community is paying
attention and is going to give feedback.

562
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,000
I sometimes I drop ideas and it's like
the best thing I hope for is just

563
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,000
feedback.

564
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Like I'd love to hear like, Hey,
Armeanio, this is a very stupid idea.

565
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Oh, you know, and this is how to make it
better.

566
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
I'd love that.

567
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:17,000
So feel free to like, no, refine it.

568
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:23,000
And the first part of that question, Joe,
he was targeting essentially if Rosen gets

569
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:29,000
bigger than ERG what's that say for the
security of ERG like Ergo will that in my

570
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:35,000
personal opinion i think those things go
hand in hand i don't really see rosen

571
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:41,000
getting out of hand compared to ergo where
the where what's it called where the hash

572
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:47,000
of ergo is so far down yeah i don't i
personally think they go hand in hand

573
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,000
I don't think long term that makes too
much practical sense, but maybe in crypto

574
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,000
sense, I mean, weird shit happens every
day.

575
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:02,000
But I do think that one thing that we
haven't really discussed long term with

576
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Rosen is this potential to take a lot of
the stable coins that we've been playing

577
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:14,000
with for years on Ergo and putting them
into new environments.

578
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Right.

579
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:21,000
And I think that once you know, as we
continue to iterate, you know, perhaps

580
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Gluon scales well, perhaps Dexy scales
well, etc., that we have the ability to,

581
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:33,000
you know, offer some unique value
propositions into other ecosystems,

582
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:39,000
especially as kind of the centralized
stables become more regulated, more

583
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:45,000
monitored, more AML KYC, more, you know,
of the kind of old banking system coming

584
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:51,000
into play, which I think is probably
inevitable looking at how bills or

585
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:57,000
legislation is advancing.

586
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:04,000
So I think one unique thing about Ergo is
we are kind of gray.

587
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Nobody's heard of us, which is a certain
advantage, right?

588
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:12,000
We have a lot of things that just people
aren't tracking.

589
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:17,000
And I think that kind of gives us some
room to play around.

590
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Yeah, and that's how you can actually
play and try what can scale.

591
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Like Bitcoin was in shadows also before
the Wikileaks blockade moment, right?

592
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:45,000
So when Wikileaks got cut from Visa,
MasterCard and so on.

593
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:50,000
And then, yeah, it was the first probably
big marketing campaign for Bitcoin,

594
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:55,000
actually.

595
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:07,000
So, yeah, well, with tech stack, maybe
it's about time, right, to get also some

596
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:19,000
big marketing campaign of that kind.

597
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:23,000
All right, let's see what else we have.

598
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:27,000
CannonQ posts, for people, there's a free
play sponsored by the Sigmanauts today at

599
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:31,000
5 p.m. UTC in Cyberverse.

600
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,000
If you guys haven't played Cyberverse for
a while, hop back in.

601
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,000
I mean, they're still doing update after
update after update.

602
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Very, very cool game.

603
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Multi-Chain, Cardano, Ronin, Ergo.

604
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,000
But you don't really notice when you go
in the game.

605
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
That's the cool thing about it.

606
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,000
So hop on their free play sponsor for the
Sigmanauts.

607
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:58,000
What else?

608
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:05,000
JayL says, I hope Joe still loves us.

609
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Zo says, Joe, can you guys speak about
liquidity and a hole on Rosen Bridge?

610
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:17,000
Before you do, let me just remind people
that the idea discussions are up.

611
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
I'm going to post it in chat right now.

612
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Please, please go, please chat and look
at the discussions.

613
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Engage the people.

614
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,000
I see, oh, there's two comments on
Treasury proposal number one.

615
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
So that's good.

616
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
At least somebody's kind of chatting it.

617
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
I just put it in chat.

618
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Please go there, talk about it.

619
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
But yeah, sorry, go for it, Joe.

620
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Can you speak about liquidity and a hole
on Rosen Bridge?

621
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Sure.

622
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:49,000
You know, a large part of our focus thus
far has just been base scaling across

623
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:53,000
chains, right?

624
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:58,000
And one thing that we definitely need to
play catch up on in terms of like access,

625
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:03,000
which Rosen at the end of the day is
infrastructure, right?

626
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,000
I think it would be great to see Rosen
integrated into more wallets in different

627
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,000
ecosystems.

628
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:14,000
That way, you know, the like user barrier
to use it is lower.

629
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:21,000
I do think that continued dApp
partnerships is really important, but one

630
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:28,000
thing that I think sometimes is overlooked
is Capital flows to where it's respected.

631
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,000
I think that's a good starting point.

632
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:35,000
And let's say we have access to Bitcoin.

633
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,000
That is a great starting point.

634
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:44,000
And it's a question of saying, OK, it's
ease of access plus incentive.

635
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:50,000
And I do think that having more
incentives across applications for

636
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:56,000
liquidity is going to be quite an
important part of how Rosen scales now as

637
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:02,000
like the team. One thing that we see in a
lot of infrastructure is you know you say

638
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:08,000
okay well we built this and then we go
find you know one or two entities that

639
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:14,000
basically hold ninety five percent of the
value of the bridge. You know there's a

640
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:20,000
lot of bridges around that like like more
or less it's couple large funds I'm gonna

641
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:26,000
say kind of farming everybody right and
you know that is

642
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:31,000
I guess good for really rapid growth and
TVL and bridges, but it also is something

643
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:36,000
where it's dependent on select few.

644
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:40,000
I've always hoped that with Rosen, we
create something unique in terms of open

645
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:44,000
specs and we scale first more laterally
into different ecosystems, different

646
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:48,000
chains.

647
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:56,000
And as we do that, gains in a certain
popularity and marketing, etc., comes once

648
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:02,000
there's something to execute on.

649
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:07,000
And sometimes crypto is very backwards,
where you have massive liquidity for a

650
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:12,000
promise.

651
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
They have massive liquidity in a project
that's like, hey, we might build

652
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
something.

653
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:23,000
It's closed source and hopefully we
deliver it to main net.

654
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:28,000
And there have been times where it's like
they quote unquote run out of money or

655
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:33,000
quit and they don't even open source what
they did do.

656
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:37,000
So how do you know there's even work
there?

657
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:40,000
I don't know.

658
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Again, I've always thought that if you
want to look at organic growth, execution

659
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:49,000
has to come first for long-term
sustainability.

660
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:55,000
That's not popular in the crypto space,
but I do think that it opens us up to this

661
00:50:55,000 --> 00:51:01,000
potential where, you know, at any moment,
you know, Rosen could get marketing and

662
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:07,000
then we have like the foundation, to
actually make that scale.

663
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
And I do want to play around with things,
right?

664
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:13,000
It's like, okay, well, if we, support
Monero, I think that would be pretty cool.

665
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,000
If we, you know, back into a lot of the
exchange layer twos, it'd be a little

666
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,000
funny to relist Monero.

667
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:27,000
But from a marketing perspective, that's,
It's not my strong suit.

668
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:33,000
I think that the most important thing is
just to have solid execution and then you

669
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:39,000
have something to market.

670
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Because how many crypto narratives have
people heard where it's just like drum

671
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,000
beats, oh, this is so sexy, this is
amazing, da da da.

672
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:50,000
And then at the end of the day, the
narrative changes, right?

673
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
It's like, well, what actually got
delivered?

674
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
What can we execute here?

675
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
And I get tired of that.

676
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:00,000
I've been, I don't know, maybe I've been
in crypto too long where it's like your

677
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,000
white paper and your marketing is cheap,
execute.

678
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,000
You know, and then you have something
that, you know, if it's done well, you

679
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:10,000
know, it'll last.

680
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
And if it's open source, people can make
it better.

681
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:25,000
Yeah.

682
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
Grayman wants some clarity.

683
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Some more clarity.

684
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
He wants to hear from kushti real quick.

685
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,000
Maybe that's the last one about the
security hash.

686
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,000
If Rosen gets above Ergo, essentially
he's saying, can the market cap of all

687
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,000
tokens in Ergo exceed the market cap of
ERG?

688
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:42,000
And if so, does that compromise security?

689
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Is he answered different in proof of
stake networks?

690
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
kushti?

691
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
No.

692
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,000
But how?

693
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,000
I don't think so.

694
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:59,000
So even more in the long term, a big
market cap of tokens also does mean a big

695
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:07,000
amount of storage rent, which is
increasing security actually.

696
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:16,000
So here is dynamics may be different from
other blockchains because of storage rent.

697
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:24,000
But here, so well, tokens do contribute
in the long term.

698
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:33,000
Well, actually already contributing to
the security budget, right, of mining.

699
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:40,000
So just in recent weeks, so there were
like meets of SigmaUSD and meets of

700
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:47,000
SigmaRSV collected and so on, like all the
NFTs, right, which can be sold on auctions

701
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:54,000
and so on.

702
00:53:54,000 --> 00:54:02,000
So, yeah, well, with time, well, a big
total market cap of tokens is actually

703
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:10,000
good and adding to the security, I think.

704
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:15,000
So yeah, well, here Ergo is quite unique,
right?

705
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:22,000
So it's, it's different from, I don't
know, from like every other blockchain,

706
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:29,000
because of demurrage components, which is
adding a new variable in the mining

707
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:36,000
security budget equation.

708
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
And I, you know, it's weird.

709
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:44,000
I was reading through the, I think they
call it the clarity bill, which is some

710
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:48,000
legislative bullshit in the United States
that they're talking about.

711
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:54,000
But it seemed as though it shifted the
incentives, you know, It's basically how

712
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:59,000
are we going to distribute regulatory
oversight of these new digital assets.

713
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:06,000
And it did seem to create an incentive
for app chains, which maybe people are

714
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:12,000
around in 2017 when there was Like, I
don't know, let's just say a lot of great

715
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:18,000
looking white papers and a lot of promises
sold and then shit execution.

716
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,000
And then it kind of created this fear of
like, oh, well, you know, maybe everything

717
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,000
needs to be in L1.

718
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:28,000
And so, you know, You know, this idea of
like application specific chains kind of

719
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,000
popped up.

720
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:37,000
And I do think that, you know, having
proof of work is like a base is a great

721
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:42,000
thing to point to in terms of like, you
know, it's an actual like fair launch

722
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:47,000
commodity versus, you know, in the crypto
space.

723
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:51,000
I don't really know how you spend the
narrative that it's like, oh yeah, we see

724
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:55,000
around 80% of supply, but it's a
commodity, right?

725
00:55:55,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Some mental gymnastics, but it is what it
is.

726
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:05,000
I do think that there's probably going to
be a growing use case for

727
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:10,000
application-specific merge mined chains,
and if we can create a package to where

728
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:15,000
that's easily deployable, we just add to
the security budget of Ergo and we create

729
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:20,000
some cover for people in certain
jurisdictions that want to play around

730
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:25,000
with Ergo itself.

731
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:34,000
Yeah, not that hard to do that even.

732
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:40,000
I mean, from what we do have at the
moment, it's not a long path even.

733
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:52,000
So, well, it's possible to run some merge
mined sidechains somewhat like weeks.

734
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Yeah, I would say, you know, as the mice,
we need to be aware of the cat, have new

735
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:00,000
tactics to deploy, right?

736
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:04,000
And I think that increasingly that'll be
a powerful tactic.

737
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,000
If there are a couple of developers and
so on.

738
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:13,000
So, yeah, well, even one maybe in a few
weeks.

739
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Yeah, but well, with knowledge, right, of
Sigma Rust and so on.

740
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Sigma and then yeah Sigma Rust baby. So
yeah yeah quite quite doable i think and

741
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:36,000
yeah it's it's like a good direction right
to to explore well guys it's 10 o'clock my

742
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:44,000
time

743
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Two o'clock UTC.

744
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,000
It's quitting time.

745
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:53,000
Do you need to go to some meeting?

746
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
Every time, kushti.

747
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,000
I don't know how it works out.

748
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,000
Every freaking time.

749
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
All right.

750
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Okay.

751
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:07,000
We'll have more reports next week on a
finalized schedule for the event meetup.

752
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:11,000
And guys, again, fill these in the damn
raffle.

753
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Yeah, and also we will have our
anniversary on July 1st, it seems, so

754
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
yeah.

755
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Yes, yes.

756
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
We got that coming up.

757
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:22,000
Andy just shared a big list of videos
that we went through to try to figure out

758
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,000
what videos can be put out there.

759
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
So that's going to be exciting.

760
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:33,000
I'm going to meet up with Dan and try to
meet up with Allison as well and get some

761
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:38,000
Machina Finance and as well as some Winter
Protocol and why Ergo was amazing and make

762
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:43,000
something like Palmer possible.

763
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
So those are just two of the many videos
that we'll see on Ergoversary that are

764
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
new.

765
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,000
Awesome.

766
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
Including yours, kushti.

767
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,000
All right.

768
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:55,000
All right.

769
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Nice.

770
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Yeah.

771
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Okay.

772
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:00,000
So, yeah, stay tuned.

773
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Have a good one.

774
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:05,000
Ciao.
