1
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Hello and welcome to the Ergo Developer
Update.

2
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
A lot of things happening out there this
week.

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I know we're a little late today by one
day, but the impact should be just as

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
much.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'm not going to go into those current
events about the $1.4 billion hack.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
We covered some of that in the spaces
that we did with the Rosen Bridge team,

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Joe and one of his developers that joined.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So if you want to hear about that kind of
stuff, then tune into that.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
It's still on our Twitter main Twitter
account.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It's about an hour listen, but always
good talks when you're talking to Joe.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Oh, it's good stuff to talk about.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
So quickly, not a big dev update today.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
But one thing I want to stress very hard
to you is that these events that happen,

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
these hacks, these things that could be
prevented, right? If there was due

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
diligence, if there was forethought and
actual research done before implementing

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
these fast and loose things or these fast
and loose protocols that, you know, you

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
surprise Pikachu look when something gets
hacked, right?

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I think this is a good case to add some,
not hope, but add some justification to

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
why you're in Ergo, why you're actually
sticking around with Ergo, and why

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
something that's built for resilience,
it's built for mindfulness, it's built

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
from the beginning with things like
storage rent, demurrage, and other things

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
are, you know, these things are resilient.

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
These things are going to last through
these crazy hacks where a smart contract

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
can be changed, you know, just by the
multi-sig signatures.

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It's like kind of stuff that you hear
outside of the ecosystem and you're like,

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
wow, you know, how was it this many funds
put into something like that when

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
something like that could have happened?

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
So moments like that make me very happy
that we're in Ergo and we're in it for the

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
long haul, you know, especially through
these turbulent times of, you know, VC

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
value extraction and all that, we can sit
back and think, you know, we're building

31
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
something that's resilient, we're building
P2P finance for essentially anyone.

32
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
So moments like that is, while they're
awful and you feel terrible for the people

33
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
that suffer those losses, it does
hopefully make you recognize why we're in

34
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
this space and why we're doing what we're
doing and why we're not catering to this

35
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
kind of pump and dump kind of stuff.

36
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
All right, that being said, let's switch
over to a quick little topic I want to

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
cover before we dive into the dev update.

38
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
OK, if you don't notice, I have Telegram
up to my, there we go, right there to my

39
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
right.

40
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It looks like on the screen.

41
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
The Telegram channel I have open is
something very unique that I don't think

42
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
you find anywhere else in any mining
community out there, right?

43
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
In any major mining community.

44
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Miners are unique, right?

45
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Miners will point their rigs to something
and, you know, it's a business.

46
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
They'll point their rigs.

47
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
They'll cash out their token or they'll
speculate and hold that token and cash it

48
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
out another time.

49
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
That's a business.

50
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
That's great.

51
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Nothing wrong with that.

52
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
But there's more that can be done with
this, right?

53
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
There's more involvement.

54
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
There's more control that these miners
have over especially our ecosystem.

55
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
You know, they're maybe used to pointing
towards a chain to mine where they have no

56
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
control, right?

57
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
We saw in the news the other day that a
chain was threatening Herominers, right?

58
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Saying that you have too much of the hash.

59
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
If you don't back down or warn your users
or put a limit on there, we're going to

60
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
stop you from mining it.

61
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Now, that should come in your mind as
like absolutely bonkers, right?

62
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
So props to Herominers for being like,
you know, screw you, you know, this is

63
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
permissionless.

64
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
This is supposed to be permissionless.

65
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
You know, we the miners should self
regulate here.

66
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Right.

67
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
And that's our thought on that.

68
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Miners should in their best interest be
self regulating.

69
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Right.

70
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It is not in their interest to get to a
point where the chain could be attacked

71
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
and the value that they've accumulated is
completely toast, right?

72
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
So in theory, miners should be able to
self-regulate.

73
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
And this is exactly what Sigmanauts'
mining DAO does.

74
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Now, if you haven't heard about
Sigmanauts' mining DAO, or maybe you have,

75
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
so far that we know is the only pool
essentially that is collecting storage

76
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
rent, right?

77
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
It's a DAO-based mining pool.

78
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
That means once you come in, you get a
token that lets you use Paideia and create

79
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
votes that maybe change miner payout
methods for bonus tokens.

80
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
They have a ton of bonus tokens that
projects have donated to them.

81
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
So those go out every so often.

82
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
They have an amazing telegram here with
tons of chats, a general chat, a hash bot

83
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
that tells you the connected miners and
the current hash of the pool, block

84
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
notification bots.

85
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Oh, you see how I haven't kept up with
that.

86
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
A storage rent monitor, it shows you how
much storage rent we're actually

87
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
collecting.

88
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Announcements, payments blocks, the PHP
meme token that was started from one of

89
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
the first full package meme tokens that we
pulled from the chain with storage rent.

90
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I think the entire circulation was
pulled, it was all in one box with not

91
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
enough ERGs, so really got lucky there.

92
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
And then they turned it around and added
quite a bit of liquidity to the PHP pool.

93
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
a fun show off your rigs pool
overclocking help bonus token distribution

94
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
so it shows every time that bonus tokens
go out and it looks like let's see 17th

95
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
and then before that was the 10th so it
looks like every week all these bonus

96
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
tokens are dropped to these wallets the
PHP, RSV, Dis, Ergonaut, little Puppy

97
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
token, GIF Fox, Ergo One, Wooden Nickels,
Clown, Sigma that's mining pool token,

98
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Dark Erdoge

99
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Terahertz, EGO, Bunz, CRPX, Troll, RSV
Hoskey, is that a Melty Smiley? I can't

100
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
see.

101
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Comet, MiGoreng, Alien Rocket, Bulls,
Alien, Love, and GreasyCex.

102
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
So tons of bonus tokens that are there
for fun and also for speculation and for

103
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
cashing out.

104
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
A lot of these tokens have liquidity
pools.

105
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Mining with the Sigmanauts gets you
several things.

106
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:25,000
One, it gets you voting power on how to
run the mining pool, right?

107
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Because on Ergo, people seem to forget
that miners have control to change some

108
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
parameters in the entire chain, right?

109
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
That's often forgotten.

110
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
So Sigmanauts mining now takes that to
heart and says if you can change the

111
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
chain, miners should be able to manage
their DAO themselves.

112
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
All that kind of stuff is votable.

113
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
People put up proposals on Paideia, vote
on them.

114
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I think the latest one was probably with
a PHP token distribution, or Mark actually

115
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
may have put one up today, I can't
remember.

116
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
But fantastic place to be, fantastic
place to take ownership and take control

117
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
of the ecosystem as kushti says.

118
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I cannot, until hash gets too high on
this pool, I cannot stress to use this

119
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
pool.

120
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
They're the only ones doing that stuff
that I know of.

121
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
And, you know, why not get a little extra
bang for your buck when you mine into it?

122
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
All right?

123
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Fantastic.

124
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Let's jump into, oh, and you can get
there from sigmanauts.com slash mining.

125
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:29,000
You can see how to join the pool, how to
join the telegram and get started there.

126
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Great, let's dive right into the
developer update.

127
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
All right, we have AnonBR with Nautilus.

128
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
The entire main interface is ported to
the new design system.

129
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Now there are only four medium complexity
components on the dApp connector left to

130
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
be ported.

131
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
If all goes well, we can have a beta
release next week.

132
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Refracted and merge add read-only
WalletView and restore WalletView and to

133
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
import WalletView.

134
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Added recovery phrase backup verification
flow and create wallet view.

135
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Added support for view storing wallets
from 10, 15, 18, 21, and 24 word recovery

136
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
phrase.

137
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
That's great.

138
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
That's great.

139
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Added several minor UI fixes and code
quality improvements.

140
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
All right, kushti with Ergo Protocol and
Reference Client R&D doing final audit and

141
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
code cleaning for 6.0 codebase for input
blocks working on input blocks coming out

142
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
to border and forks resolution.

143
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Somebody put fast, very clever there.

144
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
SigmaUSD Oracle pool has been updated,
FII now update script is allowing to

145
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
update the pool to version 2.

146
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
And I think I said last week that won't
be GORT as in Gold Oracle Reward Tokens,

147
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,000
it's going to be Dollar Oracle Reward
Tokens, which is DORT.

148
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
So if you're privileged enough to run the
Oracle version 2 of SigmaUSD, it will be

149
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
DORT tokens as a reward.

150
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
OK, Celaut project, implementing simple
services to try to have some examples of

151
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
potentially interesting architectures.

152
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
At the same time, I'm fixing bugs I find
in the node and improving the usability of

153
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
the terminal.

154
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Awesome.

155
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
C8 was talking about ZeroConf.

156
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Let's see.

157
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
We have C8 here with Ergify.

158
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
ETA Dexy Gold alpha UI end of next week.

159
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
That's awesome.

160
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Swap UI done.

161
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
History work in progress.

162
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Mempool server integration work in
progress.

163
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Design work in progress.

164
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
ErgoPay work in progress.

165
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
And you can see his work right there.

166
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Did I forget the thumbs up now?

167
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Good.

168
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
All right, we have Anand Bihar here
again.

169
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I think he's just answering somebody.

170
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Yeah, he's answering C8.

171
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Is that it?

172
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:47,000
That may be a short one.

173
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
We have NoRoYogi.

174
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
This is Mark the Shark, the leader of the
Sigmanauts mining DAO, who we were just

175
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
speaking about.

176
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Sigmanauts mining pool, ergo-miners.com
is back online.

177
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Reviving miner, do you work specifically
for miners, changing payout for miner?

178
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Reworked UI and embedded into dash, just
need to glance over database code for this

179
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
and should be there soon.

180
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
qx() deleted some massive files on the
server, and we added another volume to our

181
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
server, 100 gigabytes.

182
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Yeah, we've had a few, in the beginning,
we had a few hangups of the logs just

183
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
going crazy and bringing the server down
for a few minutes.

184
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
So we turned off logging on one of the
apps, which made a big difference, deleted

185
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
some weird caching that was happening in
Docker for the database, and it freed up

186
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
like 20, 30 gigs.

187
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
So we don't even need to migrate to the
new drive yet, but super cool.

188
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Pool hash at 103.

189
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I think we saw it was 105 in the thing I
just had up at the time.

190
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Distributed largest weekly collection of
ERG from Demurrage Storage Rent.

191
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
29.7 ERG.

192
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
So this is like, come on guys, like, look
at these other pools.

193
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I get it.

194
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
You know, a lot of other major pools,
they're running ERG, they're running tons

195
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
of other chains, right?

196
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
So it's not on their main list to
implement Storage Rent.

197
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
It's going to be soon though, I guarantee
it.

198
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
But for now, Sigmanauts, hit it up guys.

199
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Sharknet, funded 190 ERGs from community
and refinance for paying auditors for the

200
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
LLM generated smart contracts,
successfully built and trained LLM using

201
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
DR Pro on a small set of data provided by
Lotto, created simple UI for users to load

202
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
model to run locally.

203
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
So guys, this is very cool.

204
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Let me explain where this is going,
right?

205
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
So imagine either going to a site, paying
a few tokens, or else, of course, the

206
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
ability to pull it down from GitHub
yourself if you have that ability.

207
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Those options can always be available and
are encouraged in Ergo, right?

208
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:48,000
But let's say Sigmanauts are hosting an
LLM for a smart contract building.

209
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Go there, put in a few tokens worth of
whatever your prompt is.

210
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
You're looking for a simple locking smart
contract.

211
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
You're looking for, I don't know, some
sort of time release or some other thing,

212
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
even more complex things.

213
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
That's the goal is you type in your
prompt, tell it what you want, and boom,

214
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
it outputs a smart contract that has gone
through numerous amounts of training

215
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
times.

216
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
to give you a smart contract that's
pretty good.

217
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
And then, of course, perhaps another very
specifically fine-tuned LLM to

218
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
double-check that smart contract for you.

219
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Maybe they're built together, maybe
they're not.

220
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Who knows?

221
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
We're not at quite at that stage yet, but
that's what this, that's what NoRoYogi is

222
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
working towards.

223
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,000
So super, super cool sharknet.

224
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Okay, what else do we have node view x,
y, z, added pop-ups for Spectrum DEX

225
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
swaps, SigmaUSD swaps, bitcoin, Rosen
Bridge, sorry, SigmaUSD swaps and Rosen

226
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Bridge events, decreased number of
requested boxes for index page price

227
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
chart, added timeout for node change
dialogue when loading node connections.

228
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
That's super neat.

229
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Can we see it here?

230
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Nice.

231
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
All right, we've got Rosen Bridge.

232
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
We are in step-by-step testing of Wallace
before opening the website.

233
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Reform manual transaction, create four to
five test events between Binance and other

234
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
networks.

235
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Once everything is verified, open the
website publicly.

236
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
They did.

237
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
It's open as of maybe last night or this
morning, or maybe it was yesterday.

238
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Time kind of blends together, right?

239
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Rosen Bridge Watcher version 2 completed
the observation status service to update

240
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
and change the status of operations.

241
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Added the permit check service, which
registers as a permit check into the

242
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
health check service.

243
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
The Rosen Bridge app.

244
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
They've implemented a disconnect feature
to properly disconnect wallets.

245
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Oh, good.

246
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Ensure responsive design for tablet-sized
screens.

247
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Apply the new design for monetary values.

248
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
The Watcher app.

249
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Apply the new design for monetary values.

250
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Guard app.

251
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Apply the same thing.

252
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Add a TX status to public event status.

253
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
So Rosen Bridge is alive, guys, if you're
running a watcher, please let me take a

254
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
minute to tell you, please do this update.

255
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Right.

256
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
That's very important.

257
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I know some of you may be a little
nervous about the update from two or three

258
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
weeks ago where there's a database
migration.

259
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Right.

260
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Docker had pulled a version of the
Postgres database that was being used as

261
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
the in the pull commands to populate that.

262
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
So it had to be changed.

263
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
You were probably getting a permission
denied error when you tried to run it for

264
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
an update if you didn't follow the
instructions.

265
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
So please follow that.

266
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
It's 10 minutes max.

267
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,000
It does not take long to copy the
database, back it up, make your little

268
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,000
switches, and then push the old database
to restore to the new database container.

269
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I did it on my watchers, didn't take too
much time at all, and I spun back up.

270
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
So if you're worried about that, give
that a try.

271
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Feel free to reach out in a DM if you
like if you're running into trouble.

272
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
We can certainly help you and walk you
through that because it's very important

273
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
to have all those watchers up and updated.

274
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Otherwise, you're just burning
electricity and it's not going to watch

275
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
any events, right?

276
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Okay, what else do we have here?

277
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Okay.

278
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
That is it, folks.

279
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
All right.

280
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Thanks for joining us.

281
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Make sure, again, watchers, update your
watchers.

282
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Guards are all updated.

283
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
See if you can provide some liquidity.

284
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I know MewFinance just created a fund to
provide some liquidity for Rosen BNB and

285
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
ERG on this side.

286
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I think it's only 500 or so ERGs.

287
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
in total maybe a thousand so we can
capture the BNB.

288
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I need to look at that but check out
MewFinance, check out that page where you

289
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
can contribute to that kind of stuff and
you'll automatically get those liquidity

290
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
tokens having a share in the liquidity of
that.

291
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
And don't forget to check out Sigmanauts'
mining pool.

292
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Again, only pool that I know of that's
collecting storage rent for the time

293
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
being.

294
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
And you get all those bonus tokens and a
very cool, very unique community that's

295
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
always open to helping.

296
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,000
And you get to essentially run it as well
as part of the DAO.

297
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
All right.

298
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Thanks, everybody.

299
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Enjoy your week, I guess.

300
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
It's early.

301
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Ciao.
