1
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Let's see.

2
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I've got you hear us, Andy?

3
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
QX, what did you do?

4
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I didn't do anything. I don't have
control of this.

5
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You're exactly, you're out of control,
man.

6
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You're in. Andy, Andy, I've got YouTube
on, so I'm listening for free. Come back.

7
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,000
But Andy, you there?

8
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
There we go.

9
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
All right, you're good kushti we've got
volume now. All right. All right, so let's

10
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
repeat the introduction part otherwise say
it would be disconnected my part from

11
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
others.

12
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I mean, let's try again. Let's try again.
Hello everybody. Good morning You can skip

13
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
you can skip that day and it was like a
five out of ten

14
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

no, no, no, no, no, no,

20
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Yeah, all right. Well, the sound is here
right now and... Hey, everybody! Welcome

21
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
once again to the AMA.

22
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:58,000
And so, yeah, I have... Well, you know,
now that we don't have contacts, I have to

23
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:06,000
my stage right, I have none other than
kushti. Say hi to everybody again, Alex.

24
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Hi, everyone. It's my pleasure to be here
again.

25
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Again for the second time today and to my
stage left I have a certain yahoo named

26
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:24,000
qx. Huge yahoo. Good morning everybody.

27
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Yahoo, that's sometimes serious. So we'll
call them yahoo serious. Perfect.

28
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Yeah, exactly. Anyway, all right. Well,
let's get started with the AMA. So as I

29
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
was saying before when nobody could hear
me except for Alex and our favorite Yahoo

30
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
QX.

31
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Yeah, Alex, why don't you give the people
a little bit of a breakdown, a rundown of

32
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
what's been happening?

33
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Yeah so a lot of things going on at the
same time on different levels. Well in the

34
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
first place there are a lot of talks in
the community now about positioning, you

35
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
know, the Ergo movement. So it's kind of
free movement so everyone is free to

36
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
position himself and his own group in any
way, but yeah well there is also need for

37
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
coordination.

38
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Well, there are certain requests about
that, certain demand, especially these

39
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:38,000
days, you know, when, yeah, well, many
people have feeling that, well, it's

40
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:46,000
another pivot point for cryptocurrencies,
right, cryptocurrency movements because of

41
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:54,000
many events going on at the same time.

42
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,000
So yeah, please join discussions and I
believe we need to organize some more

43
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,000
calls like town halls as soon as possible.

44
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:16,000
So then, yeah, in regards to the
development, there is good progress with

45
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:24,000
sub-blocks. So I've got my own local
miner-based DevNet just today, well,

46
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:32,000
correctly generating input blocks,
sub-blocks with transactions and creating

47
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:40,000
proper commitments.

48
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:47,000
And then as a next step I'm thinking
about adding APIs for applications

49
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:53,000
immediately, so some early version may be
available in just a few days. And only

50
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:59,000
after that I will jump on actually hardest
and very time-consuming parts, but also

51
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:05,000
invisible to application developers such
as peer-to-peer network optimizations and

52
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:11,000
so on.

53
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:19,000
But, yeah, well, application developers
at least will have a possibility starting

54
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:26,000
from, yeah, very soon, TM, to play with
single nodes, local miner-based testing

55
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:33,000
environments, at least, to check how to
speed applications up with input blocks,

56
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:40,000
sub-blocks.

57
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Then for 6.0 audit is going on. I think
there is one small issue left now. We are

58
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:05,000
discussing different issues and aspects of
design but currently there is one small

59
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:16,000
issue left unfixed and then we are good
with doing public testnet deployment and

60
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:27,000
also then it's a good time to reach mining
pools in regards with all possible

61
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:38,000
activation dates.

62
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:48,000
So yeah, a lot of things going on. Then
some talks going on. I'm actually pushing

63
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:56,000
for some talks and some decisions in
Ergodev's DAO.

64
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:05,000
So, well, the point is, I'm actually
thinking to rework the DAO and make PID

65
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:13,000
based DAO. Well, I tried yesterday,
actually, but then I got into tokenomics

66
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:21,000
questions, so we are discussing it right
now.

67
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:32,000
What I'm proposing is to have just
temporary DAOs or Ergodevs 2025, to have

68
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:41,000
very concrete specific goals for 2025 and
then also pretty specific funding goals to

69
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:50,000
be met to reach the goals and then yeah
also to help very specific concrete

70
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:59,000
initiatives, education initiatives and so
on and also help the ecosystem with

71
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:08,000
touring, education, getting new
developers.

72
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:17,000
There are some proposals about having
something like Google Summer of Codes,

73
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:23,000
right? But yeah, it's winter in the
Northern Hemisphere now, so maybe it would

74
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:29,000
be Ergo Winter of Codes. I don't know.
Let's see, maybe Spring. Then, what?

75
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Spring of Codes actually sounds good.

76
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
The Ergo Winter over discontent.

77
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:49,000
The idea is to have just a temporary
organization and then fire it up totally

78
00:10:49,000 --> 00:11:00,000
at the end of 2025 and start from scratch
next year. What's needed, I guess, is also

79
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:11,000
to help developers with different means to
find ways to fund applications internally

80
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:22,000
and externally.

81
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:33,000
So I think this is probably the most
important matter right now. So there are

82
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:41,000
different talks. It's hard to coordinate
and organize this stuff in a totally

83
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:49,000
uncontrollable environment. So, let's see.

84
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
kushti, how do you manage the treasury
with a temporary DAO? Where do you put the

85
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
treasury? Do you just make sure you
transfer it to the new DAO as it hops

86
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
over?

87
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Yeah, so the idea, you know, is to send
remaining treasury if there will be

88
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:13,000
remaining ERG at the end of 2025 to the
new DAO, right? But, yeah, having totally

89
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:20,000
new members, maybe, even. Right, so the
idea is that, you know, every organization

90
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:27,000
should have some limited time frame, I
believe.

91
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:36,000
And, yeah, so if there is something
persistent, such as treasury, yeah, maybe

92
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:42,000
it's better just to pass to the new
organization, right? Yeah, then, well, it

93
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:48,000
should work, right? If there are not many
DAO members profiting from treasury, at

94
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:54,000
least, right?

95
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,000
We managed to pull it off of the
Sigmanauts DAO when we went from beta to

96
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,000
production. But it was tricky because we
used the same token. So people would

97
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,000
unstake from the beta DAO before we fully
had everything transferred over. And we

98
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,000
had to rely on the last few people that
were still on the beta DAO to finish up

99
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,000
the token send on the DAO. So that was a
fun little test of that kind of theory.

100
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:30,000
All right. And then, yeah, so I think
also for, and here's where Ergodevs can

101
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:36,000
synchronize with Sigmanauts. So there is
need to have some vision, right, like

102
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:42,000
common vision. Well, what do we imagine
when we are talking about future of the

103
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:48,000
ecosystem, right?

104
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Because the protocol, well, it's more or
less done, right? So, well, if one is

105
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:07,000
taking a look into EAPs, right, then,
yeah, it's easy to realize that, yeah,

106
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:15,000
well, all the modifications come so that
they are soft-forkish right so well 6.0 is

107
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:23,000
just basically adding new functionality
and tweaking existing one just a little

108
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:31,000
bit by fixing just very few things.

109
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:40,000
And then input blocks are backwards
compatible, so all clients will just

110
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:47,000
receive full blocks like they are doing
now. It's basically the same protocol,

111
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:54,000
just augmented with some peer-to-peer
machinery and, yeah, well, enforced in a

112
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:01,000
soft-forkish way, so only miners would
recognize the difference, right, because,

113
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:08,000
well, miners do need to generate some new
fields, right, but, yeah, all clients can

114
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:15,000
just skip them and that's it.

115
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:26,000
And the idea, you know, is to avoid
modifying the protocol so basically at

116
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:36,000
this point Ergo is already like Bitcoin
back in 2012-14 right so quite established

117
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:46,000
protocol right maybe still experiencing
some developments like what happened with

118
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Bitcoin SegWit Taproot right so SegWit
soft fork was actually quite hard soft

119
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:06,000
fork yeah well maybe we had even harder
with 5.0 where all the clients actually

120
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:16,000
were downloaded to SPV security for all
the transactions.

121
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:24,000
6.0 would be like SegWit in regards to
the activation exactly. Yeah, well, only

122
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:31,000
for new kinds of transactions while using
new opcodes while existing clients will be

123
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:38,000
downloaded to SPV security, right? Just
blindly trusting the new nodes for

124
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:45,000
validation, right? But yeah, only for new
kinds of transactions. So I like helping

125
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:52,000
it with SegWit, actually.

126
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:01,000
And they are probably Taproot also, but I
am not quite familiar with Taproot

127
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:09,000
activation details, to be honest. And then
input blocks are just about modifying

128
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:17,000
peer-to-peer level, adding some new
structures to block extension, a section

129
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:25,000
of a block right and so it would be even
more soft right and then yeah so the idea

130
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:33,000
basically is to have a protocol which is
not touched a lot right and then which can

131
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:41,000
be evolved by building on top of it right
so without application developers having

132
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:49,000
fear that's you know the core protocol
would break everything like many

133
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:57,000
blockchains around actually can change
block time even where you know well it's

134
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:05,000
possible to do contracts based on block
height which is quite insane because

135
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:13,000
basically that means that during such
changes all the applications relying on

136
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:21,000
block heights have been broken and so on
but yeah that's what's going on but I

137
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:29,000
think the proper way is to follow the
Bitcoin way in regards to updating the

138
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:37,000
protocol in order to have global neutral
money.

139
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:52,000
All the Bitcoin issues basically like
scalability, bad support for certain

140
00:18:52,000 --> 00:19:00,000
constructions such as sidechains and
security budget issues, absence of tail

141
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:08,000
emission or demurrage. All those issues
are fixed here, right? Yeah, well, in the

142
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:16,000
long term, well, this protocol, the Ergo
protocol doesn't have issues, right, but

143
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:24,000
yeah, it's still global neutral kind of
money, ultra-fixed money, as our demurrage

144
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:32,000
wizard Luis is saying.

145
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:42,000
And then, yeah, well, also on top of this
global ultra-fixed money protocol, you can

146
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:51,000
build other sorts of money, right, like
having good money for everyone, so you're

147
00:19:51,000 --> 00:20:00,000
going to have stable coins right then
tokenized real world assets well with

148
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:09,000
insurance in form of algorithmic assets
right so you can have tokenized physical

149
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:18,000
gold secured with algorithmic gold stable
coin based insurance then.

150
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Then, yeah, well, there are tools to get
more assets from outside, from the real

151
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:30,000
world, right, in the first place, but then
also from other chains via different

152
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:36,000
cross-chaining applications, such as
Rosen, right? And then, yeah, well, with

153
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:42,000
that, there are also tools, there will be
tools to do monetary expansions, such as

154
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:48,000
ChainCash. And I believe there is need
maybe for other systems.

155
00:20:52,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Well, for example, to have off-chain
peer-to-peer cash based on on-chain

156
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:08,000
reserves, right? Or maybe even on-chain
manifestation of trust, right? So we can

157
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:16,000
imagine maybe in future even trusted
issuers like Tether, right? Well, issuing

158
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:24,000
notes in ChainCash on top of Ergo along
with other entities which may have

159
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:32,000
reserves right so on-chain reserves not
trust blind trust that we basically have

160
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:40,000
in case of Tether and so on right so well
this is kind of global ultra fixed neutral

161
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:48,000
money but also platform for producing more
money via different forms of monetary

162
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:56,000
expansion, right? That's some thoughts
which I would like to share.

163
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I still can't wrap my head around
off-chain exchange of these notes. How do

164
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,000
you imagine that happening?

165
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Actually, I tried, well, I spent a few
weeks, basically, I lost a few weeks back

166
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:27,000
in 2023 trying to get one form of exchange
of ChainCash notes. But the protocol got

167
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:35,000
overly complicated, so at some point I
just gave up because there were a lot of

168
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:43,000
security issues on the way, and by
resolving them I've got even more complex

169
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:51,000
protocol with even more possible security
issues, maybe.

170
00:22:51,000 --> 00:23:00,000
But recently what I realized by observing
some other attempts like ARK on Bitcoin so

171
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:09,000
you can have completely simplified
protocol if exchange of considering

172
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:18,000
totally trustless off-chain protocol you
may assume payment servers in case of ARK

173
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:27,000
off-chain payment solution for Bitcoin.

174
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:38,000
It's called ARK payment server. You may
have a federation instead, like maybe

175
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Rosen watchers even, to track the state of
off-chain. You may use those guardians of

176
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:58,000
off-chain states in on-chain protocols and
then yeah then it should be hard so I

177
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:08,000
don't have concrete contracts yet because
I'm currently fixing some other issues in

178
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:18,000
ChainCash contracts when I have spare time
and I don't have it basically but yeah

179
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:28,000
after fixing those issues I think to do
another attempt and yeah it seems doable.

180
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:38,000
As well it seems doable to do kind of ARK
on top of Ergo and it would be simplified

181
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:46,000
in opposite to the Bitcoin version and
also in regards with Ergo so what I'm

182
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:54,000
looking at is that you know you may have
not just simple off-chain payments right

183
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:02,000
like I'm just sending a payment to you
just like some value rights, like 5 ERG

184
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:10,000
rights off-chain.

185
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:18,000
But there could be actually some
off-chain contracts also with this. Well,

186
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:25,000
some on-chain guarantees. Well, I believe
I made one tweet on that. Yeah, one tweet

187
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:32,000
probably or something like that. But yeah,
at some point I will consider that

188
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:39,000
carefully and write down details how could
that be possible. And then you may have

189
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:46,000
programmable off-chain cash backed by
on-chain reserve. So basically, realizing

190
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:53,000
the initial dream of Hal Finney, right?

191
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Not Satoshi maybe, but maybe Satoshi, if
Hal Finney is a part of Satoshi's

192
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:13,000
identity. So yeah, the idea was that, you
know, if one ledger is not enough, maybe

193
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:22,000
it would be just settlement layer rights
for basically banks. And then those banks

194
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:31,000
may have some protocols on top of that.
And that was understood by many.

195
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Yeah, you know, blockchain is Bitcoin, at
least, you know, would be just, you know,

196
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:43,000
a network between traditional financial
institutions, right? And then they will

197
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:49,000
run Lightning Network channels with their
respective clients, right, and so on. But

198
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:55,000
I think it should be done differently,
right? So we need to have kind of free

199
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:01,000
banking network here. So peer-to-peer
banking network where everyone may become

200
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:07,000
a bank.

201
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:19,000
And then, yeah, it should be covered by
collateral rights or trust. So it's what

202
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:27,000
we have to some degree, but yeah, it's now
totally not formalized, right? And done it

203
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:35,000
quite broken way. Like, most of the crypto
industry is just blindly trusting Tether,

204
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:43,000
right? While, you know, blaming it. So,
it's kind of, I don't know, bipolar state

205
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:51,000
of crypto when everyone is hating Tether
and using USDT at the same time.

206
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:01,000
I hate you, but I can't quit you.

207
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:07,000
That sounds like a love story. You're so
bad for me, but I can't quit you. I wish I

208
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:13,000
could quit you. What was that line from
that one movie that the QX told me to

209
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:19,000
watch? Yeah, I wish I knew how to quit
you. What is it?

210
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
What is that from? I don't know.

211
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
That's from Brokeback Mountain. It's a
meme.

212
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Oh, it is. I wish I knew how to quit you.
Yep. Yep. Yep. Great movie, Dan.

213
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,000
kushti, speaking of P2P stuff, I saw some
really cool, I think it was Reddit

214
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,000
yesterday or the day before. Somebody was
asking people to check out their app that

215
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,000
they're developing, and they developed a
reputation-based peer-to-peer on-ramp. So

216
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
what it does is it connects people, it's
just an app that connects people that want

217
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,000
to buy Bitcoin in cash, it was for
Bitcoin, to buy Bitcoin in cash and a

218
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,000
meetup space as well as reputation. So I
can understand that it's not a good idea

219
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,000
probably to meet somebody with a wad full
of cash to buy Bitcoin in a dark place,

220
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,000
but I guess that's where he's trying to
be.

221
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Isn't that the same with local Bitcoins
though? Is that what it is there is

222
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,000
something already like that bitcoins I
don't know I mean it's probably still

223
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
around but I remember back in what like
2016 or something like that oh I remember

224
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,000
local Bitcoin back in 2012 yeah so it was
I mean they were they were already around

225
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
but for a while by then but I remember
like 2015 2016 I used to use local

226
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,000
bitcoins.

227
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Yeah, yeah. Was it reputation based?

228
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Yeah, yeah. So it had a rating and yeah,
it was since, I don't know, 2011, 12. And

229
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:50,000
yeah, but basically it got shut down.
It's, I don't know, like by the government

230
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:59,000
around late 2010s. Well, I don't know. It
was a soft kind of shutdown. So, I had

231
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:08,000
talks with the CTO basically back in 2015.
And so back in 2015, so the hosting

232
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:17,000
provider, Hetzner, got phone calls from
banks informing that whether you are

233
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:26,000
switching local bitcoins off or we are
switching you from credit card processing.

234
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Yikes. But finally, they shut down
themselves after some European regulation

235
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:38,000
came into power, I believe. But yeah, they
had few steps, I mean, becoming more and

236
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:43,000
more shitty on the way, trying to be
compliant, more and more compliant. And

237
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:48,000
then, yeah, so they had some follow-ups
such as Hoddle Hoddle which is also quite

238
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:53,000
interesting because you're also using some
escrow contracts like multi-signature

239
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:58,000
based escrows and so on.

240
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:10,000
And yeah, it's a bit popular in certain
places as far as I know, but yeah, it's

241
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:18,000
nothing near local bitcoins. Yeah, what
was good about LocalBitcoins? So back

242
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:26,000
then, liquidity on exchanges was quite
crappy, right? Even on biggest ones like

243
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:34,000
MtGox, BTC back in 2013, for example. So,
it was hard to on-ramp, right?

244
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Yeah, yeah. Back then, it was super hard.
I mean, because LocalBitcoins was actually

245
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:47,000
out here in Japan. You know, as well,
there was a, you know, you could find some

246
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:52,000
people doing local Bitcoins, but yeah, it
was, like, a lot of times it would price

247
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:57,000
gouge because it was so difficult to
on-ramp money for Bitcoin back then. Yeah,

248
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:02,000
I mean, you know, even now with hodl hodl,
they still try to, still try to bullshit

249
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:07,000
you about that.

250
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,000
So like once in a while you actually find
somebody who just wants to trade, you

251
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,000
know, he wants to like, okay, I got some,
whatever, I'll buy some crypto from you or

252
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,000
I'll sell you some crypto or something
like that. And they'll just basically do

253
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
it at whatever the rate is. But then
there's the people that do it for a

254
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,000
living. And I get paying a somewhat of a
premium, but some of these guys want like

255
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
10%.

256
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
And then they give you some bullshit
about it. I was like, oh, well, you know,

257
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
a cash, it's something really stupid, like
cash is difficult to come by right now for

258
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Bitcoin. I'm like, no, it's not. What are
you talking about? No, it's not. It's not

259
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
difficult at all.

260
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Yeah, so it's like HODL HODL is actually
pretty OK. But it's still like there's not

261
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:02,000
like sometimes you'll find somebody to
trade with right away and you'll find

262
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:07,000
somebody good. But many times like a
limited amount of times you'll find

263
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:12,000
somebody really good. Most of the times
you'll find somebody who does it for a

264
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,000
living and they'll want to get at least
five to ten percent commission from you. I

265
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:22,000
mean, I think that's okay.

266
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
There's a premium to pay for it on KYC
nowadays I think there's a market for that

267
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
10% really.

268
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Oh, yeah, I hear you. They turn right
around and sell it at an exchange. I mean

269
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,000
10%. Yeah. And no, it's like, I remember a
few, I mean, I like, okay, I'd pay a few

270
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,000
percent, but not 10%. And 10% is
obnoxious. Especially if you're trading, I

271
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,000
mean, it's like, okay, you're trading like
some small amount or something. Still not

272
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,000
okay, but you know, it's doable. But if
you're asking somebody to, you know, to do

273
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,000
10% on like a $10,000 purchase, that's a
thousand bucks. I'm not gonna pay a

274
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,000
thousand bucks for that. For what? For
having some money on hand? I mean, and

275
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,000
it's not even that much money, so. Anyway.

276
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,000
I mean, we could do something like,
kushti, we could do something like this on

277
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Ergo with once messaging is in place, you
could build a dApp that's self-hosted so

278
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,000
nobody can shut it down with, you know, a
special format of putting those

279
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,000
peer-to-peer on-ramps on-chain in a
messaging block and just do it that way.

280
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:25,000
You could build that on-chain.

281
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Yeah, well, it was proposed by HQx to
use, unsurprisingly, MewFinance, so they

282
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:40,000
have some escrow contracts. And so, yeah,
I'm actually willing to try them. I don't

283
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:47,000
know. I need to check escrow contracts and
we need to think actually how to use. So,

284
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:54,000
yeah, I believe a lot of tooling is
already there, right, on Ergo. It's just

285
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:01,000
time to actually use it and find different
use cases for tooling available.

286
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:12,000
All right, and yeah, checking the charts.
Yeah, that is a good reminder from

287
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:20,000
CannonQ. So more than 27,000 ERG in
bounties are available for developers to

288
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:28,000
earn and move projects and ecosystem
forward.

289
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:36,000
There is link in the chat. I've posted
the link also just like one hour ago or

290
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:43,000
like that in the main group and yeah some
other groups and yeah it's also posting

291
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Ergo developers and so on so yeah
developers we have more than 27,000 ERG in

292
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:57,000
bounties in different projects and yeah in
different form also so it's not just ERG

293
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:04,000
so there are bounties in the ChainCash
repository denominated in Gluon.

294
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:12,000
There are some bounties in Rosen
repositories, denominated in RSN,

295
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:20,000
unsurprisingly. Then there are GORT, Gluon
Oracle reward token denominated bounties.

296
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:28,000
I believe still there are some in Oracle
repository and maybe some other repos.

297
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:37,000
There are some issues in Ergo repository,
so protocol client, reference protocol

298
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:44,000
client repository, denominated in Gluon
also so Gluon-based gold stablecoin and so

299
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:51,000
on so yeah a lot of things going on so
then when can we pay bounties to

300
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:58,000
developers in lithium that would be funny
it's the gold of 21st century right?

301
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Would be happy, actually. Yeah, for the
lithium-backed stablecoin. Yeah, that's

302
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:21,000
actually in development right now. Yeah,
after we have the initial... We're

303
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:31,000
actually talking to the same tokenomics
team that did our tokenomics zero one X.

304
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:41,000
And they're the ones that also did the
tokenomics for world mobile. So it's a

305
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:51,000
really good, it's a really good tokenomics
firm. There are partners.

306
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:57,000
And so we're going to, you know, I guess,
and also we'll plug you in and we'll talk

307
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:03,000
about initial kind of initial groundwork
for this because like they have, they have

308
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:09,000
a token right now on either ether polygon.
I can't remember exactly, but I think it

309
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:15,000
was polygon. But we were thinking about
bringing it over, but we might just have

310
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:21,000
to do a swap for the holders over there
because we probably just need to build it

311
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:27,000
from scratch to make sure that it does
what it's supposed to do.

312
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:37,000
But we'll see. Yeah, but very soon we'll
be able to do that. Very soon.

313
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Right nice because yeah I think tokenized
commodities as well as cross-chain assets

314
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:55,000
is what's needed right for producing
different and good kinds of money on top

315
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:04,000
of Ergo. And also to build the different
DeFi and so on.

316
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:10,000
That's the thing. Legacy financial
markets aren't just built on the stock

317
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:16,000
market and the bond market, but they're
also built on commodity market by a huge,

318
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:22,000
huge part. Price of gold, price of silver,
price of copper, all this stuff as a big

319
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:28,000
influence on other prices, price of oil,
and just economy in general.

320
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:36,000
So if we are going to be kind of the
antithesis of that market by doing it in a

321
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:41,000
decentralized way, we still need to
maintain some of the same basic principles

322
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:46,000
of just how markets work. You know, like
money needs to be backed by something at

323
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:51,000
some point. And I mean, you know, and say
in some cases it is hashrate, you know,

324
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:56,000
some cases it is computing power. So
that's also a commodity, you know, of its

325
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:01,000
own. But that comes from a commodity
called, you know, electric power or

326
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:06,000
energy.

327
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Yeah, exactly. So it's energy-based
money, basically.

328
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Yeah, exactly. So it's still a commodity,
so even with mining Ergo, you're literally

329
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:21,000
still in a commodity-based financial
system. But it's just a different. Yeah,

330
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:26,000
but we just need to have other ones as
well. We need to have lithium, we need to

331
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:31,000
have gold, we need to have other metals
and commodities that are essentials. Yeah,

332
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:36,000
absolutely needed.

333
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Yeah, and then, you know, so the point is
then, yeah, other forms of money such as

334
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:59,000
stable coins like the USDT and so on, so
that they should be... I mean, commodities

335
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:09,000
are really irreplaceable in many ways.

336
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Just the same with, you know, with gold.
I mean, why is gold still so popular? I

337
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:25,000
mean, obviously, you know, it's not used
for making coins anymore as much, but it's

338
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:32,000
still a hot commodity. And that's kind of
the, you know, the nature of a truly base

339
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:39,000
commodity like that because even now that
OK, we might back something with it. Why

340
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:46,000
do we back something with it? Because it
still has. Obviously, internationally, the

341
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:53,000
world agreed on value. That's number one.
Number two, it still has high utility.

342
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Even if you're not making coins from it,
like, say, back several hundred years ago,

343
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:07,000
you had gold coins people were paying
with. Now, you use it in electronics just

344
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:13,000
as much. In fact, right now, I would say
gold is more of an industrial metal than

345
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:19,000
than a jewelry precious metal. Again, I
don't know the statistics for that, but it

346
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:25,000
seems like the utility of gold in
electronics probably outweighs the utility

347
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:31,000
of gold in jewelry and just in its raw
form for monetary, for hedging value.

348
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:37,000
That's it. 500 years ago, who would have
known that gold would be supporting

349
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:41,000
electronic circuitry? And the same
circuitry that's actually being used to

350
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:45,000
mine Ergo right now. You need gold for
that. I mean, it's one of its unique

351
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:49,000
properties that it doesn't oxidize. So,
yeah, so that's yeah, it's it's like that.

352
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:53,000
And it's like that across the board. And I
think if we want to have a really a

353
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,000
thriving system, we need to adopt that. We
are adopting it as an ecosystem and Ergo,

354
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:01,000
you know, we have Gluon.

355
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:10,000
We're talking about algorithmic
commodities, which are actually really

356
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:15,000
interesting as well to explore. We might
even see later down the line to do a fully

357
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:20,000
algorithmic lithium-backed stablecoin
after we establish the Oracle network for

358
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:25,000
what we're doing. So yeah, quite a lot of
possibilities.

359
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Yeah. And actually, I had a talk with
Anon Real recently. So he made the

360
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:40,000
pronouncement on Twitter already. So he's
working on index funds. So then you may

361
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:46,000
have for lithium, which is like 20%
algorithmic and 80% physical, or whatever,

362
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:52,000
50-50. So that's also quite interesting.

363
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:57,000
A lot of interesting stuff going on.
Yeah, we should see something really soon.

364
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:01,000
So I think the community is going to be
really happy once we have some news coming

365
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:05,000
out. But anyway, guys, listen,
unfortunately, I have to drop off right

366
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:09,000
now.

367
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
What about questions?

368
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Well, I mean...

369
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Ducking the questions. Classic Dan.

370
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,000
You guys can do the questions. Well, get
QX to do something. He hasn't been really

371
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,000
doing much.

372
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,000
All right, so we have 15 minutes for
questions, actually.

373
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Yeah, yeah, guys. Guys, stay on. QX is
going to answer all your questions. Alex,

374
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,000
you're in charge.

375
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Yeah, so then I will message you after,
but maybe tomorrow because it's late,

376
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:39,000
right? On your side, sir.

377
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Yeah, yeah. Well, we still have a space
in about an hour. So yeah, it's okay. It's

378
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,000
okay. But anyway.

379
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,000
All right. So yeah, let's discuss.

380
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Thank you guys. Yeah, thank you.

381
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Bye, Dan.

382
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Bye, QX.

383
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:02,000
So, oh, that's, there we go. Andy's got
to fix our pictures. Let me sit up so

384
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:08,000
people can see us. There we go. Well, I'll
talk while he's fixing this. So hey,

385
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:14,000
kushti, I introduced, yesterday was
Wednesday, right, Tuesday, I introduced

386
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Cornell BRICK to, goodness, maybe 300, 400
students, the entire architecture classes,

387
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:26,000
and then some of our remote students in
New York City.

388
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,000
It was an interesting response. The
initial response, I think I saw some eye

389
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:36,000
rolls when I discussed that we were
integrating blockchain tech into our

390
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:40,000
stuff. And then I went on to explain a
little more about a system of trade value

391
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,000
between peer-to-peer people and a LETS
system, what we're trying to do. And then

392
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,000
their eyes lit up when they realized they
could use these tokens for credits for

393
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:52,000
free plotting, for free large format
printing initially. So that got their

394
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,000
attention. So right now, the system's all
set up.

395
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:06,000
I have the Tipperbot set up. I have my
front end and back end of the plot

396
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:10,000
submission stuff all set up to take the
Ergo payments for BRICK and so that's

397
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:14,000
ready to go and tested we just have to
work on a little bit of a tutorial to show

398
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:18,000
kids how to we've written text but these
guys like are visual so just need to make

399
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,000
a quick video on how to request or get a
tipper bot wallet and then we'll either

400
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,000
probably just tip out manually for now or
once that happens perhaps do an airdrop if

401
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:30,000
we can get kids to get their own address
and actually know what they're doing

402
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,000
that's.

403
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:44,000
I think they'll be better off with Tipper
Bot in the long run, but we'll see. So

404
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:48,000
that's pretty cool coming up. The funny
thing is, kushti, in the small group that

405
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,000
I was discussing this with, one of the
kids raised their hand and was like, can

406
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,000
we collect this and sell this? And I was
like, well, it's permissionless, because

407
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,000
you can do whatever the hell you want. But
if I find this token on a DEX and it has

408
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,000
some system of monetary value on it, that
may have some more tax implications that

409
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,000
I'm willing to deal with.

410
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:16,000
So I may just nuke the coin by reissuing
another one and airdropping it to

411
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:21,000
everybody that holds the old one. So we'll
see what happens. Hopefully it doesn't end

412
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:26,000
up on a DEX anywhere with a value attached
to it.

413
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Yeah, but you know, so what's good about,
you know, that's a permissionless finance,

414
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:40,000
you know, I mean, like, like totally
permissionless. So, it's easy, you know,

415
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:47,000
to try to find market value, right, if
any. And then, yeah, we may expect people

416
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:54,000
to try to find market value. Then, yeah, I
mean, you can try to sell anything. The

417
00:47:54,000 --> 00:48:01,000
question is who will buy it, right?

418
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:12,000
All right. So, yeah, let's jump on
questions. What do we have?

419
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Oh, a lot of messages, but there are
other questions. Hi, just two basic

420
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:22,000
questions, please. What is the basic
difference between Ergo simple send

421
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:27,000
transaction process? And why smart
contracts are possible on Ergo and not on

422
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Bitcoin. I mean difference between Ergo
and Bitcoin. So yeah, I see only one

423
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:37,000
question here, right? So difference
between Ergo and Bitcoin actually.

424
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Well, the first, I guess the first one's
he's asking if there's a difference

425
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:45,000
between send and receive transactions,
which there's not there. You just making

426
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:49,000
new boxes all the time between send and
receive. It's all about destroying boxes

427
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:53,000
and creating new boxes with permissions
for certain keys to access those boxes or

428
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:57,000
ownership of those boxes. That's all send
and receive is with UTXO, so that's easy.

429
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Sorry, kushti, go ahead and answer the
second part.

430
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Yeah, so basically a transaction is
about, well, destroying old programmable

431
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:13,000
digital monitoring notes, right, and
creating new ones, right, so there is no

432
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:19,000
send and receive, right, if we are taking
it on this low level. And then, yeah,

433
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:25,000
difference between Ergo and Bitcoin and
contracts. So in the first place, Bitcoin

434
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:31,000
is allowing for contracts, actually,
right, there were lots of proposals for

435
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Bitcoin and theoretically there are a lot
of contracts on Bitcoin utilizing

436
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:43,000
different techniques actually.

437
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Yeah, in the first place, what's good?
So, everything possible on Bitcoin is also

438
00:49:54,000 --> 00:50:02,000
possible on Ergo, right? So no exceptions
found to the moment. So multi signatures,

439
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:10,000
what else? Discrete lock contracts. Then,
yeah, adapter signature based how's it

440
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:18,000
called? Atomic swaps, yeah. And then,
yeah, simple hash-based atomic swaps.

441
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Yeah, so everything is possible on Ergo
and Bitcoin, right? But, well...

442
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Lightning Network channels, other layer 2
solutions, so they are possible. But Ergo

443
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:44,000
is allowing for a lot more because more
blockchain context is available during

444
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:53,000
transaction validation. There are certain
proposals for Bitcoin to be closer to Ergo

445
00:50:53,000 --> 00:51:02,000
rights as such as exposing spending
transaction to spending script of

446
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:11,000
transaction input but yet still not there.

447
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Then yeah, so simply a richer context and
then more opcodes and also, more

448
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:26,000
sophisticated cryptography, right, if
you're talking about Sigma protocols. So

449
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:32,000
you can easily do things which are hardly
doable or nearly impossible on Bitcoin so

450
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:38,000
for example there is Ergo Mixer right
which is non-interactive non-custodial

451
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:44,000
mixer and for Bitcoin there was a proposal
using a bit similar cryptography actually

452
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:50,000
yeah quite similar called CoinJoin but
yeah it was interactive in the first place

453
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:56,000
so there was need for some peer-to-peer
based bulletin board, right, for mixer

454
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:02,000
related messages.

455
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:16,000
And then, yeah, it also was quite hard to
implement, so there was some startup, but,

456
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:23,000
well, no delivery still. And, yeah, six
years actually passed since the original

457
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:30,000
CoinJoin proposal. So, Ergo Mixer
proposal, the protocol appeared around the

458
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:37,000
same time actually so 2018 right it was
when I came to the idea developing. So

459
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Alex had some thoughts, but his initial
construction was based on non-existing

460
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:51,000
cryptographic primitive.

461
00:52:55,000 --> 00:53:02,000
So I made a practical solution, then sent
it to Professor Rezin. And yes, some

462
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:09,000
modifications and then one of them was
implemented back in 2020, right? So just

463
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:16,000
months basically after the main net
launch. And yes, for Bitcoin CoinJoin

464
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:23,000
still there is no implementation. Yeah,
probably would never be. So, yeah, that's

465
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:30,000
the difference. So, in short, contracts, a
lot of contracts also possible in Bitcoin,

466
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:37,000
but in practice, we see only
multi-signatures and multi-signatures also

467
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:44,000
different on Ergo, more feature-rich.

468
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:54,000
And, yeah, Lightning Network, which is
not so popular for Bitcoin even still, I

469
00:53:54,000 --> 00:54:03,000
guess. And so, yeah, it's not implemented
by anyone on top of Ergo. Still.

470
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:08,000
Well, I think just from an outside
perspective, not outside, but a general

471
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:13,000
easy perspective to point to, right? And
part of what you said, right, is that Ergo

472
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:18,000
uses the eUTXO set, extended UTXO, as
opposed to Bitcoin, just UTXO. So as you

473
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:23,000
said in your dialogue there, that Ergo has
a much more opportunity for more

474
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:28,000
feature-rich contracts built into that
with that extended UTXO set.

475
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Making really cool things like escrow
contracts like you said the mixer like

476
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:45,000
what MewFinance is doing with our LP
fundraising all those kind of things it

477
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:52,000
makes for a very robust library of smart
contracts you can create compared to your

478
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:59,000
limitations on Bitcoin, so I think the
easy thing to think of is Ergo is kind of

479
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:06,000
like Bitcoin on steroids or Bitcoin 4.0 or
5.0. I don't want to say 2.0 because I

480
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:13,000
think it's more than 2.0, kushti.

481
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Around the main net launch so Cardano
presented it as Bitcoin 1.0 because you

482
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:29,000
know the Bitcoin is still about 0.20. His
idea was that it's kind of like finished

483
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Bitcoin, so Bitcoin 1.0, which may be seen
in decades if we are talking about the

484
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:43,000
grandfather. So, yeah, they're just
starting to discuss, possibility of

485
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:50,000
demurrage, tail emissions, and, yeah,
maybe they will spend, like, five to seven

486
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:57,000
years in another civil war on that.

487
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Let's see. I mean, there's that advantage
about Ergo, how fast things can pivot.

488
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:15,000
Yeah, Ergo was made kind of complete,
right, like Bitcoin 1.0 since day one. And

489
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:22,000
yeah, happily, it was flexible enough to
allow for non-breaking protocol updates.

490
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:29,000
But yeah, actually Bitcoin is also quite
good at that. Well, what the developers

491
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:36,000
did, like SegWit and Taproot, so yeah,
they are pure acts of art of software

492
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:43,000
capability, let's say.

493
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:51,000
All right, more questions?

494
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Let's see, we've got one. Oh, somebody's
asking about quantum processors again. I

495
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:01,000
know you spoke about this before, but
yeah.

496
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:10,000
So, nothing changed since the AMA. So,
but, but yeah, it seems dust settled,

497
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:19,000
right? So crypto is still standing. Yeah,
working and people now seem not worrying

498
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:28,000
so much, right? But yeah, there is need to
consider something.

499
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:33,000
We got somebody, Luke's asking about the
same comparison between Ethereum smart

500
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:37,000
contracts and Ergo smart contracts. Do you
have the bandwidth to talk about that,

501
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:41,000
kushti?

502
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:47,000
Yeah, but if we are talking about
Ethereum, so Ethereum is actually totally

503
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:53,000
different, right? So Bitcoin is following
a programmable money paradigm of Bitcoin,

504
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:59,000
and Ethereum is actually quite a different
beast. So yeah, it's how they call it, a

505
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:05,000
decentralized world computer. But yeah,
it's more like a replicated programmable

506
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:11,000
calculator, right? So very limited, kind
of computational device. Everyone in the

507
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:17,000
world has access to.

508
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:28,000
And so, yeah, they tried to sell
initially I know like yet decentralized

509
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:36,000
computer for all kinds of applications on
the blockchain so that that was the time

510
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:44,000
especially back in 2016-17 when yeah the
space finally got full with, you know,

511
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:52,000
enterprise evangelists, talking the same
mantra, basically, not Bitcoin, but

512
00:58:52,000 --> 00:59:00,000
blockchain. And the idea was that, you
don't need for those, you know, risky

513
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:08,000
uncontrollable peer to peer money.

514
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:13,000
So while you, yeah, that's control.
Decentralized applications like

515
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:18,000
decentralized Uber, I don't know why you
need for decentralized Uber, I mean who

516
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:23,000
needs for decentralized Uber? Who actually
may care even? I mean who cares? I mean if

517
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:28,000
taxi is coming from centralized server or
decentralized and also how do you measure

518
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:33,000
this decentralization? So if that's, I
don't know, decentralized Uber is

519
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:38,000
controlled by a few whales, right, and
decentralized Uber, how is it different

520
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:43,000
from board of directors, right, and
centralized and so on.

521
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:55,000
But yeah, I mean, it's still alive, I
believe, but now in even worse form. So

522
00:59:55,000 --> 01:00:01,000
Web3, right, so when, you know, I mean,
people are talking about Web3 projects, so

523
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:07,000
I think it's like grandsons of that
initial wave of absurd. But yeah, it's now

524
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:13,000
like complete absurd, so usually when you
listen about Web3 project, you may be

525
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:19,000
sure, I mean, it's pretty meaningless.

526
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:26,000
All right, and so, going back to
Ethereum, so, with time, all the

527
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:32,000
applications on Ethereum, after all, are
financial, right? And then the question is

528
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:38,000
why to build general purpose world
computer, right, which is still working on

529
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:44,000
financial applications on the right. And
so that actually was the Ergo value

530
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:50,000
proposition. That was our statement,
better to say, back in 2016-17, even,

531
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:56,000
right?

532
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:00,000
So it's a counteraction to all that's not
Bitcoin, but blockchain absurd. So, I say

533
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:04,000
it pretty clearly back then that, you
know, blockchain is totally inefficient

534
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:08,000
database, right? And, there is very little
hope it would
