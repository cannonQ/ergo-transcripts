00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Hello, and welcome back to the Ergo Dev
Update.

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I thought no better way to bring this
back after a few months of hiatus than to

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
have the original, the OG, sipping on his
amber ale, Joseph Armeanio.

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Good to be back.

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
How you doing, sir?

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Good. Cheers, everybody. It's nice to be
back on the Dev Update. What's new in

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
crypto land these days?

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Goodness. Wow. I don't know where to
start, Joe. I don't know where to start.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
All right. What pops in your head first,
I guess. And we'll just paddle forward

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
from there.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Well, let me I got something. All right.
So here's here. So I've, a lot of you

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
watching maybe know that I've launched the
BRICK token. But the funny thing is, let

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
me open my I'm open my email here because
I want to read a verbatim. So I have to,

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
you know, you kind of have to launch this
stuff and send out mass emails to

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
students, which also hit faculty, which
also has staff.

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
So when I'm writing this thing, I'm
writing about blockchain usage. I'm

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
writing about Ergo platform and why we
chose to use it for this purpose. I get a

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
whole email done and I'm thinking for a
second, Oh man, it still reads like, Oh,

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
you're going to get airdropped and that
kind of thing. And it just triggers these

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
things in my head, like these meme token
crap scams kind of stuff.

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
So I literally, I put a message at the
end. Let me find it. I put one sentence at

22
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
the end of talking about Ergo, I said, and
yes, we're fully aware of how ridiculous

23
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
90% of the blockchain antics have been. So
welcome to some actual meaningful usage of

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
this technology.

25
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
So it's so sad that I have to put that
in. And then after that, I see like, what

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
was it? A couple of days ago, a Senator
released a token, USA token or something

27
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
like that. And we're going to make this
the best financial.

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Every micro celebrity and influencer out
there has their own thing now, huh? It's

29
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
unexpected, I guess.

30
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
It is. I mean, this happens in the fiat
world all the time, right? So why would we

31
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
not expect it here in the crypto space?

32
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I think that you just have to say, okay,
well, as soon as you create something like

33
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
that, what are you really doing as you're
creating a currency war, right? And so

34
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
then the assumption is going to be that
people are going to at some point, move

35
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
towards the better currency. I don't see
it as really any more complicated than

36
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,000
that. It's a weird space.

37
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:07,000
We're in weird time but it is there's
really there's really nothing like new

38
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:14,000
under the sun right just new front end I'm
just waiting for like a senator to do

39
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:21,000
something on pump fun or something That's
the next step right so that got me

40
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:28,000
thinking they got me thinking too like
what's

41
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
And I hope no central exchanges are
watching this right now, but I'm thinking

42
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
what's besides a fiat on ramp? What's the
usage? What's a forecast for a central

43
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
exchange in the future? You know, the only
thing that can come to my mind to think of

44
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
what these things will evolve into in the
future. The only thing that came to my

45
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
mind is most of these things are just
going to be

46
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
online casinos are going to devolve into
an online casino or evolve into an online

47
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
casino. You're gonna put your money up
there. They're not going to want you to

48
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
move it anywhere else because you're
there. You know, you're their cash cow.

49
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
And then they're going to want you to
spend it there. So what else, they're

50
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
going to turn into some sort of payment
portal where everything comes to then you

51
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
buy things you gamble.

52
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Yeah, I mean, like, I don't know, I have
my own thoughts. I would say that yeah,

53
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,000
okay, you're probably going to see a lot
of, I don't know, ramping, which, one of

54
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,000
the useful things about centralized stable
coins is they have the ability to sink

55
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,000
liquidity into the bond market, right? So
if you look at USDC, USDT, what are they

56
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,000
holding? Government bonds, right?

57
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
So it is somewhat interesting to say,
okay, well, if I'm in government and I

58
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
have a lot of debt that I have to roll
over. Having these new ways of sinking

59
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
liquidity into the bond market to like
offset demand based on the amount of debt

60
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I need to roll over might make sense,
right?

61
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Then you also have like the custodial
aspect I think is kind of interesting,

62
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
right? Now you can say like Coinbase is
building out this entire suite that's like

63
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
onboarding I guess more traditional
markets and they're the ultimately like

64
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
the key holder in that situation. So maybe
that's useful for retail, but that's not

65
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
new either. I think a lot of people have
just used exchanges as their wallet,

66
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
hoping they didn't get hacked.

67
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
A lot of people just don't have the
ability to understand what self custody

68
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
is. I mean, I have these people that I
know that were family members from

69
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
marriage are into crypto before I was.
And, they called me the other day to help

70
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,000
them, recover funds from whatever that
payout was. It wasn't Mt. Gox, but one of

71
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
those kind of things where they're letting
you go in and pull out some USDT or

72
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
something like that in a fraction of what
you actually originally had.

73
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
So one of those things that I was helping
them pull it out and I was like, what's

74
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
your address? And they're like, Oh, my
Coinbase address is this. I was like, No,

75
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
no, what's your, what's your wallet
address yourself? Something like you have

76
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
a hardware key or anything like that? Oh,
no, I just keep it on the exchange. So

77
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
it's unfortunately just the exchanges job,
right? It's a keep you there,

78
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
unfortunately, and people don't educate
beyond that.

79
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:36,000
So yeah. I mean, the space is weird, man.
Like I onboarded into crypto by syncing

80
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:43,000
nodes. Like that was like my first
activity or touchpoint.

81
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Was that your first wallet? A node
wallet?

82
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Yeah, yeah. I was like, wow, this Bitcoin
thing is pretty interesting. I'm going to

83
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
sync a node.

84
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Oh, wow, nice.

85
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:01,000
But that's kind of very foreign. Now it's
like the president has a shit coin,

86
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:10,000
everybody, quick. I don't know what to
say. Like those things happen. I'm like.

87
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
It's not even a sane response to that
kind of thing. The president of the United

88
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
States is rugged. Probably not.

89
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Let's be honest. I don't see him having
like, Oh, no, not him specifically right

90
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
now.

91
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
He's not running the token himself. But
it's whatever whoever he's hired or

92
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
whoever he's given permission to do this.

93
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I'm sure that's always the downside is
there's always coat tailors. Somebody

94
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
that's just around him that wants to
leverage that power privilege position,

95
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
whatever. But that's not new either.

96
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
No, no, that's true. It's just blatant in
the open, I guess. I guess it's

97
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
transparent, right? That's hell of a
transparent.

98
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
It seems to have really destroyed the, I
don't know, the meme narrative that was

99
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
going there for a bit. I guess a lot of
people put their liquidity into the Trump

100
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
token and then, that started dumping on
everybody and it seems to have pulled a

101
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
lot of liquidity out of other meme
projects and Who knows maybe Donald Trump

102
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
destroyed shit coins, right?

103
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
That's kind of a So went down 20% or
something when when the Trump token dumped

104
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
or something I forget I have something
like that. Yeah

105
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
It's a weird space like that. I mean, on
one hand, it's like we have these people

106
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,000
that are saying, hey, we're going to try
to build systems with open source code

107
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,000
that redistribute kind of power
assumptions and oftentimes offer like

108
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
privacy and utility. And then on the other
side, you have users that don't care about

109
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
code at all. I mean, a lot of times it's
just a picture. They don't really care

110
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
about assumptions. They don't really care
about privacy. They don't really care

111
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
about, well, much other than, is it green
or red? And these things happen.

112
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I mean, the downside to financial
nihilism is equal to the upside, which is

113
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:25,000
kind of infinite. So there you go.

114
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Well, in these situations, I tend to find
myself just putting my head down and being

115
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,000
on whatever track I was on before for what
reason I was on before. And that's

116
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
building on Ergo, right? That's finding
real life use cases for Ergo, finding

117
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
actual meaningful, as I said, reasons to
utilize the blockchain. And the other

118
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
stuff's just noise to me. It feels
temporary, right? It feels like, OK, this

119
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
is just the windstorm blowing over. This
is a hype. This is extra value extraction.

120
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,000
This is what these people are going to do.

121
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Eventually, they're going to run out of
people to, maybe hopefully they're going

122
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,000
to run out of people to fleece down those
kind of numbers. And then, we'll still be

123
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
there. And projects like Ergo are still
going to be there building and way ahead

124
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
of the game who are just trying to value
extract. So that's the way I look at it.

125
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I think that if you're going to look at
how you deal with things in life, you got

126
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,000
to have humor. Otherwise, it is a crazy
space. A lot of the times, if I'm talking

127
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
to like your average person, I just say,
Hey, I helped contribute to open source

128
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
software. And they say, Oh, well, what's
that? And it's like, well, it's free. You

129
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,000
can look inside of it and understand it.
And I start talking about closed versus

130
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
open systems.

131
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Now I'm sure there are a lot of people
that their first touch point in crypto is.

132
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:12,000
A lot of these key opinion leaders who, I
don't know, based on the look of it, were

133
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:21,000
like fatherless or something. But I'm just
honest, and yeah, I don't know. It's a

134
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:30,000
weird space. And I think everybody should
have fair warning about that. And

135
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:39,000
hopefully, people do, that there is a lot
of just grift, vapor world.

136
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
So have we been in a situation
historically? And my memory is usually

137
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
always hard to remember these kind of
things, even things I read in history,

138
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
historically of this kind of not
necessarily in the financial market, but

139
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
in other markets.

140
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
It's been free banking before. where you
have a bunch of people creating their own

141
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,000
personal currencies and usually it's
rampant with inflations and scams and

142
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
things to blow up. But I think that
usually we didn't have the technology to

143
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,000
actually see and understand it. Now we
actually do, which is fascinating, right?

144
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Like you can watch, I don't know, say you
pick a scam project on some chain. You can

145
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,000
actually look.

146
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Throw dirt. You'll hit one, right? It
doesn't matter.

147
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I mean, you can understand distribution.
You can understand like an element of

148
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
what's happening not that people pay
attention or that it doesn't matter I

149
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
mean, it's the same thing.

150
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I mean with chains, right? We have full
transparency. We see what's locked. We see

151
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
what's not locked We see how many people
are holding the majority of the Treasury.

152
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
It doesn't matter the same thing happens
That would happen in a closed system where

153
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
people are fleeced out in the fiat system
world So it's the in that case. I feel

154
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
like for the normal person 90% of the
people it doesn't matter

155
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,000
You know, they don't understand what it
means that, oh, the token holder for the

156
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Trump token owns 80%, has 80% of the
tokens ready to dump into the buy pressure

157
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,000
kind of thing. So I don't know.

158
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Always great power comes great
responsibility.

159
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I don't know. I just think Ergo has
always been in the right place. It doesn't

160
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,000
matter if there's a hurricane out there or
a tornado and people are falling for

161
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,000
anything. Ergo is still steadily building
and doing, I think, the right thing.

162
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I think we just need to look at it from
the perspective of we're trying to create

163
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:50,000
an open neutral network, right? And
deliver assumptions that people that want

164
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:56,000
to understand will, right? Like, just
because blockchain is available to

165
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:02,000
everybody, probably doesn't mean everybody
should use it at this point, right? But

166
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,000
it's there, right? Having the code open
and available to everybody doesn't

167
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:14,000
necessarily mean that much to many people,
but it's there.

168
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
There are ways to implement it too that
are transparent to the user, but still

169
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
beneficial in the sense of using the
blockchain like when we were releasing the

170
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
BRICK token.

171
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Listen, technology will not solve human
nature. That's the end all be all of this

172
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:42,000
discussion is that you have that side of
human nature where people will want money

173
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:49,000
in profit for no work, no input. We'll
have people that will try to grift other

174
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:56,000
people and try to take advantage of them.

175
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I think ultimately it's about creating
clear trust assumptions that are available

176
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:08,000
for people that appreciate that. At this
point, many people won't. But historically

177
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:14,000
in crypto, the most valuable marketing
moments are not from the industry itself.

178
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:20,000
It's when there is some bellwether event
outside of crypto, whether it's Cyprus

179
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:26,000
screws over their depositors or Canada
starts censoring truckers' bank accounts.

180
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:32,000
And then people start saying, hey, wait a
second, what's the assumption that I have

181
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:38,000
as a user in this system? And they start
looking for something better. That's what

182
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:44,000
drives people into really looking at, I
guess, systems that distribute power.

183
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,000
So we have a tough battle with crypto
though, right? Because I don't think so.

184
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,000
It is, I think it's inevitable, but I
think it's a road ahead because those

185
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:04,000
people who are debanked or feel strangled
by that kind of thing, like you just

186
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,000
mentioned, They're not going to jump into
something that all they've heard about is

187
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,000
a scam or rugpulls or that kind of thing,
or, the consensus of what crypto is.

188
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,000
That's the beauty of an open network in a
way. Like if you have some regulatory body

189
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,000
that's like, Hey everybody, you have to
behave and act in a certain way. You just

190
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,000
kind of defeated the point. So that's the
downside to not having censorship. That's

191
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,000
the downside to not having a central party
that's babysitting everybody. And you just

192
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,000
have to be aware of that. Right. And
that's always going to be a risk in an

193
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,000
open system.

194
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:57,000
So to some degree, I would say, yeah, you
should approach these things with like an

195
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:03,000
element of caution and be aware of
pretentious malicious actors, but the

196
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:09,000
system itself is designed with pretty
clear assumptions of how it works in the

197
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:15,000
face of a malicious actor. That's more or
less the point.

198
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Yeah, I'm looking at, well, you're
talking, I'm looking at looking at

199
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:30,000
DuckPools and I see that, it's crazy to me
that Sigmanauts pool and DuckPools has an

200
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:36,000
APY of 28.9%. Like in any market, any like
sane market, that's an amazing yield

201
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:42,000
return, right? But in crypto, you have to
like remind people that it's there,

202
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,000
that's.

203
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I mean, I think you need to recognize
that yield is more or less an open term in

204
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:06,000
crypto. And it's important to understand
like where yield comes from first and

205
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:14,000
foremost, right? Like 28%, real yield is
pretty impressive. But when you look at it

206
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:22,000
side by side versus like money printing
yield from some token that just, put your

207
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:30,000
token here and give you more tokens. You
know, it is true. You got to know where

208
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:38,000
your yield comes from. Otherwise you might
be the yield, right?

209
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Yeah. Let me show this, Joe. We'll take a
break for a second. I'm going to switch to

210
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
something just to show everybody. Let's
see if I can switch to this. Oh,

211
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
fantastic.

212
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,000
All right. So here's an example. So I
just want to show people how simple we've

213
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:04,000
tried to make it for students who are
using BRICK token to pay for their plots

214
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,000
for that incentive. So we filled out the
information. We've uploaded our plot.

215
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,000
We're choosing blockchain payment here.
We're submitting the print job, and gosh,

216
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I hope I didn't submit something big.
Let's see. No, that was nice and small.

217
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,000
OK, so it instructs you to go to the
blockchain server on Discord. And if

218
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,000
you'll notice, there's a new message in
blockchain payments. And there we go. It

219
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,000
tells me that it's me, that it's six
bucks, and it's either 4.4 ERG or 54

220
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:40,000
BRICK. So I just copy the BRICK. And
before I do that, let's go to the admin

221
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,000
side. You can see that my print is not
there, right? This is what the backend

222
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,000
admin sees. So it's not released yet.

223
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:57,000
So as soon as we hit this, I have sent
the wallet the appropriate amount of

224
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:03,000
BRICK. And I guess we wait two minutes.
We'll check back in a little bit. We'll

225
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:09,000
see that that print should be released
soon on this page.

226
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
So the reason I'm showing this is because
what I mentioned earlier is that I don't

227
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
think you need to necessarily with
everybody, dive them into, not everybody

228
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
needs like, okay, here's your wallet,
here's your seed phrase, maybe explain how

229
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
that works. But an intro to the blockchain
can be as easy as this, right? None of

230
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,000
these students are knowing, essentially, I
mean, in the explanation video, I tell

231
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
them, here's how you setup, here's what a
seed phrase is, that kind of thing. But

232
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
they don't need to setup a wallet, right?
If they're doing these kind of simple

233
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
back and forth, peer-to-peer payments,
this kind of simple method, of course. All

234
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
they're using is Tipperbot. To them, the
blockchain is very transparent. For all

235
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
they know, it's some Discord app that
they're running on, right? But we're

236
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
running it on the blockchain, on
peer-to-peer nodes, so that, let's say

237
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
something bad happens, right? Let's say
somebody takes my token and makes an ERG

238
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
pair with it on Mew or something.

239
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,000
That's something I don't want to happen
because I don't want to deal with tax

240
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
issues in Cornell. So we'll just nuke it,
make a new token, airdrop it to everybody

241
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
except that asshole who made the trading
pair against our wishes on the DEX,

242
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
essentially, and just reprogram that with
a couple lines of programming into our

243
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
backend, and that's it. So that's the
beauty of the blockchain. It's such a

244
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,000
benefit to at least the developers and the
tooling that Ergo has. And to the

245
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
students, it can be very transparent and
extremely robust and simple to use.

246
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:51,000
So I think there's a huge use case in the
Ergo ecosystem. I mean, that's kind of

247
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:57,000
where you get into this idea of stateless
clients or ultra light clients. where, you

248
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:03,000
know, abstraction usually means you're
putting additional layers of trust in

249
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:09,000
between users and the blockchain, right?
So it's like you're tracking to a higher

250
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:15,000
layer, you're kind of further away from, I
guess, optimal security assumptions. And

251
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:21,000
our ability to build low, potentially with
like one click

252
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,000
applications where people don't
necessarily need to know that they're

253
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,000
basically operating with the assumptions
of a full node is pretty magic. I think

254
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:37,000
that's a huge green area for the Ergo
ecosystem to explore as a whole and I

255
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,000
really think that sub-blocks will be a
driver of that because then you're no

256
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,000
longer waiting for block time, which
again, if you're talking about general

257
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:52,000
users, I'd say a lot of them don't
understand the assumption of settlement

258
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,000
with no have no clue what that is bank
money anyway, I mean,

259
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Well, even, even people in the
blockchain, they don't understand why an

260
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
exchange would want 10 blocks on Ergo or
20 blocks on Ergo or, a couple blocks on

261
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Bitcoin or a couple on Ethereum. They
don't understand why that's important and

262
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
what that means for finality.

263
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Well, go ask, go ask your mother what,
settlement looks like when you're trading

264
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
a stock. I have no idea. Most of them,
right?

265
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,000
No, right. with stocks, with stocks, it
gets hairy, right? Because, they're

266
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,000
supposed to transfer ownership physically,
right, at some point, or electronically.

267
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
And then then you have people lending out
those shares that you're actually having

268
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,000
on their platform without your knowledge,
or you sign something, you clicked, okay,

269
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
on a box somewhere, and now they can lend
your shares out to other people. So you

270
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,000
get these divisions. So that's insane. So

271
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:53,000
No, but it's the same concept really. I
mean, most people that operate within

272
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:59,000
traditional finance have no idea what kind
of demon is behind that door, right? And

273
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:05,000
that's true with the banking system.
That's true with most traditional markets

274
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:11,000
and, more or less people don't care.
Right. They just have an assumption. Okay.

275
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Well, it should work and, hopefully things
settle properly. Right. And if they don't,

276
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:23,000
that's always its own rabbit hole. But I
don't think that's going to change.

277
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Like we can have a system with clear
assumptions of settlement and kind of

278
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:33,000
looking at finality of proof of work.
blah, blah, blah, most general end users

279
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:38,000
are not going to really dive into that
rabbit hole. And I think we can still

280
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,000
deliver optimal security assumptions
without them needing to know. Which, I

281
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:48,000
think that's like the best long-term
course to say, okay, well, if we're gonna

282
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:53,000
look at this as a global, open, neutral
network, how do we protect users? and try

283
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:58,000
to build, systems that we would want to
use understanding kind of the back into

284
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,000
the system itself.

285
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Yeah. It still seems so far away. But but
it seems it seems doable. That's for sure.

286
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Or else I wouldn't be doing this there.

287
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,000
I'm sure, I have no idea how complicated
legacy tech stacks are at this point. how

288
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:30,000
many people does it keep to keep it from
self-destructing. Cause a lot of them are

289
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:35,000
quite old, right? They've been built on
for years and years and years and years

290
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:40,000
and years. And that's hard to say you get
into, some complexity with legacy software

291
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,000
that, I wouldn't want to do that. I
wouldn't want to manage it or maintain it.

292
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:50,000
So let's see.

293
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,000
So speaking of circumventing banks and
central exchanges, how is how's Rosen

294
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:02,000
going, Joe?

295
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Good. Listen, Rosen requires a lot of
testing, right? Like, like open source

296
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:12,000
software is not sexy business. I hate to I
hate to inform everybody out there. No,

297
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:17,000
it's not.

298
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
It is tough struggle. Yep.

299
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,000
It is the least sexy thing ever because
you need to back test it to where you

300
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:30,000
release your code to the public and you
don't have vulnerabilities, both kind of

301
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,000
in the system that can be exploited. And
it takes a lot of testing, right? Build,

302
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:40,000
test, fix, build, test, fix, build, test,
fix, build, test, fix. It is not exciting

303
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,000
work, but I do think that the capabilities
if we build a lot of these systems are

304
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:50,000
pretty awesome.

305
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,000
So we did have a bug show up in one of
the rounds of testing in Binance Smart

306
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Chain. And so then it took a week to say,
hey, we need to first figure out why this

307
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,000
is happening and then patch it and then
run end-to-end tests. And I think we're

308
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
good on that. So I'm going to say Binance
soon, TM, right? But to me, it's just

309
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,000
funny because ever since I've kind of been
around publicly, that's probably one of

310
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,000
the most

311
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:31,000
I'm like, listen, this is not, this is
not Asian Jesus, right? He's not even

312
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:39,000
involved anymore. Anyway, but, so for me,
it's, it's like a spiritual victory to be

313
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:47,000
able to say, okay, everybody gets Binance
and BSC environment now.

314
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,000
I think, I think, I think at least the,
the core people in Ergo now, at least have

315
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,000
finally understood what a listing means,
right? Not that it's, that it's not a,

316
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,000
let's pump it a couple bucks because the
listing is coming and that's, sure.

317
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,000
They're going to profit off whatever
they're buying and selling low, buying

318
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,000
high, selling low. Or the reverse, but I
think I really think at least the

319
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,000
sentiment seems to be that people are now
understanding that listings are about

320
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,000
access, right? It's about access to with
cracking. It's about access to US

321
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,000
customers and just getting it so that
people have a way on to the Ergo

322
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,000
blockchain from there. So I'm really happy
at the sentiment there because you're

323
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:27,000
right.

324
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,000
And I think that even Rosen has had
pretty decent ERG depth on Cardano like

325
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,000
that becomes an easier on ramp.

326
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:42,000
And that's what we said to, that's what
we said to, oh gosh, what's his name? I've

327
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,000
lost track of all the Kraken people that
we've been talking to. Peter, that's his

328
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:52,000
name, Peter Dimitrakos. So that's exactly
what we said to Peter, right? We have as

329
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:57,000
much liquidity out there on the Cardano
chain that we do, and at least it was on

330
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Gate, a couple other exchanges put
together. So Gate put in two applications

331
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:07,000
recently, and I pinged the guy and he
said, thanks. Hopefully we hear something

332
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:12,000
back soon from that to get better access.

333
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:20,000
I know I'd love to Yeah, I would
definitely say that like historically

334
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:25,000
that's that's been one that I tend to
favor. It's an interesting business.

335
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:30,000
They've been in I don't know, position of
pressure, at least for the last, like,

336
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,000
political environment. And it's
interesting to see how that's going to

337
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:40,000
change moving forward for them, to be
honest. I know that, like, they're

338
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:45,000
bringing back staking products, which may
or may not even be good for proof of stake

339
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:50,000
chains. But, it certainly gives them a
little bit more room to try to innovate

340
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,000
and compete and, kind of build their own
thing. Let's see.

341
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Let's see. It'll be interesting. jury's
out for me about what they'll turn into or

342
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,000
what they'll be in the far future.

343
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:14,000
But I think that sometimes we forget how
small of a space we are.

344
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
That is true, too.

345
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Like crypto is its own little niche
environment where it is true that, if we

346
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:28,000
do have, changes to where you can, open up
a bank rails from your financial

347
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:34,000
institution to the back end of chains,
even if it is, some centralized shit. that

348
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:40,000
certainly opens the competition, wide
beyond where it is now. And, considering,

349
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:46,000
the financial depth of the purse of some
of the institutions around, Coinbase is

350
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:52,000
small beans compared to some of the larger
competitors. So let's see. Let's see. it's

351
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:58,000
one of those things where yes, they have
an element of like,

352
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:07,000
I don't know. They have Head Start, but
in terms of raw consumer base.

353
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
They don't have that. That's for sure.

354
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:13,000
They don't have anything. They're a
middle man. And if things move to where,

355
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:18,000
the bank infrastructure has some access
into crypto land, Rosen will back end it.

356
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Like that'll be a priority.

357
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Yeah. Let's take Bank of America Chase,
right? Let's decided to do direct Vietnam

358
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,000
ramps to places from the bank, Kraken
would be shitting their pants.

359
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,000
They do not have the element of power
that they, appear to have. The only thing

360
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,000
they have right now is, is a head start
and like they've had a certain like

361
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,000
regulatory advantage that might disappear.
So it might be a double edged sword for

362
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,000
them actually improved, regulatory
environment. Let's see. Business can be

363
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,000
like that sometimes, right? Where, it's
like, wow, this is going to be great for

364
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,000
this market. And it's like, well, actually
it just opened the market. So now you

365
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,000
actually have to compete. Let's see.

366
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Well, speaking of sub-blocks, it would
have been nice to have sub-blocks tonight

367
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,000
because we got a long block. So I'm
waiting to show you the other end of this

368
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,000
process, but we got quite a long one.

369
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,000
One of the assumptions everybody should
have in life. I always do. Whenever I'm

370
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
trying to do something and I have
something else to do, it's always like the

371
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
long block.

372
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
A watched block never prints, right?

373
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Yeah, you just don't look. You have to
pretend.

374
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
I've been refreshing for 10 minutes now.

375
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Yeah, don't look. You're making it longer
now.

376
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Damn it.

377
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Difficulty adjustments are going up every
time you hit refresh.

378
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:48,000
That is true. That is true. All right,
let's jump in to see what we've got here

379
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:53,000
in the dev update this week. And I'll keep
the other thing in the background and pop

380
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:58,000
over to it when it confirms.

381
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,000
All right, I'll start off.

382
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Go for it.

383
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:09,000
We've got C8 with Dexy Gold integration,
ETA, a few weeks. How's that a Rosen a few

384
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:14,000
weeks or you think a legitimate few weeks,
Joe?

385
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
It's done when it's done.

386
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,000
It's like something like that. So
Donnie's got porting end user relevant

387
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Scala tester JS mock chain done UI concept
for user swap liquidity interaction. Don't

388
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,000
want to five lib level actions LP swap ERG
Dexy Gold remaining. Bank freemint, bank

389
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,000
payment, LP mint liquidity tokens, LP
redeem liquidity tokens, other things

390
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,000
required for release, mempool server
integration, and UI integration

391
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,000
miscellaneous, looking into ErgyPay
integration.

392
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,000
That's always great. I always forget, at
least, how much of the world is on mobile

393
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,000
phones. So that kind of stuff is
necessary.

394
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Actually, that's one thing that surprises
me always. I don't know. Maybe I'm old.

395
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Maybe I just lose my phone too much. But
for me, it's like that is a terrible idea.

396
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Like the last cell phone I had a rental
with my car. Why would I want to put my

397
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
money?

398
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Oh, here we go, Joe. It worked. We got a
confirmed block. So as soon as the block

399
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:20,000
is confirmed, The plot then shows up here.
So I have a scanner scanning every like 10

400
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:25,000
seconds to make sure the payment was made
and it was confirmed. And then the

401
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:30,000
students, the student workers that we have
can then plot this. So I'm going to delete

402
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:35,000
this before my silly student waste paper
plot. Let's go back up to this.

403
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,000
All right. You've got the, you've got the
next one with kushti, the man himself.

404
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:45,000
All right, so we're talking about input
ordering blocks. He's got transactions

405
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:50,000
packed into the input blocks properly with
ordering full block structures making

406
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:55,000
progress. Linking also works now in local
miner-based DevNet. He's doing an API for

407
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:00,000
best input block field and added to the
info made. So yeah, with Sigma, it looks

408
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,000
like all issues found in Sigma 6.0 have
been fixed. So we're going to proceed with

409
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:10,000
the public test net activation.

410
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Awesome. Yeah, he's going to send me that
file today or tomorrow, I think. And we're

411
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:22,000
down to one miner on test net, just to
make it easy. And I'm going to spin that

412
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:27,000
6.0 up and mine to it. And then he's going
to do some tests. So really excited about

413
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:32,000
that.

414
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:40,000
All right, we've got Anon BR from the
Nautilus team for Fleet SDK, version 0.8.2

415
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:46,000
release, fixed zigzag encoding for ascent
type, fixed signed spite encoding, added

416
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:52,000
fuzzing tests for all numeric types. I
like the way Anon talks. Improved

417
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:58,000
round-trip tests by adding sigma state JS
serializer comparison to ensure that

418
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:04,000
encoding decoding output is the same in
both libs.

419
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,000
For Nautilus, finished the rework of most
of the most complex and time-consuming

420
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,000
component in Nautilus, the transaction
sign component. Migrated from dialogue to

421
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,000
drawer component for improved mobile
experience. Added several minor UI fixes

422
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,000
and code quality improvements.

423
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Awesome. Well, it looks like next we're
going to cover ChainCash.

424
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Oh, yeah. Looks like kushti removed the
refund-related registers and actions. as

425
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:36,000
refund can be replaced with note
redemption, added note registration

426
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:41,000
contract. And as always, he's continuing
to think about different L2 options.

427
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:50,000
One of the big benefits of Ergo is that
we have a footprint in the Bitcoin design

428
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:57,000
space. And there's a huge mind share out
there in terms of potential ways to build

429
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:04,000
on top of Bitcoin or improve Bitcoin.
generally never go anywhere, but it

430
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:11,000
creates a huge research and mind share
space that we can potentially draw from.

431
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:18,000
And it's nice to see, Cardano is probably,
ahead of us as well, with Midgard and

432
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Hydra and different layer two options. So
it does give us like a nice knowledge base

433
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:32,000
to build from, which, sometimes that's a
great resource in engineering.

434
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,000
All right, what else do we have here? Oh,
kushti's done SigmaUSD Oracle Pool and

435
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,000
SigmaUSD Bank Update and managed to update
Oracle Pool in the testnet to v1 with

436
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,000
update contract allowing for the update to
v2. Next is mainnet update. Let's do a

437
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,000
mainnet update to the same contract for
now and continue discussions about limits.

438
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Yeah, that's going to be a nice
coordinated test. We have to drop down to,

439
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:01,000
I believe, four SigmaUSD Oracle members,
maybe even three, to test it out, update

440
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:06,000
the code all at once to make sure it
works. So it's going to be kind of like,

441
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:11,000
hey, let's be available this time. Let's
do it and get it done. So looking forward

442
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:16,000
to that.

443
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Yeah. Oh, you got your buddy here.
Perfect.

444
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
All right, who's next? Aberg.

445
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Oh, it's Beene, she's got Sigma Rust.
Revealed global deserialized and SS

446
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:33,000
strings PRS by two sec. But yeah, there
you go. Aberg all for you. Satergo.

447
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:40,000
All right. So with Satergo, the wallet
format update is done. What's left is

448
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:46,000
bring it all together. Releasing the
Android signer app APK native binaries for

449
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Hetzner at API used for ledger. So hit the
cat button.

450
00:38:52,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Oh yeah. Let's see what else we have.
Minotaur.

451
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Oh, yeah. Minotaur 2.4.0 released. Minor
changes. Display token detail on

452
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:11,000
transaction signing page. Allow multiple
token burning on burn token page. Gosh,

453
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Joe, it took me like, I'd say two years in
crypto before I trusted that burn button

454
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:21,000
in Minotaur. It does, right? I did it on a
wallet that just had like junk tokens that

455
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:26,000
I was trying to clean out. So I did it
there, got a little more comfortable,

456
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:31,000
reading the transactions, making sure,
yep, yep, here's the input, here's the

457
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:36,000
output, missing these, we're getting these
tokens back, don't worry, kind of thing,

458
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:41,000
and doing it, but that's funny. Sorry,
yeah, what's that?

459
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
I said I had a spam wallet for a little
bit where I would just send them and say,

460
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
okay, it's a miners problem now, right?

461
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Yeah, yeah, it is. We'll pick it up in
the Sigmanauts pool, right?

462
00:39:54,000 --> 00:40:01,000
I got a little overwhelmed. So I gave my
seed phrase to Rustin.

463
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Every time people like to be nonsense, it
goes to Rustin.

464
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,000
So feel like that time you tipped out, I
don't know, $1,000 worth of GreasyCex to

465
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,000
somebody.

466
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:17,000
I see updated address asset details page
to display token icon and ID and name.

467
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Display token detail and transaction
generate page. Updated transaction box

468
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:27,000
display page to display token ID and icon.
Display transaction details. Display all

469
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:32,000
values comma separated. Animated QR code
display and scanning. Ooh, fancy. Added

470
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:37,000
transaction display page.

471
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:43,000
I have, oh, this is my cold wallet right
here. It's one of these little tiny palms.

472
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:48,000
They were like, I bought it when it was
like 80 bucks. But then like six months

473
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:53,000
later, they are like 150. Maybe they're
back down now, but it's beautiful. It's

474
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:58,000
run on Android. But man, it chunks along
on Minotaur on this little tiny hardware.

475
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:03,000
So it'd be funny to see some sort of
animated animation. QR code scan.

476
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Interesting.

477
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:16,000
All right. Patch changes. Do not display
token with amount equal to zero. Fixed bug

478
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:22,000
in the scanner. Fixed token select order.
Updated dependencies. Minotaur icons. And

479
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:28,000
that's the git, I believe. Right there.

480
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:34,000
I think that C8's message there is pretty
awesome. That I think is a long-term goal

481
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:40,000
for this year going for the layer 1 UX. C8
is championing that right with his Dexter

482
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:46,000
UI He's got a SigmaUSD bank UI that he's
doing. That's great, too where if we can

483
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:52,000
deliver people kind of this low layer one
user experience where things don't need to

484
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:58,000
be abstracted across

485
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:05,000
multiple environments and it is true that
mempool chaining and sub-blocks really

486
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:10,000
like take the idea of a stateless or ultra
light client that you can, get that type

487
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:15,000
of snappy UX is huge for the ecosystem.

488
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:22,000
I probably you read this. This year we go
for number one or shut your website down

489
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:27,000
and don't frustrate people. I think
there's

490
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:33,000
I think there's an element of truth to
that, right? Where, I don't know, that's

491
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:38,000
one of the messy things about crypto is
it's like you have to know all of these

492
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:43,000
websites and bounce all over the place,
versus having like these, the potential to

493
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:48,000
have micro clients that can just, interact
with contracts on chain. even the idea of

494
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:53,000
like a one click install node is huge.
versus, where we started, I was what, had

495
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:58,000
to make sure I had all the dependencies
and, run a jar.

496
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Yep.

497
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:08,000
So, we've come a long way, but I think we
still have a huge green area in front of

498
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:13,000
us in terms of like the layer one UX. And
I do think that, C8 is right. That that's

499
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:18,000
like the optimal outcome.

500
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Yeah. All right, we've got PGR four,
five, six from signature set. I'll kick

501
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:28,000
in. But with Keystone integration, looking
forward to get my hands on a Keystone

502
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:33,000
device. Former mostly done apart from some
bug fixing, testing, awaiting review by

503
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Keystone team after holidays. Rust SDK
done and awaiting review. JavaScript-based

504
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:43,000
SDK done and awaiting review, remaining
WebUSB SDK, integration into wallet

505
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:48,000
software, Nautilus, Satergo, et cetera.

506
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:59,000
That's going to be fun. What's it called?
I prefer this over... My desk is messy. I

507
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:06,000
lost my ledger key. It's somewhere here,
Joe.

508
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:11,000
I prefer this to this, honestly, just UX
wise. You know what I mean?

509
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,000
I have big fingers. I don't like Ledger's
little. Oh, gosh. You're like, I've never

510
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,000
liked those little fiddly bugs.

511
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Every time we do a, every time we do a. a
Rosen Bridge for GARD transaction man it's

512
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:30,000
like you're clicking like 30 times boom
boom except boom because you have to you

513
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:36,000
have to prove every single box that's
across so it's it's fiddly little fucking

514
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:42,000
things I don't like honestly.

515
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:49,000
You got Celaut right there with the
Celaut project. Writing ideas about the

516
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:54,000
service payment system, implementing a
service classification feature for a new

517
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:59,000
demo. Beene, which I'm going to assume is
going to be like Italian good. Finalizing

518
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:04,000
the UI fixes for the first version. From
there, we'll continue adding improvements

519
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:09,000
for the second version. Awesome.

520
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Oh, and let's see. saying we should call
and talk about Ergo development and tools.

521
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Awesome.

522
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:24,000
All right, we are Mark the Shark. Also,
he's been pumping away Mark's been pumping

523
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:29,000
crazy man. He's got his own like shark
theming. He's got like no shark eyes boxes

524
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:34,000
like bots going crazy in the channel. It's
it's amazing. I'm babysitting the he's on

525
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:39,000
break right now for the weekend. So he
asked me to babysit the mining server. So

526
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:44,000
I've been popping in and out of there
checking that out.

527
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,000
But yeah, so he's got miner rights
protocol, token flight, automated system

528
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:50,000
that emits a token to miners with a
corresponding rights token, integrated

529
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,000
pool and protocol feed to mimic an actual
proof of work emission. This could help

530
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,000
bring the concept of hard slash sound
money to native tokens. IgniFox tokens

531
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,000
were distributed to the miners of the pool
a month ago or so. But if miners want to

532
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,000
participate and don't have this token,
reach out and he'll send you one. Note,

533
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,000
this is only a prototype. No plans to do
anything with these tokens after testing

534
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,000
is done.

535
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:19,000
For further testing for the Hashmon
project, we will be creating another token

536
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:23,000
to test using NFTs as a rights token. Like
we'll be using the NFTs we have already

537
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:27,000
minted. They'll happy to mint another NFT
to distribute to current set of miners.

538
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Containerizing code bases for automated
airdrops based on specific use cases, i.e.

539
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:35,000
bonus tokens and demurrage distribution
for Sigmanauts' mining pool. Note MRP is

540
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:39,000
already automated at the time of writing.
If you want to check out the code, feel

541
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:43,000
free to do so here. He's got his git
there. Note current MRP code is not in the

542
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:47,000
main branch yet.

543
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Sigmanauts' mining pool deployed MRP
token flight as mentioned above. Miners

544
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:01,000
receiving the token Flame Shards if they
hold the IgniFox token and mine to the

545
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:05,000
pool when the pool finds a block. This is
fun stuff. The hope is to use this tool to

546
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:09,000
create more revenue for miners outside of
ERG itself. Mining pool received 2 million

547
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:13,000
RSV this from disco Solaris team and began
distributing these tokens as of this past

548
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:17,000
Monday. Again, mining is an amazing way to
token launch. Folks, even if you already

549
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:21,000
launched, it's an amazing way to
distribute these kinds of things.

550
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Especially, especially looking at like, I
don't know, pump fun is a great example.

551
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:33,000
No, well, think about it. It's like the
largest incentive there is to have supply

552
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:38,000
dominance. You have supply dominance and
help something happens versus if you have

553
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:43,000
like proof of work, emission, you can
create a contract, admit it through time

554
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:48,000
to where its ability to come to market,
and be distributed is. Especially with

555
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:53,000
these these extra tokens, right? Because
miners are what miners are paying this

556
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:58,000
they have to pay their bills.

557
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:05,000
That's understood, right? There are
miners who speculate too, but if you give

558
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:10,000
a miner enough funds to pay their bill and
something extra, they have to pay their

559
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:15,000
bills. They're going to use it as a
speculative token to see if it's going to

560
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:20,000
rise in the future. And it's going to be
either a slower dump, but it's definitely

561
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:25,000
going to be a slower distribution. And
they're actually working for it, too.

562
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:30,000
They're actually converting electricity to
secure the chain. It's a great way to do

563
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:35,000
it.

564
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Yeah, so the Marp software running on the
pool has been causing our disk space to

565
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,000
rise quickly and causes some down it
caused a few minutes of downtime to the

566
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,000
pool reached out to qx() about this and
working a fix. He works also mentioned

567
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,000
some other solutions which we're exploring
as well. I can't remember what I

568
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,000
mentioned. I forgot already.

569
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Created the NurseShark monitoring bot for
pool-related TXs and notifications. I also

570
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:02,000
have integrated it with Anthropic's LLMs,
so as to query the LLM for wallet-related

571
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:07,000
activity. Not yet released on Git, looking
at integrating an open-source LLM so we

572
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:12,000
don't have to have users pay for their
queries. Amazing.

573
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Hashmon not to be redundant, but
prototyping the MRP token flight with the

574
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:23,000
IgniFox and Flame Shards This tool will be
used to distribute our evolution shards

575
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:28,000
for this project, which will be used to
evolve monsters. I swear Mark the Shark

576
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:33,000
was like a world-class Dungeon Master in
his past right guy seems to have grown up

577
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:38,000
with these several facets and levels of
complexity to make these things fun

578
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Protocol fields will be collected into
the wallet and initially thinking that the

579
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:49,000
first person who collects them all will
get the keys to this wallet. Oh, nice.

580
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Need to finalize tokenomics with C8.
Looking to launch project end of February,

581
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:59,000
beginning of March. Example of using the
LLM for my grid trading bot. He's got,

582
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:04,000
what's he got there? Miner, it's protocol
token. He's got the shark bot right there.

583
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,000
And he continues thresher a reinforcement
learning agent project what aims is to

584
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,000
trade it to trade on DEXes created a
script to scrape the DEX wallet to use as

585
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,000
a training data for the RL training
environment. Agent environment works as

586
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,000
expected, but more work needs to be done
and have the agent learn effectively and

587
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,000
trade.

588
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Some sort of interesting. Agents,
actions, buy, sell, hold, rebalance, agent

589
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:31,000
approvations, various buy and sells of ERG
and given native token, parallel

590
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:35,000
optimization runs on GPU, so to train
agents fast. Again, more works need to be

591
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:39,000
done on the reward environment, likely
another month or two work to be done so it

592
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:43,000
can effectively trade. Need to integrate
hyper parameter tuning so we can optimize

593
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:47,000
the various parameters We can change like
planning rate and real world structure if

594
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:51,000
you haven't noticed mark works with LLM's
for his fiat job So this guy's got the

595
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:55,000
chops to do this kind of stuff.

596
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:02,000
You could actually do some neat stuff I
know he's a he's a python guy and in terms

597
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:07,000
of work so I imagine if he can get some
LLM's and build some API's that are

598
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:12,000
getting fed information and build out some
more if statements, he could potentially

599
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:17,000
build something pretty cool with trading.
I think that's it for the update.

600
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Yeah, I think that's all we got.

601
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
I'm going to end with something.

602
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Wait, don't end yet. Don't end yet, Joe.
Don't end yet. We got, it's been a while

603
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:30,000
since we've done a DevOps, so I think it's
fair to remind people that I always try to

604
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:34,000
put Cyberverse into. They've been kicking
butt. They jump from average night of 40

605
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:38,000
users up to about 100. I think that a high
watermark in the high hundreds, and now

606
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:42,000
they're averaging 90, 100 users at any
given time. They just brought in a new

607
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:46,000
game that's archery. That's really cool.
You get one shot with an arrow. The

608
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:50,000
balloons go up. So you have to kind of
time it when you're shooting with other

609
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:54,000
people. Really cool mini game.

610
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Just keep hitting a pixel and the team
here. They just keep kicking out of the

611
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:08,000
park. It's amazing. Another people that
keep kicking out of the part are Echo and

612
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:13,000
HQx with MewMart MewFinance the dudes are
like writing stuff like they post

613
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:18,000
something that they just wrote I go to bed
I come up in the morning and they've done

614
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:23,000
something else like Amazing like
fundraising LP buy-ins token launches

615
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:30,000
all that kind of stuff. He's looking into
getting Keystone wallets to sell on

616
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:35,000
MewMart as well so you can buy without KYC
or giving up your address to some

617
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:40,000
corporate overlords and get spammed for
the rest of time. So two projects that are

618
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:45,000
amazing. Hopefully they'll do an update
next week to catch us on the dev update.

619
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:50,000
But they are both fantastic. All right,
sorry, go for it. What's your ending, Joe?

620
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:56,000
My closing message is this. When I was in
the when I was in the Ergo Foundation, I

621
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:02,000
had to take like a position of neutrality
when it comes to mining pools. Right.

622
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:08,000
Because I had to I had to, ping them and
say, hey, we updated or no. Now I no

623
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:14,000
longer have to. So until until Mark's pool
is the leading pool in terms of hash rate,

624
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:20,000
if you're mining Ergo, what the fuck are
you doing pointing to any other pool?

625
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:27,000
I know it's crazy. You have a chance. You
have a chance to be part of a DAO, right?

626
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:32,000
You have a chance to run the damn pool
with everybody else. It's like.

627
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:38,000
No, I mean, there are people out there
that probably just set their rigs, but,

628
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:43,000
really stop this. I'm no longer neutral
because I no longer need to be until their

629
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:48,000
hash rate dominant mine to them. Because
the other pools are not contributing to

630
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:53,000
the ecosystem in any way. other than
they're making their rewards and earning

631
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:58,000
some money. And I guess periodically
they'll market something, this or that.

632
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:03,000
But until the active ecosystem is
dominant, don't waste your energy feeding

633
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:08,000
it into people that really don't care.

634
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:14,000
So miners out there, please consider
mining to community pools because they're

635
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:20,000
active and they bring value, they build
things for Ergo. They're not just a

636
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:26,000
service. And, the bottom line is we need
to put these services in a position where

637
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:32,000
they actually need to do something to
compete. So take that as you will.

638
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:36,000
I'm gonna leave it at that Joe. That's a
great place to leave it. Some good sound

639
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:40,000
bites for Mark to everybody. It's good to
be back with the dev updates, Joe. I

640
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:44,000
appreciate you hopping on the first time
back.

641
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Have a good one.

642
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Thanks everybody. Bye bye.
