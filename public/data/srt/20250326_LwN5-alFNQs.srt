00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Welcome to the live Ergo developer update
with me tonight.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I have the amazing, the elusive, the very
busy Joseph Armeanio.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
How are you doing, John?

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I'm doing all right. Busy week.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
What is it today? Tuesday?

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
You know, I've lost track, honestly.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Feels a little deeper in the week than
Tuesday, but that's how life goes

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
sometimes.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It does. I like to say what a week it's
been today.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
You say that on Monday. That's half my
life usually.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Let me stick the link in chat so people
can join us. There we go. Live link is in

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
chat.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
All right, guys, we're live with the Ergo
update. Joe managed to find some colored

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
beverage in his closet.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I am also cheersing to Ergo and its
success.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
And we're going to bring you all the news
of the ecosystem from last week and maybe

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
some bullshit along the way. We'll see.
Joe, what do you want to talk about

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
tonight?

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I don't know. I haven't been paying that
much attention to be honest with the

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
latest bullshit in the crypto space.
There's always something going on.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Well, I think we got some more official
pumping of the Trump token from Trump's

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
truth social account. I saw that this
week.

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I don't know where to start with that
stuff, Joe. When are the people that are

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
using blockchain for its intended purpose
going to outnumber the people that are

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
just using it to get rich quick or steal
money from other people? When's that going

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
to happen, Joe?

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:00,000
It's hard to say. I think we're going to
see a split in the crypto space at some

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:08,000
point, right? Because if you look at
what's trending in popular at this point,

29
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:16,000
it's institutional adoption, using stable
coins to absorb treasuries, creating the

30
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:24,000
regulatory beginning of stable coins.

31
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I think that generally once something is
under the purview of regulators that tends

32
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
to move more in a ratchet, like one
direction, rather than it starts and then

33
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
that's it forever, right?

34
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:48,000
So I think we're probably gonna see some
kind of public-private partnership digital

35
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:56,000
money that may not have the greatest
assumptions in terms of surveillance.

36
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
We're gonna see a lot of that stuff,
yeah.

37
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
The ability to seize it. With stable
coins more, we're probably going to be

38
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
moving in the direction where there's just
a lot more financial surveillance that's

39
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
possible on public blockchain.

40
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
And then the question is, how do we get
to privacy? Right? Because that's

41
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
something that I think in some sense, the
market will demand it, right? And that's

42
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
kind of an open question.

43
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
We have this idea of confidentiality
where you're kind of trusting someone

44
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
won't reveal your information rather than
true privacy assumption, which is where

45
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
you're trusting the cryptography that's
actually concealing your information.

46
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It's interesting. From my personal
perspective, and it could be wrong and I

47
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:59,000
hope I'm wrong, is that generally in the
Western consciousness, you have a public

48
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:06,000
private partnership and you have powers on
the back end and people can invest in the

49
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:13,000
prison that they live in. They're happy.

50
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Because then you have the profit
incentive, right? We've seen this already

51
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:31,000
with a lot of - you can look at Gmail, you
could look at Facebook, you can look at a

52
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:40,000
lot of these public private partnerships
that have in the back end that end up

53
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:49,000
giving way too much data information that
doesn't really benefit users other than

54
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:58,000
the user experience of it, which even then
is somewhat hard to argue.

55
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I think there's always an equal opposite
polarity, right? It's like thermodynamics

56
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
when it comes to energy and probably also
culture too. Where if we do see more

57
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
institutional adoption and we do see more
surveillance and tracking compliance based

58
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
tooling that's forced on people, I do
think that that is the best narrative

59
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
privacy projects and resilient neutral
money has ever seen.

60
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
So mainstream blockchain adoption, right?
I think we're gonna - I think it's so vast

61
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
and so different. DJ, if you have a
question, pop it in there. No problem.

62
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It's so vast and different that it's going
to be such a myriad of things out there. I

63
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
think we're going to see a ton of
centralization, a ton of controlled

64
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
assets. As you said, that you can mock
down and you don't really have control of

65
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,000
it.

66
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
But we're going to see blockchain
adoption to where you don't even have an

67
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
idea that the blockchain is happening in
the background. Like you're interacting

68
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
with something and boom like I was
thinking the other day like with all these

69
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
AI fakes out there, right? And you can't
trust videos or pictures anymore. If Joe's

70
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
gonna publish a video, what better way to
signify that Joe is the owner of that

71
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
video and actually publish it by putting
the checksum of the video in a transaction

72
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
on chain signed with Joe's wallet then we
know right off the bat that it's Joe's

73
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
kind of thing. So those kind of things can
be in the background people won't even

74
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
know that it's a case, but it's easily
look up, and it's resilient cause it's on

75
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
tons of different nodes and that kind of
thing to the point where we also have peer

76
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
to peer finance institutions where you
have the bank of Joe, the bank of QX and

77
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
all that kind of stuff.

78
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I don't think it's going to be one thing
and that's it. We have to be ready for the

79
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
fact that peer to peer be a big chunk, but
it might be an outlier as well at some

80
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
point.

81
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Yeah, to some degree, I think we need to
take a step back and realize what is a

82
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:12,000
blockchain? It's a ledger. From a close-up
perspective, it's a ledger that's just

83
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:22,000
replicated around the world, hopefully.

84
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
If you have a single signer ledger, I
don't know why blockchain is really the

85
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
way. A lot of the best properties of
something like Bitcoin itself had to do

86
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
with the fact that it's distributed enough
that it's kind of unstoppable, right?

87
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
That's really where I started to gain
interest in this space is this idea of

88
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,000
saying, if we can create neutral money and
it's the system out there that anybody

89
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
with an internet connection can
potentially connect with or interact with,

90
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
you just remove so many barriers of trade
and commerce and expression and exchange

91
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
between people.

92
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
And so when you get into it's a
centralized system, I don't see why it's

93
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
even worth mentioning to be honest. I
mean, there are other database structures

94
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,000
that are probably more performant, right?

95
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Yeah. And that plays into the part where
I don't think the centralized - I don't

96
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
think at least a peer to peer
decentralized - let's take the US, right.

97
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
And some of the major players, right. I
think that's going to be an obvious

98
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
adoption of centralized structures that
they have control over. I don't think that

99
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
peer-to-peer decentralized networks are
going to be widely embraced by governments

100
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
per se, right? They're built for the
individual so that they're on the same

101
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
footing as the person with insider
information or the person with more money

102
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
or that kind of thing.

103
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
So I think we'll see that kind of
peer-to-peer adoption on a broader scale

104
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
across the world as opposed to let's hope
that the U.S. government picks up Ergo or

105
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
something. It's not going to happen,
right?

106
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Yeah, I think it's interesting to see how
any type of internet technology can

107
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,000
potentially remove boundaries, right?
We're in a Discord channel or a Telegram

108
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
or Signal and we're talking to kind of a
global audience in a frictionless way.

109
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,000
We're communicating, exchanging ideas.

110
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
And so this idea where if you do have
these internet protocols, you can open

111
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
markets, which is powerful, right? I think
that's ultimately the main interesting use

112
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
case for stable coins in a way, is you
have this ability to expand the dollar's

113
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
reach into a cross border environment
without having to deal with exchange

114
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
markets, right? You use Internet
technology to bypass a lot of the physical

115
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,000
infrastructure that you'd normally have to
deal with.

116
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:08,000
And so we probably will see a lot of
adoption of dollars we already have with

117
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:15,000
USDT. That's one of its more interesting
aspects has always been these local money

118
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:22,000
exchanges that will kind of create their
own conversion and kind of ramp people to

119
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:29,000
the dollar or dollar exposure and
circumvent whatever system they're in. So

120
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I do think there's value there. It's just
a question of data availability for the

121
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:43,000
user and control functions in the backend
that I'm just not a fan of.

122
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Yeah, I can see tiered blockchain ledger
tiers essentially with centralized

123
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
blockchains will only expose this part of
the transaction or the chain to you at

124
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
this tier or always ways to sell the data
that you're collecting. Absolutely crazy.

125
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,000
But you're talking about stable, right? I
briefly read an article that things like

126
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
gold, silver are becoming more attractive,
stable options, as opposed to the US

127
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,000
dollar, right?

128
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Well, I think that many people have
called the dollar the cleanest dirty shirt

129
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:27,000
in terms of currencies. There's a lot of
debt backing the dollar. We're in a weird

130
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:33,000
position in a lot of different ways with
humanity. It's just honest. The debt

131
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:39,000
burden globally is huge. We've gone
through this rapid acceleration of

132
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:45,000
technology to where we went through the
mechanical age and then the electronic age

133
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:51,000
and then the internet age. Now we're
entering into the machine mind age.

134
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Yep. Absolutely crazy. We're live at this
time. It's like somebody's great

135
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
grandfather had an outhouse in the field,
right?

136
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Yeah, exactly.

137
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Now we're moving into the age of
artificial intelligence emerging and all

138
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
kinds of - you can synthesize a dead
parent's voice, like I can synthesize my

139
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
mother's voice and feed her all the emails
she's ever sent me ever and then have a

140
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
chat with her. It's insane. Absolutely.

141
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,000
So I mean, technology is accelerating.
Social consciousness hasn't really caught

142
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,000
up with where the edge of that is - it's
kind of a wake effect where it takes a

143
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,000
while to bleed through to the masses but
the tip of the spear there is moving

144
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
faster and faster and faster.

145
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:52,000
So it's going to be disruptive, right? I
would say that when you look at technology

146
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:58,000
as it develops, it's a force multiplier.
And so we are moving again through

147
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:04,000
probably a decade of disruption where
everybody that has a shovel is going to

148
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:10,000
get displaced by somebody that has a
backhoe. And I think people have a certain

149
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:16,000
awareness of that, in my opinion.

150
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Yeah, it'll be interesting. How do we get
to a point where people start? I mean,

151
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:34,000
American stuff, right. In America, you sit
back and you say, I don't agree with this

152
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:43,000
administration, but I'm not going to do
anything about it. So you have this kind

153
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:52,000
of - I'll just focus on me and my local
network. And I'll be good to the people

154
00:13:52,000 --> 00:14:01,000
that are in my local network.

155
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Yeah, that's true. Local networks
important, but I'm thinking about not just

156
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,000
the US outside of the US at one point. At
one point, if the knowledge is given,

157
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,000
these people start saying, you know what,
I'm going to take control of my own

158
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,000
assets, my own ability to make sure that
somebody's not screwing me over. These

159
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,000
tooling that can guarantee kind of a
predictable manner in how it's being

160
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,000
executed, right?

161
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
At what point does an average person that
is being affected, like Joe, we got it

162
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
easy, right? I mean, we got it really
easy, right? We have jobs, we have house,

163
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
we have those kinds of things. So we can
go to the bank, get a loan, we can take

164
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
money out of the bank, but that's not the
majority of the world, right? So my

165
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
question is, how do we - I guess it's a
slow burn, right? Eventually it's a slow

166
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
burn. How do we get that information in
the people's hands that it really does

167
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
matter for their livelihood about these
kinds of changes that'll make a big

168
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
difference in their lives?

169
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I tend to think that the best way to do
something like that is teach by example.

170
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,000
If you're talking about more mature
financial tools, the crypto space is a bit

171
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,000
immature. We have to be honest.

172
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I'm going to have to edit that one out,
Joe.

173
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Oh, yeah, shoot. We're live.

174
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Sorry. No. I mean, listen, a lot of the
times if somebody that's not familiar with

175
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,000
crypto asked me what I do, I say I try to
work with open source financial software.

176
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Versus crypto. And then it's an
interesting conversation. Well, what is

177
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,000
that? I say, well, it's this ability to
see and understand the system that you

178
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,000
interact with.

179
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
How do you argue against that? That
doesn't - that's got to sound attractive

180
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
to almost anybody.

181
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Yeah. Then people are genuinely
interested because it's like, well, I've

182
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
never thought that - I go to the bank and
I have no idea what their balance sheet is

183
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
or no idea who's holding the mortgage to
my house because it's been auctioned off X

184
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
amount of times or titles.

185
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Your student loans go through like 10
different fricking people.

186
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,000
If you get into this idea of having
different assumptions in the system, the

187
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,000
financial system, people are interested in
that, right? Because many people are,

188
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,000
they've either thought about it and it's
kind of a wild thing or they haven't

189
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,000
thought about it. You pay off your house.
Who owns the title to your house? Yeah, it

190
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,000
usually gets passed packaged and passed
around. Who owns the title to your car?

191
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Who owns your student loan?

192
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:59,000
The type of inability to see into our
financial system is fascinating, yet the

193
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:05,000
mirror is put on the user where they're
constantly wanting to know who are you,

194
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:11,000
how much do you have and where did it come
from. Which in some sense is a very weird

195
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:17,000
relationship.

196
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,000
If I just met you and I'm saying, hey,
QX, can you look after my money? And

197
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,000
you're saying, well, who are you? And
where'd you get this? And me as the person

198
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,000
who actually has the money that's handing
it to you, what do I get in terms of

199
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:38,000
transparency from that side? It's
interesting.

200
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,000
It's so normal that nobody questions it,
but there's a lot of things in this world

201
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,000
that are so normal that nobody really
questions it. And I think that money is

202
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,000
one of the things that when you really
start to question what's happening in

203
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:00,000
terms of the system itself, it's a deep
and weird hole.

204
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,000
It is. And you're talking about are the
money makers that made me think like on

205
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,000
chain, right? I can - even the layman
essentially can see a transaction in your

206
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,000
wallet and see where it's going, see what
it's like. They might want to be able to

207
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,000
read a smart contract, but at least they
can go to GitHub in just the whole thing

208
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,000
into an AI and maybe ask it what it's
doing so they may have an idea when you

209
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,000
sign off for a mortgage like - you sign,
you're not reading those 800 pages that

210
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,000
you're signing, right? You have no clue,
just kind of the general ideas of what's

211
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,000
happening with that paper that you're
signing.

212
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,000
One of the more interesting aspects of
learning machine models really is this

213
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:54,000
idea of being able to digest large amounts
of information and spit something out to

214
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,000
the user like something is off here.
Right? Because it takes a lot of time and

215
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:04,000
energy to dive through that. Can you hear
the dog?

216
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I love it. It's fine. It's a good
background. Guys, don't worry about it,

217
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Joe.

218
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
All right. There's probably like an eight
foot bear out back trying to swat him or

219
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
something.

220
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Yeah, I know.

221
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,000
All right, let's see. We got a question
here really quick. Karim says, Spectrum

222
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Finance needs to come back strong. You
know, I get it, but they don't necessarily

223
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,000
need to. We've got all the contracts
online. We've got the that are open

224
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,000
source. We've got the UI that's open
source. Anybody can pick it up and start

225
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:44,000
cranking out more features. MewFinance did
it. They took the front end and did a ton

226
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,000
of optimization tweaks to it and using the
smart contracts for the pools. So anybody

227
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,000
can do it. That's the beauty of it. I
don't think - we gotta try to stop

228
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,000
creating idols, right? We gotta stop
creating like, oh, this is a thing that's

229
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,000
gonna save us or that kind of thing.

230
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Yeah, I think that's the better option is
just ideate and push for ideas. Yeah,

231
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
there are some interesting options for
decentralized exchange that haven't been

232
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
explored on Ergo. It'd be really cool to
see.

233
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Joe, I'm just waiting for you to build a
DEX into Rosen Bridge.

234
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:25,000
To build a DEX into Rosen Bridge? Well, I
think it's better to build around Rosen

235
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Bridge. And the reason why is because you
have a system that doesn't rehypothecate

236
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:37,000
assets, holds collateral one-to-one. And
when you start to seek yield or swaps

237
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:43,000
internally, you create a much messier
situation in terms of being able to audit

238
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:49,000
the fact that there's no rehypothecation.

239
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:55,000
So you could get into cross-chain swaps,
it's doable, but it's not necessarily

240
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:01,000
changing the protocol of the bridge
itself. I think sometimes there's a way to

241
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:07,000
make Rosen faster that's relatively
straightforward, basically.

242
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Right. Rosen fastening.

243
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Right. What you would do is you would
require a premium fee on the person that's

244
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,000
bridging, and you would use the bridge
protocol in the background, and you would

245
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:26,000
simply have liquidity providers that front
an element of weaker assumptions, release

246
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,000
funds, and then get paid as the original
transaction goes through.

247
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Yeah, you want fast pay a premium, right?

248
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
That's kind of how the banking system
works, right? You can send something

249
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
faster and add a little bit of -

250
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Speaking of speaking of Rosen and
Fastlane and that kind of stuff, I was

251
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,000
speaking to - I was helping out a guy
who's spinning up a watcher on Aragore, I

252
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,000
believe, first, and he's looking at
Cardano. And he is one of his questions

253
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
was - Do you, can I use the same
collateral? The 30,000 Rosen and the 800

254
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
ERG. Can I use the same collateral for
Cardano and Ergo? And I was like, no, I

255
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
said it's a completely separate set of
collateral. You have to actually run a

256
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,000
separate watcher. You can't just put both
in the same file. And that sounds like a

257
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
bummer to the person running it.

258
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
But that's the beauty of ROSIN is that
you're forcing a distributed method, even

259
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
if I'm the same person running three
watchers, right? I'm running it on

260
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
probably three different computers. Yeah,
I'm running it on three different

261
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
computers on two different networks. So
you're forcing kind of this distribution,

262
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
right? Of course, some people are going to
run onto the same machine. But still, the

263
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
smart thing is, I'm going to run my
watches on three different machines

264
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,000
because I have them. Because if one
machine goes down, I don't lose out on all

265
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,000
three profits, I only lose out on one
profit until I fix it. And then the other

266
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
two machines are still picking up profits
for the chains that I'm on. So with that

267
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
model that you're doing, you're kind of
forcing this spread out decentralization,

268
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
even among individuals who are doing more
than one watcher set. So I think it's a

269
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,000
brilliant idea that you're requiring
liquidity for both staking liquidity for

270
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,000
both for any chain that you go on for each
watcher, essentially.

271
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:23,000
So that was just an economic friction to
create.

272
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Yep.

273
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
That's why it's there.

274
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Awesome. All right, we've got another
question. Dejan wants to know if Ergo is

275
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:36,000
kushti's main thing or he's got a side
hustle. Also, same question for

276
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:42,000
developers. Where is money coming from to
finance Ergo development? Good question.

277
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Oh, that's a good question. Let's see,
I've worked with kushti for quite a while.

278
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I don't think he's actually been paid by
anybody since about 2021.

279
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I know, I don't think so.

280
00:23:53,000 --> 00:24:00,000
So it's a question of saying, why? Why
would somebody put years of their life

281
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:07,000
into building something that is subject to
hyper volatility and is subject to people

282
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:14,000
that are constantly aggressive and people
that are constantly quite pushy? And you

283
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:21,000
have no direct financial incentive to do
that in terms of salary. It's because he,

284
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:28,000
number one, he enjoys developing.

285
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,000
What gets him excited is to read research
papers and think, what is possible? But

286
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,000
actually, the thing that probably
interests him the most is kind of the idea

287
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,000
of free banking. And I think that just
comes from his perspective of the world,

288
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,000
seeing kind of the state of the world,
seeing technology, seeing what's

289
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
potentially possible and how that could
benefit and change systems and improve

290
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,000
people's lives. A lot of crazy shit
happens on planet Earth because of our

291
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,000
money systems.

292
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Greed, money, yep.

293
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Yeah, well, I mean, it's like the ability
to print money is the ability to fund

294
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:16,000
wars. You usually have hyper
centralization and Cantillon effects and

295
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:22,000
the downstream effects of that warp.

296
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Not just like, you have the power, you
have the money printing, look at the US

297
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:32,000
right now, right? They're prolific money
printers, we are. And not only that, but

298
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,000
we have the power to actually hurt other
economies, right? So we can not only print

299
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:42,000
our own money, but we can then hurt other
economies strategically during that

300
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:47,000
process, to even bolster a dollar even
more. So it's frickin insane.

301
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:56,000
I mean, it's a tool of power and control.
It's a weird system, right? So I guess

302
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:03,000
from some high level, the question is if
you can change the emission consensus

303
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:10,000
around money and you can change the
distribution mechanics around money. And

304
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:17,000
you can build systems that are more
transparent. That also offer the potential

305
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:24,000
to be more private, that also offer all of
these - I think that as systems advance, a

306
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:31,000
lot of exotic financial instruments that
were at one point only reserved for the

307
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:38,000
select few will become common. And then
things will get interesting, right?

308
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:45,000
So, yeah, I don't know. I think his
motivation is just simply based on where

309
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:51,000
his passion is and where his understanding
of how technology could potentially change

310
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:57,000
things. One of the things that tends to
get Alex the most excited is the idea of

311
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:03,000
free banking, which is in a way very, very
different than the layer one blockchain

312
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:09,000
attitude, right?

313
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,000
The commercial attitude. Yeah, yeah,
yeah, 100%. And it doesn't take much to

314
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:22,000
learn that about kushti, right? Read his
forum post, check him out on Twitter. And

315
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:27,000
it's very - It's very apparent early on
that if that's his attitude and that's his

316
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:32,000
core principle of supporting that kind of
self sovereignty of your own right.

317
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,000
There's a lot of people that don't want
to touch the money systems in the world.

318
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,000
They want to enhance it. And we're seeing
that with stable coin adoption. Well, I

319
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,000
think the funnier thing to do is touch the
money. Touch the money, change the system.

320
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,000
And crypto has kind of gone full circle to
where we started. It's kind of like fuck

321
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,000
the central banks. And now it's literally
let them power the central banks and take

322
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,000
bonds and mint dollars, which is a wild
turn of events. But I don't know.

323
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Different time, different era, I guess.

324
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Yeah, my second part of that question is
where is money coming from to finance Ergo

325
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:20,000
development? And that's a great answer on
that. It speaks to the resiliency of Ergo,

326
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:26,000
right? There's money coming from all
right. So there's money from the EF for

327
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:32,000
bounties, right? And then there's project
money, right? There's those projects that

328
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:38,000
have posted or have started projects and
gotten support funding. Look at Palmyra.

329
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Look at Crux Finance. Look at MewFinance.
Look at all those kind of things on Ergo

330
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:50,000
so far. But the crux of the matter is that
the idea is that - And that makes us

331
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:56,000
resilient, right? Is there's no funding to
dry up. kushti's developing as he is.

332
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
I said we're poor.

333
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:04,000
So people are developing because they
believe in the cause of there should be

334
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:09,000
some fair system that's out there for
anybody to use. Right. And you can't dry

335
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:14,000
that up. Right. That's a cause that people
are willing to pick up and fight for.

336
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:20,000
So I think it simply goes to this idea of
adding value to a system. If you add value

337
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:25,000
to a system, you enhance it, right? And so
a lot of the developers that I know that

338
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:30,000
work on Ergo, they're adding value to the
system to enhance the value of the system.

339
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,000
That's why they develop.

340
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Right, and that's the beauty of Ergo,
right? Because the Ergo community and Ergo

341
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,000
itself, that's literally on the Ergo
Manifesto about what its purpose is for.

342
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
So go to another chain such as Ethereum.
You'll be drowned out, right? You start

343
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,000
speaking like this. Well, let's make a
fair mining. Well, let's say back when

344
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Ethereum was proof of work, right? You do
a fair mining initiative where you have

345
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,000
something like Lithos with distributed
miners collectively coming together,

346
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,000
right? That possibly could be drowned out
because that's not of interest to people

347
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,000
trying to make buck or make millions of
dollars off that kind of thing. So on

348
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Ergo, it's the interesting value of the
chain is that we're building for something

349
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,000
better, right?

350
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Yeah, that's the goal. Of course, there
are people in there that want to double or

351
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,000
triple or 10 times or 100 times their
investment on that. OK, you deserve it.

352
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Actually, if you're investing in a project
like Ergo early on, sure, whatever. You

353
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
deserve that kind of thing. But I'd say
the meat of the people that are here in

354
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Ergo, the developers that are working on
it are working on it for that cause.

355
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Right. They're here for a reason because
they believe in what Ergo is and what it

356
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,000
represents. They believe in the mission
statement. And that's why they're here, I

357
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,000
think. So these bull markets, these bear
markets, it doesn't matter. There's always

358
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,000
somebody that believes in Ergo that's
still building and continuing really cool

359
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
stuff.

360
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:09,000
That's where Bitcoin came from, in a way.
There was no direct funding sources from

361
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:14,000
the chain. It was just proof of work. And
you can look at Litecoin, proof of work.

362
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:19,000
That's changed a lot, right? The incentive
structure in crypto has gotten a lot

363
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:24,000
different over time. Or I would say just
things are way more centralized. But yeah,

364
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:29,000
I think that if you're going to raise
funds, I've always been an advocate for

365
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:34,000
build a product that's public facing and
open source. Right. And which is

366
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:39,000
interesting because that's probably
backwards for how most people fundraise

367
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:44,000
today.

368
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,000
No, you know, I said that to the
blockchain group that I speak that I gave

369
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,000
a lecture to. I said, the scary thing
about open source is that anybody can take

370
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,000
your stuff and spin it up and try it
themselves. I said so. So the issue, the

371
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,000
challenge that our developers face, the
community developers on Ergo when they

372
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,000
open source their projects are that they
now need to think that, code's all open

373
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,000
source, anybody can take out of the spin.
So I need to come up with some unique

374
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,000
property that makes me better than anybody
else that would be trying to run my code,

375
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,000
right? And that could be customer service,
that could be the interface that they're

376
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,000
pumping from. So it opens up a whole new
world of competition with this open source

377
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,000
stuff that doesn't exist with closed
source stuff, right? It's absolutely

378
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
amazing to watch.

379
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
I tend to think of that from a totally
different angle.

380
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
All right, let's see.

381
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,000
So if somebody rebuilds a Rosen bridge,
that's better. And it leads to more

382
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,000
adoption. Fuck yeah, do it.

383
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,000
You may lose half your team to that new
company, right?

384
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Fuck it.

385
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:00,000
It's a matter of progress. I don't know,
look at Bitcoin or any type of science -

386
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:06,000
you build on the shoulders of those before
you. That is progress. That is how

387
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:12,000
progress is made. So if I come up with an
open source idea that I pursue and it's

388
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:18,000
retooled in a way that is better, that's
awesome, right? Because what am I trying

389
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:24,000
to get rid of - Rosen is trying to disrupt
middlemen, right? If we can get around the

390
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:30,000
friction of that in terms of listing
access and access to liquidity, amazing,

391
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:36,000
do it.

392
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:49,000
If we look at Lithos. If we look at
Lithos, it's a matter of putting the best

393
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:56,000
assumptions to miners, right? If somebody
else can do that, I think that the idea

394
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:03,000
itself is beneficial because of what it
provides. So if somebody can rebuild it in

395
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:10,000
a way that's better, I'm happy.

396
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Right. That's scary. And I agree that
that's one point of it, right? That's one

397
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,000
way to look at it. But it's tough to
attract a lot of develop. You got to be

398
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:25,000
kind of a developer with big balls, I
guess. And I hate to see I hate to use big

399
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:29,000
balls. Elon Musk has ruined the big balls
thing.

400
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Give me one second.

401
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Yeah, I'll keep talking. So I feel it's
tough to you have to get a really strong

402
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:44,000
developer that's really confident with
those kind of things and recognize that I

403
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:49,000
need to kick ass and Oh, hey, puppy. Hey,
buddy, that's a puppy. with little needle

404
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:54,000
teeth. I really need to kick butt and give
something that somebody else isn't going

405
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:59,000
to give if I want to stay ahead of the
curve. And that drives progress for both

406
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:04,000
sides, right? So I think it's great in
that matter.

407
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Let's see, what else? What else are there
questions? Is this guy going to bite you?

408
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Well, what a cutie, what a cutie.

409
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Let's see. Any other questions? Smart AI
Learning says currently AI can generate

410
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:24,000
and play 3D games within a model as seen
in Google projects. If AI generated mining

411
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,000
becomes possible, how might it impact
other algorithms? I don't think there - I

412
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:34,000
mean, mining is still going to create,
still going to be requiring of power,

413
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:39,000
right? You're still going to need
something to actually compute the problem

414
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:44,000
that the blockchain is presenting you
with. So I'm not sure what you're asking

415
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:49,000
that Smart AI, but perhaps you're speaking
about generated mining. That doesn't make

416
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:54,000
sense to me.

417
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
I have no idea.

418
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Yeah, so as far as mining goes, there's
no way around solving the problem, right?

419
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Even if you use AI to try to solve the
problem, you're still using a crap ton of

420
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:16,000
video cards to do it, right? So the power
consumption might equal out the same

421
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:21,000
there, if that's what you're asking for.
If you're asking for other things about if

422
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:26,000
AI or quantum computers essentially can
figure out that kind of thing, well,

423
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Ergo's kind of got that figured out
already in that Joe's idea on sigma chains

424
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:36,000
or side chains can create quantum
resistant chains that you can move your

425
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:41,000
store value over to, to protect it. Things
like that can always be made. Ergo can

426
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:46,000
kind of stay on the head of the curve like
that. So that's what I love about Ergo

427
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:51,000
too, Joe, is that the ability to pivot is
freaking insane with a project like Ergo,

428
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:56,000
right? When you have open source, you can
always tweak it, always modify it, you can

429
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:01,000
always extend it. So it gives you a lot of
flexibility.

430
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Yeah, I see the same thing at our
college. We have - we're one of the

431
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,000
smaller colleges inside Cornell
University, the architecture department.

432
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,000
And I will say to my counterparts, they're
like, what are you doing? And what are you

433
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,000
doing? I'm like, I just spun this up the
other day. And I threw it at the students.

434
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,000
They're like, What? And I'm like, Yeah,
who cares? This is a cool thing that we're

435
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,000
trying to do. And the students can test it
out for us. They like it. They like it. If

436
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,000
they don't, they don't. And people in
bigger entities just can't do that, and

437
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,000
especially when things are closed source.
So yeah, I think Ergo really champions at

438
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,000
that where they have the ability to just
pivot on a dime. kushti can say hey, let's

439
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,000
try to think of this or a community dev
can come on and do that. But yeah, that's

440
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,000
what I love about Ergo the ability to
pivot on a freaking time about that kind

441
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,000
of stuff. Your dog's adorable Joe.

442
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:04,000
I look at it as a success, honestly, that
there's not a lot of demand for a token

443
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:11,000
launch platform. Now, you may say, there's
not many projects starting in Ergo, blah,

444
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:18,000
blah, blah. That's why it's not needed.
The way I look at it is that there's so

445
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:25,000
much tooling involved in Ergo with
airdrops tools, with token distribution

446
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:32,000
tools. Sigma Lock should be coming out any
time now. We're waiting for kushti when he

447
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:39,000
gets a free second to review the
contracts. That's all. There's so many

448
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:46,000
things and toolings on Ergo that things
like Bulbar, things like GreasyCex, things

449
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:53,000
like - What else? All these other projects
can launch and do token distribution

450
00:38:53,000 --> 00:39:00,000
without even using a platform like that.

451
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:23,000
So I see that as not only, hey, it sucks
that Ergopad can't sustain their model on

452
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Ergo, but the decks are kind of stacked
against them with that kind of open source

453
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:53,000
tooling that anybody can use and jump
onto. Did you send your puppy away, Joe?

454
00:39:53,000 --> 00:40:01,000
You have little Ergo bird things for your
puppies.

455
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Oh, Joe hit the wrong button.

456
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:12,000
All right. Let's see. We can jump into
the... Let's see if he's still here,

457
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:18,000
actually. What did he mute? One moment.
There's he just muted his video. That's

458
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:24,000
all. No biggie. He's probably spanking his
puppies.

459
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:29,000
All right. So back to let's see if we
have any questions we can answer while

460
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:34,000
he's gone.

461
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
New world disorder says you can't change
the world, but you can change your world.

462
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Yeah, exactly.

463
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
You can change your network, too.

464
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Right, right. That was back when we were
talking about outside of the US

465
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:50,000
recognizing that these toolings are great
for them. Yeah, I agree. Yeah. I mean, the

466
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:55,000
centralized systems are louder, much
louder much more appealing to people but I

467
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:00,000
think slowly by slowly we'll get more and
more people over to the side of where you

468
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:05,000
feel like there's a benefit to being in
control of your own bank of your own

469
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:10,000
resources. Yeah I think we're in the
infancy stages of it that's for sure that

470
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:15,000
is for sure I think we're pretty early in
what these protocols will be capable of.

471
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Did you beat your dog Joe? No just
outside.

472
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,000
You got a bone you can throw him?

473
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Yeah, just throw a ball.

474
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:33,000
So I used to live in. Before I live in
town here where I am now, I used to live

475
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:38,000
in the in the boonies. We had 35 acres,
not much the Colorado standards, Joe, but

476
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:43,000
it was pretty good for New York standards.
So we have 35 acres and our dogs used to

477
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:48,000
love to run outside, right? You just let
him outside it, whatever time they'd come

478
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:53,000
back when they were ready kind of thing.
But those puppies would bring back like

479
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:58,000
deer ribs or like a whole leg of a deer.
Your dogs do that to you. Sometimes it's

480
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:03,000
just a huge bone in the yard. You're like,
okay, where the hell did that come from?

481
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:08,000
That happens. And you get the dewormer
out, then you get the shots out.

482
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:14,000
All right. Mark the shark. Mark the
shark, everybody. Mark the shark's got a

483
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:20,000
question, but Mark the shark is in Florida
right now. He's going to the Mining

484
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Disrupt Conference. He's going to spread
the glory of GPU mining and peer-to-peer

485
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:32,000
networks. So that's going to be - Awesome
that Mark's there. We've never been to

486
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:38,000
district before, it's mainly a Bitcoin
focused I imagine Joe right Bitcoin

487
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:44,000
probably So, it's gonna be nice to have
him there putting the GPU mining in

488
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:50,000
people's ears the word of Ergo and all
that kind of stuff.

489
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Don't worry about your dog Joe. We can
hear you. It's no big deal. Just shake it

490
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:00,000
off. Really don't worry about it.

491
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Alright, Mark the shark says with
sub-blocks could make a tool to compete

492
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:09,000
with Zelle - seems it runs similar to a
blockchain. Zelle is what Zelle's a cash

493
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,000
transaction app, right? Transferring money
to each other peer to peer, right? That's

494
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:17,000
so that's what I feel the attractiveness
of sub-blocks will be, right? One thing

495
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:21,000
people need to remember is that finality
is key, right? Finality is the security

496
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:25,000
that dApp providers and central exchanges
are going to rely on. So whether if Ergo

497
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:29,000
settles in two minutes and they say 10
blocks is what we trust that is not going

498
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:33,000
to be rolled back on the chain. I don't
think it's ever been a rollback on Ergo,

499
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,000
but whatever. Sub-blocks doesn't really
change that from a dApp or a central

500
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:41,000
exchange point of view, right? Because as
kushti said, these are kind of weak

501
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:45,000
blocks, right? So they're still going to
want some sort of confirmation in there

502
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:49,000
that gives them the finality and the trust
that they can say, yeah, OK, you've

503
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:53,000
transferred us $10,000. Go ahead and take
it out of your bank.

504
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:10,000
What sub-blocks is going to be a boon for
is for peer-to-peer transactions, right?

505
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:15,000
It's going to allow me to transfer ones to
Joe within a few seconds, then hop off

506
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:20,000
that with chain transactions, all of that
kind of thing. So yes, Mark's totally

507
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:25,000
right. Mark, that sub-blocks will be a
great addition for these kind of really

508
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:30,000
fast peer-to-peer transactions that you
can kind of have a soft finality for. So

509
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:35,000
yeah, looking forward to that.

510
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:41,000
I think kushti just released RC3 for
Mining Testnet. I'm still on RC2 for

511
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Mining Testnet. So there's no real need to
upgrade. But yeah, excited to see the

512
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:53,000
progress on that.

513
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Your dog's all right, Joe. Joe, it's like
babysitting three-year-olds. You're

514
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:03,000
babysitting your nieces, your nephews,
dogs. It might be easier with

515
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:08,000
three-year-olds, Joe. I'd tell you, they'd
be asleep by now, I think.

516
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:16,000
No, there's a lot of potential
applications that that opens up. The big

517
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:22,000
question is just going to be the
assumptions of settlement, right?

518
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Exactly. Yep. So I think, yeah, honestly,
I think it's going to be a big plus to

519
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:32,000
peer to peer kind of things. You walk up
to a friend, you send them money, boom,

520
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:37,000
it's done. It's there with sub-blocks. You
want to withdraw $30,000 from exchange.

521
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:42,000
You send $30,000 worth of ERGs to the
exchange. Yeah. They're going to probably

522
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:47,000
still wait for 10, 20 main blocks for that
kind of transaction to finalize. So don't

523
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:52,000
think that that's going to make it any
faster there, but yeah.

524
00:45:54,000 --> 00:46:03,000
What else, Joe?

525
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:07,000
I don't know. Any other questions?

526
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:12,000
My sister got me this candle for a white
elephant gift at Christmas. I haven't

527
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:17,000
burnt it yet. No other questions. We can
keep going. Let's talk about, why don't we

528
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:22,000
talk about the dev updates and then we can
come back to shooting the shit if we get

529
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:27,000
there and we're still awake. Sound good?

530
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,000
All right. Let's see. I'm going to hit
the dev update button. It's going to

531
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,000
switch scenes. Oh, beautiful. Perfect. All
right. Do you have the dev update in front

532
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,000
of you, Joe?

533
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:45,000
All right. Perfect. The first one, this
is from 319. This is an NBR with Nautilus.

534
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:51,000
They released version 1.1.0. And since we
haven't done an update yet, since 1.0,

535
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:57,000
everybody should make sure to upgrade to
1.0. Absolutely beautiful, very beautiful

536
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:03,000
wallet for the Chrome plugin extension.
Takes dark mode. It looks fantastic. Love

537
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:09,000
it. So he released version 1.10, polished
SigmaUSD dApp implementation, fixed a

538
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:15,000
ledger connection bug, fixed Firefox
compatibility issues. Added semi-automatic

539
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:21,000
release CI, which has built the different
targets and release happens in the CI

540
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:27,000
workflow. Publishing in stores is done
manually after functional and security

541
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:33,000
tests. Minor UI tweaks. Next up, add
internationalization support. That's a big

542
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:39,000
word to save for three cups of peach
schnapps.

543
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:47,000
All right. Looks like next we have
kushti. He's been working on the Ergo

544
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:53,000
protocol and reference client doing some
research and development. With Scripto

545
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:59,000
3.1.0, with Scala 3 support released,
along with new version for Scorix, Utils,

546
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:05,000
and D-Box. So Josnia has been on that for
PRs working towards that end. So that'd be

547
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:11,000
nice to see Scala 3. Ergo 6.0.0 RC3 has
been released. A couple of fixed PRs for

548
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:17,000
6.0 has merged into the 6.0 branch. He's
working on polishing to propose for

549
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:23,000
review. So everybody out there, please
take a look. It looks like polishing 6.0.0

550
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:29,000
PR for the node. It's a proposal for
review as well. For sub-blocks, Forks

551
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:35,000
resolution is done and covered with tests,
planning the peer-to-peer layer for

552
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:41,000
sub-blocks propagation. So that's another
step.

553
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:48,000
And also, people who are running nodes,
please, if you're starting up a new node,

554
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:54,000
don't take 6.0, right? Drop down. Those
are pre-releases. It's not going to work

555
00:48:54,000 --> 00:49:00,000
on the normal node. You have to drop down
to 5.2.1 or whatever the latest 5 is kind

556
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:06,000
of thing. So make sure you do that. And
also FYI, our community note update. The

557
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:12,000
RocksDB database loves SSDs. Man, that
thing is fast, Joe.

558
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:17,000
For some reason, my node on my
aero.aep.cornell.edu explorer just chunked

559
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:22,000
out. It toasted. I can't remember why.
It's been too long. So I had to rebuild it

560
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:27,000
from scratch and I use the latest RocksDB
and holy cow. Nothing is fast. If I go to

561
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:32,000
my SigmaUSD oracle wallet, you know,
usually on the old node that took about 15

562
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:37,000
seconds 20 seconds to load that things
loaded in five seconds, because that thing

563
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:42,000
has like 30 40 50 thousand transactions
from SigmaUSD oracle but yeah RocksDB if

564
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:47,000
anybody has the time to and they want to
redo it to RocksDB. It loves SSDs super

565
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:52,000
fast. It's fantastic.

566
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:01,000
All right, let's see what else we have.
kushti says, ChainCash. He's got a paper

567
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:06,000
out. It's done. Will appear on preprint
server shortly. Awesome. I'm really

568
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:11,000
excited for ChainCash. ChainCash is like
the thing that, no, it feels like - It

569
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:16,000
feels like we're taking power away from
the government with this kind of thing. If

570
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:21,000
it goes on, if people actually use it and
use it for what it's made, it means that

571
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:26,000
entities and groups can actually mint
notes based on their reserves and people

572
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:31,000
can pass them out and actually use them as
forms of payment for things that represent

573
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:36,000
the reserve. Like, how cool is that? How
cool is that for an entity to be able to

574
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:41,000
mint their own currency? Right. That's
flipping awesome. And you may say, well,

575
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:46,000
why don't they just mint a token and sell
their token and that kind of thing? This

576
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:51,000
is totally different. This is literally a
note that is backed up by a reserve from a

577
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:56,000
treasury of an entity that does it or
backed up by anything else. It could be

578
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:01,000
backed up by physical goods at some point,
depending if they can figure out a best

579
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:06,000
way to rationalize that on chain. But
yeah, super cool, super excited for

580
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:11,000
ChainCash. That's going to be really cool.

581
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Joe, your dogs are fine. Don't stress
out, buddy. All right, what else we got?

582
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:30,000
I'll go with Dexy since it's still
kushti. Dexy, he says deployed UI for

583
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Testnet. They've got the XYZ link right
there for Ergo-Fi. Please give it a try.

584
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:42,000
On Sigma Rust, Python binding is done by
disk and pushed to PyPI. PyPI. I've

585
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:48,000
reviewed and approved another couple of
6.0 PRS by do sec. Great. It looks like

586
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:54,000
you got Kobe Selardoor.

587
00:51:55,000 --> 00:52:02,000
All right. So it looks good to be back.
Good to have you back. Kobe. The Ergo node

588
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:09,000
open API fixed, issue 2199. It's worked on
open CI issue 2202, with sigma state

589
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:16,000
getting to know the Merkle trees for sigma
script. Like he reviewed one of Joe's next

590
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:23,000
PR node reviews for sigma state and
script.

591
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Oh, all right. Let's see what else we
have.

592
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Oh, holy cow, Joe, we've got a Paideia
update from Luivatra. I need a sip of

593
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:43,000
peach schnapps after this.

594
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:48,000
All right, Luivatra, we got Paideia fix
an issue, breaking display of token amount

595
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:53,000
for some tokens and send funds proposals
resulted in and. Man tracking down a bug

596
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:58,000
that happens around start of new staking
cycle, causing the stake to be corrupted.

597
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:03,000
A reset of the off chain bot fixes this,
but not ideal. So trying to make permanent

598
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:08,000
fix. If anybody has Paideia sitting on the
wallet, please, please join the General's

599
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:13,000
Paideia DAO, right? Stake that Paideia,
get more Paideia and participate in voting

600
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:18,000
on changes on the overall Paideia DAO. So
you're missing an opportunity there if

601
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:23,000
you're sitting on Paideia in your wallet
or the crux. Added better error handling

602
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:28,000
on some of the endpoints inspired by
tokens being minted with funky registers.

603
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:33,000
I wonder what Luivatra's funky definition
is.

604
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
All right, you got Joseph Mice there.

605
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:45,000
All right. All in Beene. I've been
putting the final touches to finally close

606
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:51,000
the first version. I've done a great job
to significantly improve the front end.

607
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Once we have everything tied up, we'll
proceed to implement support for other

608
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:03,000
tokens besides the ERG. With Celaut.

609
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:14,000
I'm still working on refining and
maturing what I have to take confidence

610
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:22,000
steps forward, although I'm happy with how
things are going.

611
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Joe, I think we need some meme coins with
your dogs. I think we need some dog meme

612
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:36,000
coins.

613
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Do your dogs ever sleep, Joe? Do your
dogs ever sleep?

614
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:58,000
All right, what else we have here? Let's
see. Anything else?

615
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:06,000
We've got some debugging going on, some
cross help here. Issues requested for

616
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Sigma Rust. We're going to contribute to
it and they're prepping for the developer

617
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:22,000
chat tomorrow. Yeah. Cool, that's it for
that chat there. You switch back to our

618
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:30,000
double window here. OK, we're switched
back.

619
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Let's see what else we have for question
here we have. No more questions we have.

620
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Would be sick to see a Stripe type app for
Natalie to plug into this AI-generated

621
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:49,000
games, Mark says. By the way, Mark's
developed, for those of you who don't

622
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:55,000
know, Mark's fine-tuned a LLM to, what did
he do? He fine-tuned an LLM to respond

623
00:55:55,000 --> 00:56:01,000
back with node queries or something like
that. I've had too much peach schnapps to

624
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:07,000
really center on exactly what he did. It's
been too long, but something like that. So

625
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Mark does LLM tuning in his IRL life, in
real life life stuff. So he's really

626
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:19,000
diving into that for Ergo.

627
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:23,000
For those who don't know, Mark runs the
Sigmanauts mining pool. If you guys are

628
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:27,000
mining and you're mining to anything other
than the Sigmanauts pool, consider

629
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:31,000
pointing to the Sigmanauts pool because
there's bonus tokens that are there. We

630
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:35,000
also are the only pool that collects
storage rent. So there's a lot of extra

631
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:39,000
ERGs in there that come out each week as
well as bonus tokens. And there's a really

632
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:43,000
we're on Telegram, big chat in there,
super fun to hang out there and chat. So

633
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:47,000
there's no reason why you shouldn't join
the Sigmanauts pool there as my plug for

634
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:51,000
the Sigmanauts pool.

635
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
What did you do with your dogs? Did you
strangle them, Joe?

636
00:56:55,000 --> 00:57:00,000
No, I put the puppy in the box. It's got
the little cage, the quiet box, the wire

637
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:05,000
box.

638
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Oh, that's funny. It doesn't try to bite
the wire.

639
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:12,000
No, no, no. It's just like a state of
depression.

640
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:17,000
It's like crap. I screwed up.

641
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Yeah, probably should have started there,
to be honest.

642
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:24,000
No, it was cute hearing your pups, Joe.
All right, what else? Anything else to

643
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:28,000
chat about? It's 11:05. I'm sure my wife's
in bed, so it doesn't matter what time I

644
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:32,000
go to bed at this point.

645
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:38,000
What's new for Rosen Joe? What's on the
roadmap after Doge?

646
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Oh, after Doge. I definitely like to get
more focused on the Nervos bridge. I think

647
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:50,000
that if we're going to talk about EVM
environments, there's definitely the

648
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:56,000
possibility to go to something like base
or ink, get into the exchange sphere, just

649
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:02,000
because there's liquidity there. If we're
talking Bitcoin forks, probably Bitcoin

650
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Cash. It's a big community and I don't
know, generally is a little bit more, I

651
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:14,000
would say aligned with UTXO. That's some
good development happening there through

652
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:20,000
time. So let's see.

653
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:27,000
All right. I know there's some, when the
Sigmanauts was an ask to use some EF funds

654
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:33,000
to help bolster, there was the Binance
pool. Or the I think it was PancakeSwap. I

655
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:39,000
think it was a Binance pull on Pancake or
something like that. So I think that I

656
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:45,000
think the EF was like, yeah, we'll put up
for a vote and it probably will pass. So

657
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:51,000
expect to possibly see some more liquidity
in that pool. So that's super sweet.

658
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Oh, Byron asks when the US Ergo meetup
Joe, you've got a building.

659
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:00,000
I have a place in Colorado Springs. If
the community ever wants to have a U.S.

660
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:04,000
meetup. Yeah, I've got keys to.

661
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
That's pretty central, too. I think
that's a good spot for it.

662
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Yeah, I've got keys to a place in
Colorado Springs.

663
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:12,000
We have like a we got to have activity
lists of like an Ergo hike where we hike

664
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:15,000
to the summit of some mountain.

665
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:20,000
And I mean, it depends on the time of
year. There's always stuff to do around

666
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:25,000
Colorado, but it's pretty much downtown,
downtown. So it's a good spot.

667
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:29,000
All right. I wonder how many people get
out there.

668
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:32,000
I don't know. I've always said I have
keys. I don't really want to do anything

669
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:35,000
more than that. And I think that's a
pretty good contribution. So community

670
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:38,000
gets building.

671
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
You figure it out.

672
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Yeah, exactly. I mean, yeah, I got a
pretty busy life. I can't really I don't

673
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:50,000
have the bandwidth for that, but I do have
a place. So if people want to make that

674
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:54,000
happen, we could definitely do it.

675
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Maybe we should talk about it more in the
next couple of weeks or months to try to

676
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
get more people interested.

677
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:05,000
I've done my part.

678
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:09,000
You've done your part. You've offered
Joe. Yeah, perfect. Well, what else do you

679
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:13,000
have on the back burner besides Rosen?
Anything else kicking around?

680
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Working through the rollup contracts, a
lot of potential edge cases to be aware

681
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:22,000
of. So that's something just go slow, do
it right. And everything will go kind of

682
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:26,000
downhill from that point in terms of
coast. It's like the hardest part of

683
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Lithos, probably the humming.

684
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:37,000
I think we can get qx() to come out to
Colorado.

685
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:43,000
I don't know, maybe if you ask him.

686
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:47,000
So talk more about Lithos. What step are
you at? I saw an update the other day.

687
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:54,000
At this point, basically refactoring the
rollup contracts. At that point,

688
01:00:54,000 --> 01:01:01,000
everything from there is kind of downhill.
It's just like, let's tweak it. Let's see

689
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:08,000
how it performs. Play around with the LETS
token. So we'll actually have kind of a

690
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:15,000
public test net after this next milestone,
which would be real cool to see.

691
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:19,000
And there's no, this is not, you know
how, well, let's take Rosen for example,

692
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:22,000
right? Everything's written back to the
Ergo chain, right? Lithos. So if another

693
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:25,000
chain wants to adopt it, there's no write
back to Ergo chain for any of the

694
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:28,000
settlements, right? It'll be purely on
their chain if they rewrite it for their

695
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:31,000
chain.

696
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:42,000
Yeah, we have the potential to take
Lithos across Bitcoin, just proof of work

697
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:49,000
in general. So it is designed to be pretty
modular.

698
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:53,000
So for those people watching that aren't
familiar with Lithos, in short, it's an

699
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:57,000
ability to kind of solo mine but still
pool mine based on chain. So you don't

700
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:01,000
have to join something like Herominers, a
single mining pool. You're essentially

701
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:05,000
solo mining, but still collectively you
can join a decentralized pool,

702
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:09,000
essentially.

703
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:18,000
Yeah, you'll be able to join kind of a
special type of mining pool that will

704
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:24,000
allow you as the miner to build blocks and
you'll still have the potential to get

705
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:30,000
shares. It's just how that's calculated
and done is not a secret.

706
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
Awesome. Awesome.

707
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:36,000
I think somebody's happy. I put the puppy
in the box.

708
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:41,000
I think that's a thing. A big thank you.
What's this one's name?

709
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
This is Bella.

710
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:51,000
Oh, Bella. Italian. Very nice. What kind
of dog?

711
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
Shepherd mix, I guess.

712
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:56,000
Oh, very nice. Would she be able to take
your no, your child could take everybody,

713
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:59,000
right? There's no question about that.

714
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,000
No, she and the shower friends.

715
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:06,000
Oh, that's sweet. That's very sweet. Do
they does your child sleep on your bed

716
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:09,000
with you?

717
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:13,000
No, usually close up in front of the
doors to the house.

718
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
Really like guard dog?

719
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
Yeah, he's that's kind of their nature.

720
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
That's amazing.

721
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Yeah, so he's got the house on lock 24/7.

722
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:29,000
All right, I think let's see how long
we've been going on for we've been going

723
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:34,000
for oh an hour and four minutes Joe And
rusting just said good night. So if

724
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:39,000
rusting says good night, and we don't have
anything else to talk about let me finish

725
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:44,000
this up here

726
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:52,000
All right, everybody, thank you for
coming. Sorry if the dogs were crazy. I'm

727
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:57,000
watching an 18-month-old puppy, and it's
kind of half velociraptor and half

728
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:02,000
crackhead. So I'm doing my best.
Productivity has declined for the last

729
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:07,000
day, but I can eat it.

730
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:10,000
I got to make it back to the liquor shelf
to put this away, and then got to stumble

731
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:13,000
upstairs. I don't know if I'll make it. My
wife might find me on the landing in the

732
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:16,000
morning, Joe.

733
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
Well, Taylor, I said I'm sorry.

734
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:25,000
Thanks, everybody, for watching. It's fun
to do these live Dev updates. We'll do

735
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:30,000
them as often as we can get Joe to
function at this hour.

736
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
All right. Have a good one, everybody.

737
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:35,000
Ciao.
