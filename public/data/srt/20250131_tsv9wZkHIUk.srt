1
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Hey everyone, how's it going?

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Hello, welcome everybody.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Hi kushti, how you doing?

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Doing well, how about you?

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I'm hanging in there, still nursing off
whatever I had a couple weeks ago, but

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
maybe someday it'll get rid of it.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Crazy. So it's lasted this long.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
You managed to not get sick this winter?

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Sorry?

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
You managed to keep from getting sick
this winter, kushti?

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, so still, yeah. I'm
totally fine. And yeah, I even have a lot

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
of power during the winter.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
So how's about your Sigmanauts power?

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Sigmanauts power.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:03,000
It's been slow burn this semester, I
guess, this start of the quarter. I've

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,000
been doing a lot of focusing outside of
that on my Cornell stuff.

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
What's today? Today's Thursday? So we
didn't have the show. Yeah, so we had the

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
show last week and I got some good ideas
on how to help that BRICK economy get

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
going.

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
And the idea was that people were seeing
our show and they're like, hey, why does

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
this blockchain recycling have to stop
after the show is over? And I was like,

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
well, it doesn't. I said we could set this
up upstairs in our IT place.

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
And then another idea came that what
could facilitate more value pointed

24
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
towards BRICKs, Cornell BRICK. And the
idea is, okay, we can blend the two.

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
So instead of students throwing out their
massive amounts of paper after they're

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
done critiquing, you know, we're talking
four or five huge, like 42 by 60 inch

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
print outs, we can have a large bin in our
area and every time a student brings one

28
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
of those plots to recycle after they're
done with it, we can hand them off like

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
ten BRICK or five BRICK or fifteen BRICK.

30
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
So this will not only encourage students
to bring their plots back and actually

31
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
recycle them instead of throwing them in
the garbage or letting them fall on the

32
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
floor and the custodial staff takes care
of them in the garbage. But it'll also put

33
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
an even bigger system of value in place
for the BRICK in that it's a reward token

34
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
for recycling your plot.

35
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
which you can then use after probably,
we're thinking maybe every six or seven

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
plots recycled, you'll generate enough
BRICK to print another plot for free. So

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
there's incentive for kids to actually
recycle them and get that BRICK in turn

38
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
for value to then put it back into the
system and plot with it.

39
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
So that's our next step in doing that.
I've been thoroughly testing my system set

40
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
up and it's been running well for me
printing from it with blockchain payments.

41
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
So that part's ready to go.

42
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
So once we get that bin set up, we'll
start that and get going. It's going to be

43
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
interesting. A lot of kids are excited. So
we'll see.

44
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Yeah. That's actually quite amazing. So I
thought actually, well, I've been thinking

45
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:31,000
actually, well, for many years about, you
know, creating monetary systems where

46
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:39,000
money created, you know, when people,
well, recycling wastes, you know, doing,

47
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:47,000
well, positive things like trees planting,
reforestation, stuff like that.

48
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Yeah, and well, it could be more useful
than those carbon credits, right? Yeah,

49
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,000
there are two tokens, so carbon credits
and there is also debit token, I believe,

50
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,000
carbon credits.

51
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:13,000
From what I know about that system, it's
usually not about carbon at all in the

52
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:21,000
real world. Usually those credits are
being used to cover many holes different

53
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:29,000
agencies like UN agencies have.

54
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:39,000
In general, from what I know, that system
is not working well. It's possible to

55
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:49,000
design high belief systems in bottom-up
fashion, which will work better. Well, a

56
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:59,000
way to emit new money, right, when
students are bringing plots to be reused.

57
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
So, yeah, it's quite exciting, actually,
experiment.

58
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Exactly. Try to create some sort of local
incentive that really has a direct effect

59
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
on the students and I mean honestly these
students may somewhat care about recycling

60
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
but you know they don't have time for it
it's not at the top of their mind but if

61
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
you provide some sort of incentive
directly to them where the effort is low

62
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
too they simply have to just walk 50 feet
over to our office and dump a plot in a

63
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
bin and then we tip them the BRICK, I
mean, that's going to be some very simple

64
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
incentive to do this kind of stuff.

65
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,000
So yeah, super excited about that. We'll
see how they respond to that. My guess is,

66
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,000
you know, Cornell is like many Ivy
schools, there's a lot of cash tuition

67
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,000
students, I imagine. So you'll have a mix
of students who just don't give a crap.

68
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,000
And then you'll have a mix of students who
will be like, you don't care? Give me your

69
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,000
plot. I'll recycle it for you. And they
take the BRICK out of it.

70
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
So I think you'll see a lot of that. So
you'll get this active cleanup of people

71
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
who want free plots walking around the 350
student studio and being like, hey, are

72
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
you done with that? Can I recycle that?
You know, that kind of thing. So it'll be

73
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
an interesting economy there.

74
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'm really interested to see how it's
going to play out. And then they were also

75
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
talking about yeah, what if I leave or
what if I no longer have to do plots this

76
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
semester or, you know, what if there's no
value in the token that's valuable to me?

77
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
And then the kids were like, oh, you
know, I'll give you, you give me your

78
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
tokens and I'll buy you some coffee or
I'll buy you lunch at the restaurant

79
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
downstairs or that kind of thing. So those
are neat swaps that could be happening

80
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
too.

81
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Yeah, that's quite amazing. Comparing
with other ways to emit new money we have

82
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,000
in the crypto space. For example,
airdrops. Usually airdrops is when you're

83
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:04,000
just rewarding people for creating
accounts, right?

84
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
And social media wealth and you are
basically basically incentivizing spam,

85
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
right? So creating spam accounts and
Facebook, social media to get more airdrop

86
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
tokens.

87
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,000
But here you have some real and positive
way, right? And while it's still based on

88
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:32,000
a trusted party like an airdrop, but yeah,
at least you know, well, distribution has

89
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:38,000
some antecedent mechanism and you also
will bring in a positive impact in return,

90
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,000
right, like waste recycling.

91
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
That's actually quite awesome. And have
you announced the community chats we will

92
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,000
have?

93
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
No, let me do that today. Why don't you
announce it in person right here and then

94
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
we'll announce it on Twitter later.

95
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Yeah, but so what's the time? Is it 3 or
4 p.m.? I propose both times. Let's pick

96
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:14,000
one.

97
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
That's UTC proposed?

98
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Yeah, yeah, so 4 p.m. UTC maybe.

99
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Yeah, that's beautiful. Yeah, that works.

100
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:29,000
All right, so next Tuesday will be
February 4th. Yeah, so let's meet our

101
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:36,000
community town hall and discuss different
well, monetary innovation aspects we have

102
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:43,000
in the Ergo Core protocol and the
ecosystem.

103
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:49,000
And, well, not just dApps, but maybe
things like BRICKs would be good to get

104
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:55,000
more insights on that actually. But yeah,
we will also discuss storage rent for

105
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:01,000
sure, then algorithmic monetary policies,
well, emission reduction and possible

106
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:07,000
effects, right?

107
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:19,000
So if we are talking about the native
cryptocurrency, then yeah, we can discuss

108
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:28,000
custom emission contracts, FIMO, miners
rights protocol. So all those things.

109
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,000
We can talk a little bit about the
storage rent too. Let's bring that to the

110
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,000
front of the picture too. Cause I think as
of now, it's still just Sigmanauts pool

111
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
doing it and a few independent devs doing
some sniping as well So it'd be nice to

112
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
get that word spread out more I'll try to
maybe I'll invite the DX pool guys have

113
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,000
them announce it in their channel as well
as others

114
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Recently, Sigmanauts collected some good
amounts of ERGs, like 14 ERGs.

115
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I didn't see that one, but yeah, there's
been times where we've had two or three

116
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
ERGs in one shot in the storage rent pool.
It's pretty impressive. Five, I think, was

117
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
the one that I noticed a couple of weeks
ago.

118
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Yeah, super cool, super impressive that
that happens. I don't think people

119
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,000
realize. Because we're on the Ergo how
amazing that is but if you get somebody on

120
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,000
another chain I bet, well that's tough too
because Bitcoin maxis are like, oh, it's

121
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
great that coins are lost, right? They're
like that's beneficial to the system So it

122
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
is a little tough sell to those guys, but
I think it's amazing

123
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Yeah, but yeah, well, there are some
heated talks in the Bitcoin community as

124
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:59,000
well, right? So it would be good to get
Bitcoiners joining discussions as well.

125
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Yeah, so some good tokens got storage
rented recently as well. I've seen that

126
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:13,000
one of the earliest Ergo Lore series NFTs
got collected and then burned something

127
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:20,000
like that.

128
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:27,000
So there was some interesting story. I
don't know, maybe accidentally burnt. So,

129
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:33,000
well, that's also interesting question,
right? So what are the burning practices

130
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:39,000
in storage rent? And yeah, actually, it's
quite interesting because, well, every

131
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:45,000
party which is collecting so Sigmanauts of
those individual snipers so that they can

132
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:51,000
use different strategies, right? That's
quite funny.

133
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
So briefly, chat on that, kushti. So
there was an early conception, an early

134
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
idea that miners were the only ones that
were allowed to recreate boxes, right? But

135
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
you had mentioned in an AMA at one point
that that's not entirely true at this

136
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
point anymore.

137
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
And now anybody can try to include the
transaction in a block. It's up to the

138
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
miners to include it or not, but anybody
can take any of the storage rent if they

139
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
get their transaction picked up in the
block. Is that true?

140
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Oh, it's actually how it was designed
since day one, right? So, well, no need to

141
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:37,000
log to minerspubkey or whatever. Well,
miners always can reshuffle transactions,

142
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:44,000
right? So, well, if some sniper dev is
collecting storage rent. So, supposedly,

143
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:51,000
if miners are not lazy, they will just
throw away such transactions from the

144
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:58,000
block, right, and replace with own storage
rent.

145
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:04,000
It's in some theory, right, where miners
are well behaving rationally, right, so

146
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:10,000
maximizing their profits. And what we have
in practice, some miners are well a little

147
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:16,000
bit weird, right, mostly. So they're not
maximizing their profits even, which is

148
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:22,000
quite counterintuitive.

149
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Right, right. So this storage rent was
kind of designed in mind that, yeah, once

150
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
it was able to be active, you'll get the
pools to pick it up. But we're kind of in

151
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
a limbo state right now where not all the
pools are picking it up yet.

152
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,000
And devs have the ability, or anybody
that can write that code has the ability

153
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,000
to snipe themselves the storage rent if
they want to. In an ideal scenario, and I

154
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,000
imagine how you designed it, was that once
every pool is on storage rent, the dev

155
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,000
snipers don't matter because the mining
pools will just replace those sniper TXs

156
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,000
with their own TXs to claim storage rent
in the blocks they find.

157
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Right. And well, eventually we will get
to that stage, right?

158
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Interesting transition stage, though.

159
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Yeah, so when emission would be low, like
three ERGs per block, right, so there will

160
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:21,000
be a lot of incentive, right, to collect
storage rent. So not to be lazy about

161
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:27,000
additional source of income.

162
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
But speaking of storage rent.

163
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Did you just say transaction?

164
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Yeah, but you also said it's lazy. You
didn't say transaction. You said

165
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:42,000
transaction. What's a transaction QX?

166
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,000
That's a new term. It's a quantum based
transaction.

167
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Yeah, no no kushti didn't say you said
it.

168
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Oh, I said it. I can't speak I've got
like a pound of like whatever in my face I

169
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
can't speak at all.

170
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I got a pound of New York.

171
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Yeah, I got a pound of New York Well
speaking of storage rent kushti there's

172
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
$20,000 worth of liquidity in the ERG/PHP
token that was picked up by storage rent

173
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
the first Big big pull for the whole PHP
token so 20 grand of liquidity. I think

174
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
that's pretty damn amazing.

175
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:26,000
All right, so wait, so basically 20k USD
worth of value are now because of, well,

176
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:37,000
basically digital waste recycling, right?

177
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Yeah, exactly, exactly.

178
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:48,000
That's quite fine. I mean, that's the
whole new dimension in the understanding

179
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:56,000
of blockchain economic protocols maybe,
right? So when you can get new value from

180
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:04,000
recycling digital waste basically on the
blockchain. That's very funny actually.

181
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I mean, it's a narrative, right? Only on
the Ergo. Really cool.

182
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Yeah, so, well, actually, it's quite
strange even, right? So, well, Ergo was

183
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,000
launched back in 2019 and still it's the
only blockchain with storage rent, right?

184
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,000
well, generic sigma protocols language,
right? So, the ability to create

185
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,000
cryptographic protocols as applications,
right? Variety of cryptographic protocols

186
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,000
and so on.

187
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:44,000
So, yeah, well, it's even strange that no
one is copying that, but maybe because the

188
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:51,000
time is a bit different now, it's not 2015
anymore, so people are just, well, those

189
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:58,000
days are doing somewhat, I don't know, new
BFT protocols and then trying to will

190
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:05,000
present them as proof of stake like I
don't know Cardano's you know proof of

191
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:12,000
stake so like no normal proof of stake but
yeah actually it's just BFT under the hood

192
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:19,000
so well more centralized consensus
protocol obviously and then yeah they just

193
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:26,000
have EVM on top of so well it's now about
like 100 chains which are pretty

194
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:33,000
indistinguishable to me.

195
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:45,000
So what's varying there is a set of
venture capital funds backing those

196
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:55,000
protocols. That's the most differentiating
part usually those days.

197
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Talking about miners, Dan, how are
lithium miners doing? Different kind of

198
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:10,000
miners. Any news from your side, from
real-world mining?

199
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Our partners, the ones that we're
building the lithium index with, one of

200
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:28,000
them is actually, I guess, in whatever
it's called, well, the circle, so the

201
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:37,000
circle to be picked as the mining
secretary for Argentina.

202
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,000
So just like with all appointments,
there's several leading candidates, and

203
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,000
then one of them gets appointed. So he's a
leading candidate to get appointed to the

204
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:54,000
mining secretary of Argentina. So we're
definitely going to be into mining big

205
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,000
time.

206
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Yeah. And so, yeah, we're actually
connecting with other lithium pricing

207
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:13,000
source providers because we're trying to
build out an Oracle network to supply all

208
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:19,000
these different prices for the lithium
index. So, yeah, we're making connections

209
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:25,000
to other mining organizations and
companies and widening out our network.

210
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:36,000
So yeah, we're quite a lot of mining
happening in a literal sense. And yeah,

211
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:44,000
and actually, I was telling QX that our
Biz Dev lead in Buenos Aires is... My

212
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Argentinian friends keep telling me how to
say it right now. I was Americanized it

213
00:19:52,000 --> 00:20:00,000
too much.

214
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:08,000
So he is an Ergo fan and so our partner,
one of our partners from Buenos Aires,

215
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:15,000
they run an on-chain payment network, and
of course, you know, legacy and on-chain

216
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:22,000
payment network.

217
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:29,000
And these guys have, and I think I told
you, QX, about this. I'm pretty sure I

218
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:36,000
did. In fact, I'm positive I did. They got
a huge mining farm for Bitcoin.

219
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:43,000
And so they wanted to actually know what
can be done with Ergo if they were going

220
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:50,000
to turn that on to Ergo. But the problem
is that the bulk of it is ASIC.

221
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Yeah, so that's the problem. They have
some video card, just strictly video

222
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:07,000
card-based miners, but the bulk of it is
ASICs. So we're trying to figure it out.

223
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,000
We're going to see what can be done with
the ones that are not ASICs, which could

224
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,000
still help, help secure the network. But
it would be really nice if we could turn

225
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,000
on the bulk of these things. But the bulk
of these things, yeah. Unfortunately

226
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,000
they're ASICs, but well, we'll see what we
can do so They're gonna sell them for GPUs

227
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,000
and I'll let him know that Just take like
a 30% hit no big deal They got like some

228
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,000
insane amount of hash like hash rate
happening with all those ASICs like it's

229
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:42,000
told me I was like, holy shit.

230
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I mean it's It's one of the largest ones
in Argentina, I think.

231
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Do they have hydro nearby?

232
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Well, so even hydroelectric? Yes. Yeah,
actually, there's quite a bit of

233
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:08,000
hydroelectric in Argentina. In fact, I
think that there are, I've heard, I

234
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:13,000
haven't actually seen them, but I've heard
that there are hydro-powered miners in

235
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Argentina for Bitcoin.

236
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
So I, you know, I'm also going to
research that, see what we can do for

237
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Ergo. There's quite a bit, you know,
because Argentina is, is like very, like

238
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
adaptive now to try and get, try to get
into the opportunities that they have now,

239
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
because it just really opened up after you
know, decades of corruption, and then, you

240
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,000
know, just literally like I think Milei is
literally the first guy who really kind of

241
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,000
opened up Argentina.

242
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
And so now they're just opening up,
they're like, oh, wait, wait, we got all

243
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
this opportunity now. Okay, so what can we
do? And so of course, the first thing

244
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
they're doing is jumping into a bunch of
Bitcoin stuff. But we will, you know, I'll

245
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
see what I can do to guide them in the
right direction, so to speak.

246
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Maybe we'll send QX out there in his
poncho and they'll think he's local.

247
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
No, that's perfect. Lucy and I can go
down and I'll wear my poncho. She can wear

248
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
her poncho.

249
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
You know the thing about Argentina, I
know it's kind of a duh, but like, you go

250
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
to Argentina, and you know it's big on the
map, but you don't realize how big it is.

251
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
It's freaking big, man. There's a lot of
Argentina.

252
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I took so many plane rides, all these
different provinces. And actually, yeah, I

253
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:48,000
think actually in Cordoba, there could be
some hydroelectric opportunities. Also, I

254
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:56,000
think I might have something, so we do
have some connections there that I can tap

255
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:04,000
into if you have something in mind for
some hydro-powered mining stuff.

256
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Well, for ASICs, we'd have to wait for
some sort of sidechain, right?

257
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,000
I'm not saying all of them are ASICs,
just this one partner of ours has a huge

258
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:20,000
amount of ASIC rigs. And so I was trying
to, because they were really interested in

259
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,000
mining Ergo, but then they gave me the
configurations and I'm like, oh, wait a

260
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:30,000
second, yeah, that's not going to work.
It's not going to work here.

261
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So there's going to be
something, you know, I mean, like I said,

262
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,000
they're very, very open to opportunity
over there, so.

263
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Dan, I saw you repping Ergo with your
Ergo sweatshirt on your talk with Charles

264
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Hoskinson.

265
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
How'd that go?

266
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Hoskinson? Who's that?

267
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
I don't even know his last name. I don't
pay attention to that crap.

268
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
What's his last name? Is it like
Rubenstein or something? What is it?

269
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
How'd you guess? How'd you guess?

270
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Oh, Hoskinson?

271
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
There you go. How'd that go? You repped
Ergo? You had your shirt out that you

272
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
stole from us?

273
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Some weirdo gave me
that t-shirt, or gave me that sweatshirt,

274
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:14,000
and I kind of like it. So yeah, I thought
I'd rep Ergo. I was kind of thinking. I'm

275
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:19,000
like, hmm, well, this is the Cardano
founder. But then I'm like, oh yeah, but

276
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:24,000
he's also an Ergo guy too, so it's cool.
And yeah, I just, you know.

277
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,000
It worked out but yeah Do I wear the
t-shirt with soy sauce stains on it or do

278
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,000
I wear the Ergo shirt?

279
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:38,000
It was a tough choice That is that is
pretty racist you think because I live in

280
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Asia I'll have soy sauce stains on my
shirt That's just you've been canceled QX.

281
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:48,000
I just can't do it Andy Andy cut his feet
cut his feet Andy

282
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,000
So how was the, how was your presale? I
saw you announced round two.

283
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Well, so, so like, you know, with
Charles, the talk with Charles is really

284
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:04,000
good. We actually mentioned, Oh, thank
you. Thank you. Oh, damn, he's back.

285
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Anyway, yeah, so we actually did talk
about Ergo a bit. And so there's, you

286
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,000
know, it's just very interesting because,
you know, Charles is kind of into partner

287
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:20,000
change right now. So he's kind of, you
know, multi-chaining, multi-chain surfing

288
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,000
right now.

289
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Yeah, yeah, the pre-sale is doing really
good. Yeah, we're in phase three now, so

290
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:39,000
phase one and two is done. Phase three is
going, and yeah, I mean, we got everything

291
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:45,000
lined up. We're going to go TGE next
month.

292
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Got some RSV that came in through the
pre-sale. Because we, you know, like, are

293
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:59,000
basically, you can participate in the
pre-sale with RSV, ADA, USDM, and that's

294
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:06,000
it, I think. And maybe there's something,
one more.

295
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:13,000
But anyway, oh, and of course, you know,
we got Pyro on our team now. I don't know

296
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:19,000
if you know this or not, but Pyro has
joined our team a couple of months ago.

297
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:25,000
So, we are now, four, out of, well, five
actually, cause Sam was also an Ergonaut.

298
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:31,000
So, out of a team of 20 that are Ergo
peeps, we got Luca, we got Shashir, you

299
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:37,000
know, and we got, yeah.

300
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Oh, oh, and, Rob just joined the team as
well.

301
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Wait, Rob, Rob, Rob.

302
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:57,000
No rob, i'm gonna butcher them Luivatra
You stole Luivatra.

303
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Yeah. Yeah, he's mine now gosh in the
back You done Luivatra there goes Paideia

304
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Yeah, yeah, we're gonna have to hire
somebody for Paideia To the clutches of

305
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Palmyra

306
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Yeah. So yeah, yeah. He's working with us
now as well. So we got, yeah, we got

307
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Luivatra. We got me, Sam, Shashir, Luca,
Pyro. So it's like the Ergo All-Stars. I

308
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:30,000
mean, Alex is advising us.

309
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
The only one that's left out with no
chair when the music stops is QX. What's

310
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
up there?

311
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
I figured that was intentional, Dan. I
figured it was intentional.

312
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,000
So I think that's a feature, not a bug.

313
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
I think it's great that you're, you know,
cause one of the things you notice in, at

314
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
least in the bear market, we noticed that,
you know, devs need to eat something,

315
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
right? It's people like mgPai going to
school, they need some sort of sustenance

316
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
to be able to survive.

317
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,000
And the fact that, at least Palmyra right
now can provide who's Ergo, who's part of

318
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Ergo, part of Cardano. who can provide
these devs with some sort of sustenance so

319
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:12,000
that they can survive on chain and
continue to be here is fantastic.

320
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:20,000
I like to have a pool of talent I can
pull from. It's people that I know, people

321
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:28,000
that I can trust. For me, right now, it
would be a pain to go through the entire

322
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:36,000
process. I'd rather actually work with
somebody I know. Ergo's got oodles of

323
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:44,000
amazing devs and builders in the
ecosystem, so that's why we're working

324
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:52,000
with the ecosystem. It only makes sense.

325
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Well, kushti, we didn't hear what's new
from you.

326
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:02,000
A lot of things. But yeah, there was
intense chats, the developers chat

327
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:08,000
yesterday, as usually. So yeah, well,
sub-blocks implementation is going well.

328
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:14,000
So yeah, I made some API methods even. So
now I'm checking how things are

329
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:20,000
progressing well with some API methods.

330
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Then, yeah, well, all the issues found in
6.0 are fixed. So I'm going for public

331
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:34,000
testnet release. So, well, looking, trying
to find who is mining in the testnet. It

332
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:40,000
seems it is you, right? Only if it's you.
But yeah, I don't know. There is some

333
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:46,000
miner, but cannot really find it.

334
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,000
I think that's mgPai. My node is up to
date and my mining core is running fine on

335
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,000
my server, but I think when I tried to
remote into my basement miner, it was

336
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,000
choking.

337
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:08,000
There is no need to mine, right? There is
need to find the current miner. It's one

338
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:16,000
party at the moment, some party, but it's
not Michael, it's not mgPai.

339
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Oh, it's not mgPai.

340
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Yeah, it's not you then. I don't know. So
we need to update the public testnet. So

341
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:33,000
to make a warning and activation of 6.0, I
think it's quite ready. And then, yeah,

342
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:41,000
well, final audit and we are good for
mainnet warning and activation.

343
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Then, Yeah, well, pushing DEX developers
also, well, it's a little bit hard

344
00:31:53,000 --> 00:32:03,000
because, well, it seems that there is no
synchronization, basically. So trying to

345
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:13,000
get guys in sync, to get UI and main
deployments finally done. Well, it's a

346
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:23,000
long story, but Yeah, at this point, well,
the only thing I can do is just push the

347
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:33,000
front-end and back-end developers to get
in sync and deliver the back-end and UI.

348
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Then what else? Also, participating in
some forum discussions in regards to

349
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:51,000
real-world assets and DAO. Actually, it's
interesting to have Luivatra in Palmyra

350
00:32:51,000 --> 00:33:00,000
because there is a transmute DAO idea on
the forum by some guy.

351
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Well, we're actually setting up a DAO for
Palmyra Economy. That's one of our pillars

352
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:13,000
for Palmyra Economy, is there's going to
be a DAO that is basically going to work

353
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:19,000
in a sense like one of the core entities
to drive decentralized business

354
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:25,000
development. So we'd use the DAO to vote
on proposals like in Catalyst, but

355
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:31,000
hopefully without all the drama, to
develop business in different regions.

356
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Yeah, but then there could be also
smaller DAOs like, well, I proposed many

357
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:47,000
months before Paideia launch and we will
propose again when I will have some time

358
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:55,000
to have gold oracle pool operators DAO,
which is uniting gold oracle pool

359
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:03,000
operators with gold related products
developers such as Gluon and Dexy.

360
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:09,000
The idea is to have DAO with deciding
some things in regards with how to spread

361
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:15,000
reward tokens and so on. Currently it's
done just in the chat but it would be more

362
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:21,000
clear and more transparent to do with the
DAO. The same could be done with lithium

363
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:27,000
oracle operators and lithium product
developers as well.

364
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:36,000
It also would be an interesting option to
have some smaller DAOs for very concrete

365
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:44,000
and specific niches. Also writing some
forum posts with some things well, which

366
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:52,000
I'm talking about things like Cardano
Summit, so maybe the North, if we had such

367
00:34:52,000 --> 00:35:00,000
discussions, right.

368
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:09,000
So, well, the idea is how to have a
unified vision, right, about what, well,

369
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:18,000
the ecosystem is and could be, right, in
the future. So, well, how to combine well

370
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:27,000
DeFi we have and the real world assets and
then well different peer-to-peer cache

371
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:36,000
constructions well things like ChainCash
and so on right to have some well

372
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:45,000
ecosystem which is which can be
well-transformative rights for large-scale

373
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:54,000
transformations and mass adoption.

374
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:07,000
We'll visit Hong Kong in February, so
we'll see then again.

375
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:14,000
So, actually, we've got to talk
potentially about maybe doing some Palmyra

376
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Ergo thing over there. We've been talking
to a friend. You know bond villain looking

377
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:28,000
friend who who's been helping us set up
some stuff in Hong Kong. So yeah, we got

378
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:35,000
to talk about that off offline
potentially.

379
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Well, we already talked about it, but we
got to see what we can do because there's

380
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:45,000
going to be quite a few people over there.
I think that if we do an event in a kind

381
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:50,000
of a nice place, not too huge, but
something where it's going to be just very

382
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:55,000
organic and interesting, I think, I think
we can attract some people there. There's

383
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:00,000
going to be, like I said, there's going to
be a lot of like, you know, usually, you

384
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:05,000
know, the Hong Kong events are pretty,
like there, there's a lot of people, so it

385
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:10,000
could potentially bring some, you know, a
lot of fresh meat over there.

386
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,000
There's an IHOP over there, isn't there
Dan?

387
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:21,000
In Hong Kong? I know there's Anytime
Fitness in Hong Kong. That's also how I

388
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:27,000
chart the world, because I got this gym
membership that actually works in several

389
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:33,000
countries, including the US. It's a US
company that actually operates a pretty

390
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:39,000
large gym network in Japan.

391
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:47,000
So they're really big in Japan, but
there's quite a few of them in the US,

392
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:53,000
plus some other countries. With Singapore,
there was Anytime Fitness in Singapore and

393
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:59,000
other Asian countries. And so I just kind
of always chart my travels. I don't feel

394
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:05,000
like looking for a hotel with a gym
because those are more expensive.

395
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:11,000
So I'll just get an Airbnb next at
Anytime Fitness. And yeah, the closest

396
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:16,000
IHOP I know is actually in Dubai, I think.
Yeah, Dubai, Dubai is the, yeah, whenever

397
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:21,000
I'm in Dubai, I always hit up the IHOP
over there. So I don't have to go down to

398
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:26,000
the US, but unfortunately they haven't
discovered the wonder of IHOP in Japan,

399
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:31,000
but yeah, QX.

400
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,000
So when we're there at Rare Evo, you're
gonna be at Rare Evo, right?

401
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Next year? Is that this year?

402
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,000
This year. This is 2025, the beginning of
2025.

403
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
We'll see. We'll talk in the Sigmanauts
about it.

404
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Let's not talk about it. Let's just
fricking go. Let's go. You owe me at least

405
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:56,000
like three trips to IHOP. I'm sure I do. I
did you one in a really nasty way one time

406
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:02,000
and that was the first time. That was the
first impression is the only impression.

407
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
That's true. That's true.

408
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Oh, yeah, so you screwed up. But yeah,
Alex, let's see if we can do something in

409
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Hong Kong. Let's get some new eyes and new
faces in the ecosystem.

410
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Yeah, so actually we had a meet-up there
back in 2019, so we have some, well, old

411
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Ergonauts in the town. well some were
active in the chats after so one guy Sam

412
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:37,000
was a video operator actually at the
meetup and yeah so some other guys and

413
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:44,000
well yeah there was one guy oh but yeah so
he's in the town but he didn't attend that

414
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:51,000
meetup but yeah he bought like two
Bitcoin's worth of ERG just a few days

415
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:58,000
after the mainnet launch.

416
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:09,000
One guy from one of the biggest VCs
actually in the cryptocurrency space. This

417
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:15,000
time I will meet a lot of guys from the
biggest Asian VCs to check the temperature

418
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:21,000
in the room. It's a quite interesting time
right now, so well at least it's worth to

419
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:27,000
check the temperature.

420
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Are you going QX or are you going to stay
at home and not do anything again?

421
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
It's in Dubai or Hong Kong?

422
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Hong Kong.

423
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,000
I'd love to. That'd be amazing.

424
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:45,000
So let's go. Happening next month.

425
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
It's tough.

426
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:52,000
That's not tough. You just buy a plane
ticket and go.

427
00:40:52,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Talking about things, when you will be in
Argentina again, then? Maybe I will come.

428
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Yeah, actually, that would be great if
you could come along late March, early

429
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
April.

430
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Oh, let's see. But it's really tough.
Yeah, especially around that time. Let's

431
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,000
see.

432
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Yeah, we're probably going to go right
after, so we're going to go to the US for

433
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:21,000
the World Tea Expo and just myself and
Theodore. Business development and then

434
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:25,000
we're going to go to Argentina from there.
Before that, I'm going to go to Sri Lanka

435
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:29,000
and lose some weight eating super hot
curry.

436
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:38,000
All right, but actually, so in April, I'm
planning to visit Japan, actually. But

437
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:45,000
it's closer to late April, and it will be
Miyako-jima Islands. And then, yeah, I can

438
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:52,000
visit also Tokyo or, well... You should go
Miyako-jima to Osaka.

439
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Yeah, Osaka, sure, yeah.

440
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, Miyako-jima.
Yeah, yeah, Miyako-jima is nice, yeah.

441
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Yeah, so there will be a financial
cryptography conference there this year.

442
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
In Miyako-jima?

443
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,000
In Miyako-jima, yeah. So that's an island
conference, so you know, well, one year

444
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,000
they're organizing a conference somewhere
around the Caribbean, and the other year

445
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,000
they're organizing it's Well, it's some
islands in Asia or Europe. So yeah, it was

446
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Malta before and Borneo and now...

447
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Oh yeah, remember Malta, that was what,
2016, right?

448
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:44,000
17, it was April 2017, yeah, beginning of
April. And yeah, it was, there were a lot

449
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:53,000
of people there, right? So Charles, so the
whole IOHK, I believe. back then. Oh,

450
00:42:53,000 --> 00:43:02,000
yeah, yeah. Wait, wait, wait. What I'm
talking about. I met you there. Yeah.

451
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
So are you talking about just Miyako-jima
in Okinawa? Or are you talking about the

452
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,000
main? Because there's a lot of
Miyako-jimas.

453
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Oh, so some islands nearby Taiwan,
actually.

454
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Oh, that's Okinawa, yeah. Okay, well,
that's about an hour by plane from me, an

455
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:23,000
hour and a half by plane from me, so. All
right, so you can... Can't drive to

456
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Okinawa, unfortunately, but in April, it's
actually probably gonna be really nice.

457
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:33,000
April is already nice and warm over there,
so I might actually just gonna come and

458
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:38,000
hang out with you over there, and then we
can take a ride back to Osaka.

459
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
All right, all right.

460
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,000
We got 12 minutes for questions, but
before I started those, kushti, while you

461
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
guys were talking about Japan, I looked up
my testnet miner, and I am the single

462
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,000
miner, so good news. You want me to stop
it? What's the deal there? We'll connect

463
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,000
later.

464
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:59,000
No, no, no. So just mine and wait for
instructions.

465
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Just keep on going. Okay. I'll hold
tight. That is me. Good. Okay.

466
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Stop and wait for instructions, QX. Don't
be a hero.

467
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Only on Ergo can you set something up and
forget about it and forget it was you. And

468
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,000
then months later, it's like, oh yeah,
that's me.

469
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:21,000
All right. So yeah, I will just provide
you a 6.0 jar. And yeah, you will need to

470
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:27,000
put, well, one value in a config file. And
then, yeah, the rest will be done

471
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:33,000
automatically, like voting and activation.
Perfect. And yeah, we will enjoy public

472
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:39,000
testing of 6.0 features in the testnet.

473
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Nice.

474
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,000
All right, so let's jump on the
questions. Let's start. OK, so here's one.

475
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,000
What does Charles think about Rosen
Bridge?

476
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:55,000
So actually, we had quite a few
conversations about Rosen Bridge with

477
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Charles in the past. He's very interested
in it. I mean, it's great tech. Now we

478
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:05,000
are, I mean, we haven't really kind of
carried those conversations over any

479
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:10,000
further beyond just the initials, but
yeah, he had nothing but good to say about

480
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:15,000
it.

481
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:20,000
And, you know, it says it's good tech and
it's good that it's an ecosystem. So

482
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:25,000
potentially down the road, we can
integrate it a little bit more with what

483
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:30,000
IOG is doing maybe do a, you know, Rosen
Bridge to midnight, something like that.

484
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:35,000
That would be interesting, I think.

485
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Yeah. So recently I watched you guys'
video. So you and Charles talked about

486
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Rosen Bridge and Charles mentioned that,
well, Hydra would be beneficial for Rosen.

487
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:56,000
And yeah, well, It's very true.

488
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:03,000
By its design, Hydra is most beneficial.
Hydra is a high-performance layer 2 on

489
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Cardano, but it also could be ported to
Ergo without the hassle and yeah, it's

490
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:15,000
well, super beneficial for federated
protocols like Rosen and Oracle pools

491
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:21,000
actually, right?

492
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:30,000
So for Oracle pools, you may have just
one on-chain transaction in case of Gold

493
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Oracle pool, for example, right? Instead
of 20 per epoch, right? So you can reduce

494
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:46,000
on-chain loads by 20x, right, basically.
Well, in an optimistic scenario. So, well,

495
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:54,000
most of the time, basically, like 99.99%
of the time, right.

496
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:03,000
And yeah, the same about Rosen. So you
can greatly reduce blockchain loads, so

497
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:11,000
reduce fees by using Hydra for Rosen. And
yeah, that's actually a super good point.

498
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:19,000
So well, federated protocols such as Rosen
and Oracle pools can get well, a lot of

499
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:27,000
boosts without any reduction in security
from Hydra.

500
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Yeah, totally. Yeah, we had those good
conversations about Hydra. He's actually

501
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,000
been talking about Ergo spinning up a
Hydra head for quite a while now, so maybe

502
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:42,000
that's something we should look into.

503
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Right, yeah. Sounds beneficial, right?
And yeah, especially for federated

504
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:56,000
protocols. And we have a few of them
already.

505
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Yeah, let's see. Okay, so what do you
guys think about the Miners Rights

506
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Protocol?

507
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Oh, QX. Are you with us?

508
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:16,000
I'm here, I'm here, I'm awake, I'm alive,
I'm alive. So Miners Rights is a protocol

509
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:21,000
of something that was developed in the
Sigmanauts mining pool, spearheaded by

510
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Mark the Shark, and it's like... Oh, I
see, he's like, hey guys, what do you

511
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:31,000
think about... The miners' rights
protocol.

512
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:36,000
No, no, no. I have been... So, Sigmanauts
mining pool has been running without me

513
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,000
for a long time now. Mark the Shark is in
full command of this. I don't even mine to

514
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:44,000
it because I'm using my RTX 3090 to mine
testnet, kushti. So, I can't even mine to

515
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:48,000
it anymore.

516
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:57,000
What the most? Actually I'm thinking
about rewarding testnet miners at some

517
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:03,000
point by building trustless, first
trustless pegging right between Ergo

518
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:09,000
mainnet and Ergo testnet and then you can
bring testnet ERGs to the mainnet and

519
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:15,000
Well, establish liquidity pool, and then
it could be like a sort of meme coin,

520
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:21,000
maybe, right?

521
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Oh, that would be interesting. I could
also see Mark integrating testnet into the

522
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Miners Rights Protocol rewards so that
somehow get just in some sort of public

523
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:35,000
database, perhaps, entering your mainnet
address into the chain so that it could be

524
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:39,000
read so that you could also be rewarded on
mainnet with the Miners Rights Protocol by

525
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:43,000
mining testnet.

526
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:51,000
So yeah, Miners Rights Protocol is like
Mark's original idea on steroids.

527
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Essentially, it's minting a token to be
kind of to designate yourself to a pool,

528
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:59,000
the Sigmanauts pool at this point. And
then that gives you mining rights to the

529
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:03,000
pool, which also allows for rewards and
bonus tokens and distributions during that

530
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:07,000
mining process.

531
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:15,000
So it's essentially not a commitment
protocol, but he's calling it a Miners

532
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Rights Protocol. But the PDF is right on
the Ergo main web page. I encourage you

533
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:23,000
guys to read it. It's essentially Mark's
imagination, Mark's dream child, and it's

534
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:27,000
going to be pretty damn cool.

535
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Also, if you go into the weeds, imagine
Setting permissions and configs via NFTs

536
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:39,000
minting for your mining instead of going
to a website and logging your IP and

537
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:44,000
setting your configs there in case the
website goes down. I think about HiveOS.

538
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:49,000
How cool would HiveOS be if you could set
your configs for all your rigs in an NFT

539
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:54,000
that you hold in your mining wallet and
then that could read the mining wallet as

540
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:59,000
opposed to... Right. What happened to
HiveOS six months ago? They lost

541
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:04,000
everybody's configs and burn out some
people's cards almost

542
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
So, stuff like that would be really cool
and is possible with the Miners Rights

543
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
Protocol.

544
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Yeah, that sounds interesting.

545
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,000
Yeah, yeah. So, check it out. It's way
more technical than I'm explaining. I'm

546
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,000
just giving a high overview. The PDF's
right on the website. Just type in Ergo

547
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Miners Rights Protocol. It should be the
top result.

548
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Yeah, actually good for miners' privacy,
right?

549
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Exactly, 100%. Yep.

550
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Many miners do care about privacy,
actually, and that's good.

551
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Yeah Yeah, all right. All right. Let's
see. We've got a couple more questions

552
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:46,000
here. oh, has kushti ever tried to play
Cyberverse We talked about this.

553
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:50,000
It's a no-go. We want kushti to program.
We don't want him to sit and play

554
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Cyberverse for 10 hours.

555
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:59,000
That's a no-go Mr QX the party pooper
says it's a no-go

556
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:05,000
All right, so maybe this weekend, yeah,
actually, I need to spend the weekend on

557
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:11,000
doing slides for Hong Kong and yeah, well,
doing some more writing. So hopefully,

558
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:17,000
well, I need to finish something and then
hopefully can open the draft of the Ergo

559
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:23,000
book, I mean the structure.

560
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:31,000
So it's just... You could be like Elon
Musk and you can pay me to run the kushti

561
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Cyberverse account and I'll run it for you
and everybody can think it's you.

562
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Don't pay QX for anything. It's going to
go out and buy weird ponchos and dogs.

563
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:44,000
What do we got?

564
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Okay, is there a way to find out how many
participants are in the SigmaUSD Oracle

565
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:53,000
pool?

566
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:59,000
SigmaUSD Oracle pool, yeah. So currently
it's just about four or five Oracle pools

567
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:05,000
and yeah, you can find them on the
blockchain actually, right? So by just

568
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:11,000
tracking transaction and the maximum
amount possible now I believe is about

569
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:17,000
like year 12 but yeah only four or five
participating because of lack of

570
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:23,000
incentivization and that's why well there
is a community now well organized, about

571
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:29,000
launching, version two pool well with,
incentivization, right in the form of

572
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:35,000
token like, GARD, but now it would be, I
don't know, maybe dollar, oracle for

573
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:41,000
reward token, right.

574
00:53:45,000 --> 00:54:00,000
And then, lithium, token would be Lord,
So it's lithium oracle reward token.

575
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:04,000
My reward for running SigmaUSD Oracle
pool is that kushti talks to me every two

576
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:08,000
weeks to remind me to consolidate my
wallet because my Oracle stopped

577
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:12,000
reporting. So that's my reward.

578
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Yeah, so that's actually another problem
of version one, which is fixed in version

579
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:23,000
two. So there is no dust in version two,
right? So currently we are discussing how

580
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:28,000
to update the version one.

581
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:38,000
which is also a bit tricky it seems, but
previously we updated a few times version

582
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:46,000
2 and well, it went smoothly after all, I
believe. but it was before Gluon and Dexy,

583
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:54,000
so well, let's see, so now it will be a
bit more complicated, I believe.

584
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:03,000
But yeah, it's better to update because,
well, we cannot rely on goodwill in the

585
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:10,000
long-term, right, so there is need to have
more sound and incentive-compatible

586
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:17,000
protocol. So version 2, And yeah,
hopefully there will be more people there.

587
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:24,000
So well, if you are talking about gold
pools, so we have maximum number of

588
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:31,000
operators about 20. So yeah, exactly 20
right now, I believe. And yeah, well,

589
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:38,000
online we have currently from 14 to 18,
right? So well, good number actually.

590
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Once again, Oracle version 2 is like
bulletproof, at least from tech running

591
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:51,000
it. I mean, I check on it every couple of
months, kushti, and I'm like, oh, yeah,

592
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:55,000
but still reporting, still good.

593
00:55:55,000 --> 00:56:02,000
It's just like... Yeah, so... Actually,
my Oracle is getting issues, but yeah,

594
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:09,000
they are coming from CoinGecko, so it
seems my IP is blocked by CoinGecko. But

595
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:16,000
yeah, it's probably because, well, along
with Oracle, I'm running also some other

596
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:23,000
scripts, which are well, fetching data
from CoinGecko.

597
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:31,000
So probably, yeah, that's too much for
them. So my Oracle, yeah, often only

598
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:38,000
because of CoinGecko not providing data to
post on the chain. So, yeah, I need to do

599
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:45,000
something. Let's see.

600
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:49,000
We got a good question at the bottom,
Dan.

601
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:53,000
Is that because it's addressed to you,
QX?

602
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:56,000
no i think anybody can answer that
honestly i don't know why i think we can

603
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,000
all
