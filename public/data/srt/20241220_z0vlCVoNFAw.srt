1
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Hello and welcome to the Ergo AMA.

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
How are you doing, kushti?

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Good morning.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Yeah, hello everyone.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Yeah, I'm good.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I'm drinking some tea with a cookie.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So yeah, actually a lot of things to talk
about.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
So maybe let's start with you.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
And then I will take a lot of time.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So yeah, let's start with smaller.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
No problem.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
So what do we do?

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Let's see, on a personal front, I've
successfully deployed our blockchain to

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
one of our main systems here at Cornell.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
So I think I've talked about it before.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
We have a fairly large system that I
built that allows students to submit files

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
for large format printing.

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
And we do about

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
It's been going around for about four or
five years now.

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
We have about 65,000 rows in the
database.

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
So that's a lot of like, you know, 60
inch by 42 inch large format plots that go

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
through the system.

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
So the idea would be in the past, they
used to have the ability to leave for the

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
students to pay in cash, but that got
taken away when Cornell went to a new

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
system.

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
And so that's when we branched off on our
own and built our own system.

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
And so right now, they're only allowed to
be billed through the bursar.

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
They're only available for that.

29
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
So the idea was to give them a different
avenue of billing methods, because you

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
have a lot of professional students that
come in that are like, I don't want to use

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
a bursar system, as well as create some
sort of LETS system.

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
That's a double thing.

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Some sort of LETS ability for people to
develop some sort of local economy, right?

34
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
So last week I built into the BRICK
token.

35
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
We had a discussion about it around the
IT table here about what would be the best

36
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
name to name this token for an
architecture, city planning and art

37
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
department combined and the idea I guess
was BRICK, you know, it's a building block

38
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
for everything there so

39
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
We called it BRICK and it's a Cornell
BRICK and that's going to be our LETS

40
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
token essentially.

41
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,000
So the idea is that I tried to think of a
way that would possibly allow students to

42
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
interact with the blockchain with the
least barrier of entry.

43
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
And what better way to do that than
Luivatra's tipper bot, right?

44
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Because we're already running a huge
discord where most of our students are

45
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
already in it and it's how they
communicate with IT.

46
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
It's how they communicate with the desk
when they're using our systems and that

47
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
kind of thing.

48
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
So what we did, what I did over the last
couple of days and a little bit last week

49
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
is I integrated a Nautilus wallet
integration on the front end portal where

50
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
you submit your large format prints.

51
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
You can click a button that says
blockchain payment.

52
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:12,000
and it then automatically pings you in
Discord, our Discord server.

53
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
And it says, Hey, qx(), it looks like you
sent out plot 5,728.

54
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
It's 32 inches by 48 inches.

55
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
It's $7.80 in US dollars.

56
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
If you need to pay this much and it
lists, it has a code copy block for all

57
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
the tipper code for ERGs.

58
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
So it'd be like 2.2 or 3.3 ERGs.

59
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
And then underneath that, there's another
code block that says, if you want to pay

60
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
in BRICK,

61
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It's going to be, we're giving like,
we're rounding down for BRICK payments, so

62
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
it's cheaper.

63
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
So it'd be seven BRICK.

64
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
So you just hit the copy block, you
paste, you enter.

65
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
And in the backend system, my system is
watching the wallet.

66
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
And when it sees that exact payment, then
it releases your print to our backend

67
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
portal, where then it can be printed in
the large format print.

68
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
So the idea was to let's get these kids
involved in

69
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
They're, you know, try to jump their own
economy.

70
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
There's so many like tools that are
passed around between the semester.

71
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
There's so many books and other things.

72
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Why not create some sort of system of
value where these kids can have something

73
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
that's valuable to them?

74
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I mean, a lot of these guys are spending
two, $300 a semester on plots and that's

75
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
quite a bit for a student.

76
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
So if there's this kind of incentive to
utilize this token that can help them out

77
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
in the future for selling their old tools
or handing off their stuff to freshmen,

78
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
then we're hoping to hit that.

79
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
And that will eventually trickle into the
DAO as well and work from there.

80
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
So that's one thing.

81
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,000
The other thing, if you guys are watching
MewFinance, you'll notice that we

82
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
We sold four Mac Pros on MewFinance the
other day.

83
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
These are 2000, I think they're 2013
through 2019.

84
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Those trash can Mac Pros, you know,
they're little round circles kind of

85
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
thing.

86
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:11,000
We put them up for 65 ERGs on MewFinance
and one day before that sold pretty quick.

87
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
And then three the next day, and those
sold really, really fast, fast enough to

88
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
where people had to resubmit their
transactions because they were competing

89
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
with other people.

90
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
So that was a lot of fun to see that.

91
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
That money will go right into the Cornell
DAO Treasury to help fund airdropping

92
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
BRICK to student wallets and tipping to
student wallets and that kind of thing as

93
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
well.

94
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
So that's another cool thing that we're
doing.

95
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
We may have some other stuff up in there
as we clear out our IT closet of old

96
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
stuff.

97
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
We have a stack of like Mac minis that
are i5s and i7s that maybe we'll put up.

98
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
There's an iMac back there too, that kind
of thing.

99
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
So we'll see how that goes.

100
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
But that's a lot of fun to use something
like MewFinance, the physical side of the

101
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
store to sell actual goods, just like
eBay.

102
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
It's super, super neat.

103
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
What else?

104
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
In the community, we got our multisig
transaction from the old multisig for the

105
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Sigmanauts to the new multisig for the
Sigmanauts.

106
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
That took a while, but it showed up.

107
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
That was great.

108
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
So we have all our ERGs in the new
multisig.

109
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
We're working on getting the community
tokens from the old multisig to the new

110
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
one.

111
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
As most of you know, we're on the new
Paideia as well.

112
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
So eventually those funds will hopefully
go into Paideia where we can fully manage

113
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
them there.

114
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Let's see, I'll think of it as I'm
talking, kushti, but why don't you jump in

115
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
too?

116
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:43,000
What's new for you?

117
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:50,000
All right, so yeah, in the first place, I
promised to talk about quantum resistance.

118
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Quantum resistance, yeah.

119
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Yeah, so that's why it's a popular topic
these days.

120
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Right.

121
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
So I've heard.

122
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
So with the hype with the Google's
machine, right there, the problem solving

123
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
looks very impressive, but it's
essentially a useless solution, right?

124
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
A problem to solve.

125
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
And these qubit machines are quite a bit
far away from where we think of, you know,

126
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
full blockchain breaking encryption.

127
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Yeah.

128
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:27,000
So still we are decades away from quantum
computers capable to break cryptography,

129
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:33,000
right, modern cryptography.

130
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Well, at least, right, so there are very
different opinions here, actually.

131
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:50,000
So there are opinions even that it's not
possible to build such quantum computers.

132
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:58,000
And yeah, I'm talking about folks working
in the space, so not just amateurs, well,

133
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:06,000
cryptographers even.

134
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
folks actually working in quantum
hardware engineering.

135
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
So yeah, there are very different
opinions.

136
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:23,000
right and so it's not quite clear when we
will see such quantum computers but yeah

137
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:30,000
at least decades away it seems but yeah
well it's important to address those

138
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:37,000
issues anyway right because we are kind of
building a cathedral here right so we are

139
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:44,000
trying to build something which will last
for generations to come right because

140
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Otherwise, it's not that interesting,
right?

141
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I mean, to build just something for one
day.

142
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:00,000
And so, yeah, then what do we have?

143
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:07,000
So here we have Ergo proof of work
consensus right which is secure against

144
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:14,000
quantum computers because well it's based
on hash functions and yeah well it's

145
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:21,000
secure unlike most of proof-of-stake
consensus algorithms right which are

146
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:28,000
relying on signature schemes and some
other primitives based on well

147
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,000
problems which are hard for classical
computers, but not for quantum computers.

148
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
All right, then yeah, it's possible to
update proof of stake algorithms and so on

149
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
to

150
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:51,000
post-quantum options, but it's not
efficient.

151
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Proof-of-work is already the most
efficient consensus algorithm.

152
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Every miner is working on its own.

153
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,000
When you are mining using Sigmanauts
mining pool, right?

154
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Or doing solo mining.

155
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
So you are not talking with other miners,
right?

156
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
So you are just doing your work
asynchronously.

157
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
So you just need to know tip of the
blockchain and that's it.

158
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
So that's the only shared medium.

159
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:29,000
So you are not exchanging messages like
in BFT algorithms and so on.

160
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
And yeah, so proof of work is not just
the most efficient consensus algorithm,

161
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
right?

162
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:43,000
But it's also, well, post-quantum
already, because yeah, hash functions are

163
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:50,000
secure in the presence of quantum
computers.

164
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I mean, all the hard problems in hash
functions.

165
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Then, yeah, we have digital signatures
right here and also we have Sigma

166
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:14,000
protocols and here we don't have quantum
resistance, right?

167
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:22,000
So like for every blockchain, there is no
quantum resistance.

168
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:28,000
So, there is need to consider
alternatives, right?

169
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,000
But the issue is that there are not so
many standardized post-quantum schemes to

170
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
start with, right?

171
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
And all of them are inefficient.

172
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:53,000
So we will lose like 10x to 100x in TPS
immediately, right?

173
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
By switching to post-quantum
cryptography.

174
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
But still we need to consider
alternatives, right?

175
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:04,000
So there are some post-quantum sigma
protocols that exist, but yeah, it's hard

176
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:10,000
to predict when they will be standardized.

177
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Then, we have what? We have post-quantum
signatures, but yeah, just a few options,

178
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:23,000
right?

179
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
And yeah, they're inefficient.

180
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:34,000
So, yeah, it's time to consider
alternatives, right?

181
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,000
But slowly and yeah, well, watching the
space and also considering, well, the

182
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,000
possible options for upgrade, right?

183
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:52,000
So, I don't know, maybe it could be a
side chain, right?

184
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
It's kind of a flexible side chain.

185
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:03,000
maybe other options, maybe starting from
some version of the protocol.

186
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Yeah, we may, for example, allow for, but
we need to consider some options.

187
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
So about the side chain idea, so, I mean,
that's, that sounds great for like slow

188
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
development of it and testing, you know,
before we hit that mark where perhaps

189
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
quantum computing can crack cryptography.

190
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
But doesn't that mean that.

191
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I mean, I think of that as more of an
insurance chain in the meantime, right?

192
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
So if you're worried about the Ergo
security or any other chain breaking down,

193
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
you have the side chain, perhaps you move
most of your stored value over to that

194
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
quantum resistant side chain.

195
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
But doesn't that mean as soon as
something's broken, then the value of the

196
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
original chain is toast.

197
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,000
So essentially the side chain becomes the
only real store of value at that point.

198
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:13,000
And anything that was on the old chain is
toast.

199
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Not necessarily.

200
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I mean, for original blockchain, you can
have some post-quantum contracts as well.

201
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:32,000
For example, signatureless contracts like
DEX contracts and so on, so that they

202
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:39,000
would be secure, as secure as consensus, I
mean post-quantum also.

203
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
It means Spectrum DEX and so on.

204
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Already quantum resistant, right?

205
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Because they're not relying on
signatures.

206
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Unlike actually most of DEXs, right?

207
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
On other chains which do have admin keys
and so on.

208
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:07,000
So those admin keys are not quantum
resistant for starters.

209
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
What if you utilize the quantum side
chain, quantum resistant side chain to

210
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
roll up and provide verifications to smart
contracts on the current Ergo side, on the

211
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
current Ergo chain?

212
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
So a smart contract couldn't execute
unless it got a verification from

213
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
something on the quantum resistant side
chain.

214
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
So your store value still sits on the
main Ergo layer one, but it's waiting for

215
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
some sort of confirmation or proofs from
the quantum side chain before it can fully

216
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
act.

217
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:40,000
So even if something was cracked on the
Ergo chain it couldn't act until the proof

218
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:46,000
was sent over from the quantum side so no
real store of value on the quantum side

219
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:52,000
just for signatures in computing or
security is that something that's possible

220
00:15:53,000 --> 00:16:00,000
We also may develop some post-quantum
wallet contracts.

221
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:08,000
There are actually some works in this
direction, but usually they rely on some

222
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:16,000
well, exotic cryptographic schemes such as
witness encryption.

223
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:24,000
So there is a paper from our friends
Dionysia on some lightweight post-quantum

224
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:32,000
wallet contract but yeah it relies on
witness encryption so kind of cryptography

225
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:40,000
which is not around yet basically which is
very exotic yet but yeah in future i

226
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:48,000
believe there could be such options

227
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,000
We may have post-quantum contracts, like
hash-based signatures may be done in

228
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,000
contracts.

229
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:10,000
There are some roll-up options, like
STARKs, so they are quantum resistant.

230
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:18,000
STARKs, they're not efficient, not very
efficient, but yeah, quantum resistant.

231
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:26,000
So, yeah, well, you can use, for example,
STARK-based roll-up, right?

232
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Quantum-resistant roll-up.

233
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
What about, and this may be a stupid
question, but what about the mining side

234
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
of this?

235
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:40,000
So why not develop a qubit machine to
mine the hell out of Autolykos too and

236
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:46,000
steal the hash rate, get 99% of the hash
rate?

237
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Is that something that we were worried
about at all?

238
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
If in the future, those quantum machines
can be cloned to deliver that kind of

239
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
power?

240
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
So sorry, what exact attack?

241
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Well, let's say you're right, because
quantum machines, from what I understand,

242
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
they don't need the CPU can be used for
both memory and for processing or

243
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
something like that.

244
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,000
The bits can be an on, off, and a
substate, essentially.

245
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
So it makes it super, super efficient
there.

246
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,000
The question was, what are the
possibilities of quantum machines being

247
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,000
honed or developed to, instead of breaking
cryptography, do some crazy hash rate,

248
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,000
like go against ASIC miners and replace
those or, you know, be honed towards

249
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Autolykos too and just take over the hash.

250
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Like, you don't need to break
cryptography if you can build a machine

251
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
that can just immediately, you know,
dominate the hash rate of any chain.

252
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
But yeah, so we are talking about Ergo
proof of work, right?

253
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,000
So it's based on hash problem and it's

254
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:08,000
So it's quantum resistant, right, to the
best of modern knowledge.

255
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
So it's still a hard problem for quantum
computers.

256
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
And then, yeah, it's also based on a hash
function, but yeah, it's also hard for

257
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
quantum computers, right?

258
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
So you cannot find a collision.

259
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
And so on.

260
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:35,000
So, I mean, there is some speed up, but
it's not significant, right?

261
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:40,000
So still, and yes, okay, some problem.

262
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Well, I've checked recently, actually.

263
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:49,000
And yeah, so there is some speed up, but
yeah, it's not negligible.

264
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:55,000
So yeah, it's still yeah, well, about the
exponential time, right, just with a bit

265
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:01,000
better coefficient.

266
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
So yeah, I mean, proof of work is secure,
right?

267
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
So then the only issue is about
signatures, but there are many options

268
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
right here to consider.

269
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
There is no rush.

270
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:20,000
So yeah, well, then we could be quite
optimistic, I guess, still, yeah, about

271
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:26,000
all those things.

272
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:33,000
There is a need to slowly consider
alternatives and discuss them, but there

273
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:40,000
is no rush talking about implementation.

274
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Still, we have many years to come.

275
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Yeah, I think every five years, kushti,
there's some announcement about some huge

276
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
breakthrough in quantum computing and it
still has been, mediocre announcements,

277
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
you know, way hyped up for what it
actually is or does.

278
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
So this is a cycle.

279
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Yeah.

280
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Every breakthrough is about adding like
five qubits and yeah, we need thousands

281
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
here, right?

282
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Still.

283
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:24,000
And so this Google's new chip, so it's
still very tiny, right, its capabilities.

284
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:32,000
And yeah, it's not quite clear even if
it's possible to build systems with a

285
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:40,000
certain number of qubits because of some
issues with quantum physics.

286
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:53,000
But yeah, it's better to talk with guys
proficient in all that stuff.

287
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
What else is new, kushti?

288
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
What have you been working on?

289
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Yeah, so then I recorded also talk for
the upcoming art events, upcoming modern

290
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:13,000
art events, which will show in particular,
which will be Ergo-centric rights to some

291
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:21,000
degree.

292
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:31,000
And then it will be about using Ergo
tooling for different things, so artists

293
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:41,000
will get to use Ergo tooling right for
their needs.

294
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,000
And yeah, I recorded the talk so it will
be released after 21st on property rights

295
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
in the age of programmable money, right?

296
00:22:50,000 --> 00:23:00,000
So well, the talk is connecting different
dots within the space, right?

297
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Starting from Tornado Cash decision,
recent one, to programmable money and then

298
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:22,000
tokenization of real world assets of art
and so on.

299
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:29,000
So, let's see.

300
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:34,000
So, yeah, well, there is a forum post,
right, made recently on that money

301
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,000
ownership in the age of programmable
money.

302
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Yeah, but yeah, this talk for artists, so
it's about property rights and therefore

303
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:52,000
art objects, some thoughts about art
objects specifically, right, the

304
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:58,000
tokenization and so on.

305
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:06,000
And then, yeah, it's also about how Ergo
tooling rights could be useful for, well,

306
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:14,000
for doing different experiments.

307
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,000
So with property rights, at least, are we
talking about like, with a physical art

308
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,000
piece, right?

309
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Something on-chain verifying, minted by
the artist.

310
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,000
You can trace it back to the artist and
see that the new owner of it has the

311
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,000
actual certification or that traces back
to the original minting wallet of the

312
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,000
artist, verifying ownership and that kind
of thing.

313
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Is that what we're talking about?

314
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Yeah, so it could be physical, right?

315
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
It could be digital.

316
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:49,000
So we can have NFT rights and that NFT
could belong to you, for example, but

317
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:55,000
yeah, it could be minted by contract,
right?

318
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,000
So its transfer sheet could be defined by
contract and so on.

319
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,000
If we are talking about physical art,

320
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Then, yeah, it also can be tokenized with
NFT or with multiple tokens, right?

321
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:20,000
And then, yeah, for the latter option,
you may have very different options, like

322
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:29,000
20% of picture can belong to its author,
right?

323
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Painter.

324
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:38,000
And then 80%, for example, can be sent to
auction contract, right?

325
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,000
To create auctions periodically, like one
token a week, one percent a week, for

326
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,000
example.

327
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,000
You can also bundle it in ChainCash too,
right?

328
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Yeah, so you can actually airdrop to
miners or whatever, right?

329
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:07,000
So you may have digitized arts being
distributed to Sigmanauts and so on.

330
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:13,000
I think there could be a lot of very
unique things here, right?

331
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
When we are talking about, well, work of
artists combined with work of hardware,

332
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
for example, right?

333
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:29,000
So you may have, for example, painter
doing picture first, right?

334
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,000
And then, yeah, well, miners, they were
doing their work to get the right shares

335
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,000
of it.

336
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:48,000
So that's kind of art and hardware work,
right, combined and so on.

337
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:54,000
And yeah, I mean, so such events already
per se, I mean, like art events, right,

338
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:00,000
could be considered like that, like
performance, maybe art performance, right,

339
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:06,000
where you have mining along with the work
of humans done all together and combined

340
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:12,000
via on-chain contracts and so on.

341
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,000
So there are very different options here.

342
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:26,000
And yeah, so that's maybe a small piece,
but I think it's very important to work

343
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:34,000
through this piece and then jump on other
chapters talking about real-world

344
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:42,000
adoption.

345
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:50,000
kushti, you met with some developers, was
it last week?

346
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,000
One of our Sigmanauts pool miners as well
was there.

347
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
What was that chat about?

348
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Yeah, so that was a local developers
meetup, so there was a talk about, I don't

349
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:08,000
know, 2024, right?

350
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:14,000
And I was kind of a blockchain expert,
right?

351
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:20,000
So, well, I did my best to explain what
happened in the space to the general

352
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:26,000
public.

353
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:36,000
So one of the guys there was Netam who's
an avid miner in our pool and speaking of

354
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:45,000
the Sigmanauts pool before I forget I
believe Mark is now fully pushing the

355
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:54,000
bonus tokens and I think a storage rent
payment went out as well they decided to

356
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,000
do storage rent payments based on the
block that they were found in since the

357
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,000
pool is already doing PPLNS based on that
block all you have to do is find the ratio

358
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,000
of payment for that specific block and
then distribute the storage rent based on

359
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,000
that and It works out perfectly.

360
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Super super easy to do that But it's neat
the last I think the week before last we

361
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,000
got some big storage rent payments I think
we got

362
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:27,000
a couple ERG in one payment, almost an
ERG in several more.

363
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,000
So we're doing pretty well in the storage
rent payments.

364
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
But why?

365
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
So have you collected some big boxes
maybe?

366
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Yeah, we got some, it must have been some
big boxes exactly.

367
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Yep.

368
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
All right.

369
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:45,000
So yeah, I've checked recently and yeah,
it seems now a collection going on for

370
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:50,000
some initial tests for Oracle Pools.

371
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,000
So yeah, that could be some big boxes
there.

372
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Yep.

373
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:00,000
We got, we've gotten some funky tokens
that we have no idea what they are and

374
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,000
some no name tokens and then some Oracle
test tokens as well, that we scoop up.

375
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
You know, it's fun to see.

376
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
It's fun to see the history.

377
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
It's like you're an archeologist and
you're kind of just digging up the chain

378
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
and seeing what pops up.

379
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Yeah, so you are basically digging
dinosaur bones, right?

380
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Yeah, that's really cool.

381
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:28,000
And actually, so you can put such tokens
on auctions, right?

382
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Exactly.

383
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,000
I think CannonQ put out a vote on the
Sigmanauts mining thing for the PHP token

384
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:38,000
that they found and I believe he's going
to do something with that airdrop it or

385
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:43,000
some sort of thing or put it out as bonus.

386
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
But that vote was up in the Sigmanauts
mining pool now.

387
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Super neat.

388
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
All right.

389
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,000
So anything else to discuss?

390
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Well, we have, I don't know if I
mentioned this before, maybe I did, but

391
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Cyberverse was in the top of the polling.

392
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
So they won their poll over at Ronin.

393
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
And if people didn't notice, there's now
a wallet connector for Ronin on the login

394
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
screen of Cyberverse.

395
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
So there's Ronin, Ergo, and Cardano.

396
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:22,000
And they just made it so that most or all
of the goods like the skins or the crate

397
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:27,000
boxes you buy with CYPX now no matter what
chain you're coming in on.

398
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,000
So I bought a Cardano skin with CYPX
that's only on Ergo and it went to my

399
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Cardano wallet even though I paid for it
in Ergo CYPX.

400
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
So it's really cool.

401
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:47,000
So it incentivized coming to Ergo,
getting CYPX, and then spending it in game

402
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:53,000
to have your NFT go to whatever wallet
your chain of origin is.

403
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
So if it's on that chain.

404
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
They're minting Ronin NFT.

405
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Did you see the kushti NFT in the Ronin
suit?

406
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:08,000
I think it's like a Ronin suit that I
posted in chat yesterday.

407
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Yeah, I've no idea what Ronin is even.

408
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
So what's that?

409
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Ronin is like a gaming chain,
essentially.

410
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,000
It's gamer focused for that.

411
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
So yeah, so they were branching into
that.

412
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Is it some roll up layer 2 or what?

413
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:32,000
I imagine, I don't know.

414
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
I pay a little bit of attention to that
kind of thing, but yeah.

415
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
So that's great to see CYPX branching out
there.

416
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,000
And yes, Maverick, I did mint a Bobber
emote crate.

417
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,000
I got the crying Bobber with the tears
coming out.

418
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
You have the laughing Bobber.

419
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
I'm not sure which one that is.

420
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
I already mentioned MewFinance, which is
great.

421
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:58,000
And yeah, let's see a few questions.

422
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Yeah, so also some Twitter spaces coming
from UTXO Alliance details will be shared

423
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:10,000
soon.

424
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:19,000
So it's with, yeah, UTXO Alliance
members, some Twitter spaces to join.

425
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Then, yeah, so, probably after New Year,
we'll do new videos.

426
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:36,000
And yeah, I think we'll visit consensus
conference in Hong Kong also.

427
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:41,000
But yeah, let's see.

428
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Then, yeah, so we are actually thinking
about doing maybe some meetups and so on.

429
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
In Hong Kong?

430
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:59,000
We'll check possibilities, maybe
Thailand, Vietnam, something like that,

431
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:05,000
but let's see.

432
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:14,000
There is a lot of development, so it's a
bit...

433
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:21,000
For node development, we just finished
the rework and versioning in 6.0, so there

434
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:28,000
will be a new release candidate this week.

435
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Hopefully, we are already quite close to
the release, so yeah, well, after some

436
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:43,000
testing, so it will be under testing for
like a few days and then, yeah, we will be

437
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:50,000
released maybe around Saturday, right?

438
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
So if I will start testing today.

439
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Then, yeah, well, 5.0 release is coming
as now it's approved.

440
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:13,000
And yeah, so Sigma interpreter release
next week, probably.

441
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,000
So yeah, a lot of things are going on
development wise.

442
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:25,000
And yeah, well, starting from, I don't
know, maybe next week even.

443
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,000
So we can have regular discussions on
sub-blocks, right?

444
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Because well, I'm back on this and yeah
I'm doing already some stuff and yeah we

445
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:49,000
can start this actually a lot of things to
get done there right for sure so yeah well

446
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:59,000
contributors are welcomed well for like
from formalizing security writing tests

447
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:07,000
updating exploiters and so on.

448
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Then for Ledger, well, there are final
conditions about audits, so it should be

449
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:17,000
studied.

450
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
I don't know.

451
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:25,000
But yes, not sure about next week because
it's Christmas, right?

452
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
But let's see.

453
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:40,000
But final talks already with third party
company authorized by Ledger.

454
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Yeah, well, there are a lot of
developments, Oracle Pools, finally done,

455
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:58,000
and so on.

456
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Yeah.

457
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Well, probably please check developers
chats.

458
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Yeah.

459
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:12,000
A lot of things there like, interesting
updates from Nautilus, right?

460
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Then Oracle Pools.

461
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
What else?

462
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:22,000
That's great.

463
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Finally, yeah, there is progress with
Kestrel, also deterministic signature

464
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:32,000
support done.

465
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Yes, so there is no issue with randomness
anymore for the limited hardware.

466
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Then what else, what else?

467
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Yeah, well, a lot of updates as usual,
right?

468
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:03,000
And yeah, so for community discussion, do
you have any plans like Twitter space,

469
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:09,000
community calls, anything?

470
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
With them?

471
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Yeah.

472
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:18,000
You take so alive.

473
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:39,000
It would be with...

474
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Yeah.

475
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,000
I'm for community chats and the start of
the new year, right?

476
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Let's do it.

477
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Let's do it after the new year at some
point, maybe mid January.

478
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,000
That was fun.

479
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Either a zoom or, I prefer the zoom to
the spaces, but but yeah, either one.

480
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:07,000
No, we can also comment about, well, as
usual, real world adoption value

481
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:15,000
proposition.

482
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:21,000
There are books, so I can open source,
the current drafts, right.

483
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Which is mostly about structure still,
but yeah.

484
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Have you found a couple of people, I see
you've invited a few people to write for

485
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,000
you from the book already.

486
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:36,000
You invited Luivatra to talk about
storage rent.

487
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Yeah, Joe or Luis Grayman.

488
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Yeah.

489
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,000
So we have already a few folks willing to
talk.

490
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,000
So well, Joe will put some manifests.

491
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:54,000
the rights of grassroots manifests, the
new one.

492
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,000
And yeah, so some other writing.

493
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,000
So yeah, we can reuse some old writing.

494
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:09,000
And then that there is need to combine
all writings and publish them.

495
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:13,000
All right, so let's jump on the
questions.

496
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
All right, let's see what we have.

497
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Well, some more things about property
rights from Luis Grayman.

498
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:24,000
He says, kushti, most important property
right is to our own identity.

499
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
But now that is just about protecting a
seed phrase.

500
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Please comment on how to make this soul
bound.

501
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:49,000
But it's like what a problem from the
90s, right?

502
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,000
It's not even an issue, right?

503
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:57,000
In the digital world, what do you have?

504
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Well, numbers, right?

505
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Well, you may have a secret number.

506
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:11,000
secret key some very big number right and
yeah well when you use seed so actually

507
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:19,000
you are using a big number in this seed,
right?

508
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:24,000
So it's a secret key from your seed.

509
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:29,000
And then, yeah, so that's what you do
have in the digital world.

510
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:35,000
And then is the whole big issue of how to
connect IDs in the real world, right, with

511
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:41,000
those numbers in the digital world.

512
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:47,000
So that's public key infrastructure,
right?

513
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,000
So, well, in addition to a secret, so you
have some public image of a public key,

514
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,000
right?

515
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,000
And then you may declare the public key
is yours, but then that's how to verify

516
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,000
that, right?

517
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Especially if we are talking about
decentralized settings.

518
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:16,000
So that's actually how, well, the
Cypherpunk period, right?

519
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,000
So initially it was about different
attempts to develop infrastructure for

520
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,000
public keys, right?

521
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Decentralized infrastructure.

522
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,000
So some trust and so on.

523
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,000
So there are just like web of trust,
right?

524
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:43,000
And it's also as well as many other.

525
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Well, the initial setting was to do some
key exchange rights, then exchange emails.

526
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:59,000
For example, there is some person you
have to exchange emails with.

527
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Yeah, so you are using public key
writing.

528
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,000
The problem is how can you be sure that
some public published on the web is all

529
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:17,000
right?

530
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:23,000
So, well, it could be a fake website or
whatever, then you end up with sending

531
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:28,000
email to some fake person.

532
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:32,000
possibly revealing some secret sensitive
data.

533
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:37,000
And then, yeah, there are a lot of
attempts to overcome this, well, by using

534
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:42,000
trusted parties, like you're using
certificates on the internet, right, with

535
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:47,000
trusted issuers.

536
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:54,000
There is somewhat federated approach web
of trust, right, when you trust Joe,

537
00:43:54,000 --> 00:44:00,000
right, which is authorized my key, for
example, right, so first Joe needs to meet

538
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:06,000
me, gets

539
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:11,000
some certification of my public key and
then tell you that this public key is

540
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:16,000
trusted by Joe and then you trust Joe,
right?

541
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:25,000
And you are using my public key because
of that and so on.

542
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,000
You know, if after 30 years, it's the
same issue, basically, that means the

543
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:33,000
issue is hard, right?

544
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Well, it will remain hard, I believe,
because brightest minds, well, in

545
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:44,000
cryptography, practical cryptography, and
not only, well, are working on that for

546
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:49,000
like 30 years to the moment.

547
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Still, you know, the progress is very
limited.

548
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:12,000
And yeah, well, blockchain in some
settings may help, right?

549
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:27,000
But still, the problem remains.

550
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
All right, let's see.

551
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
We've got, CannonQ wanted to mention
Cyberverse and DuckPools, and I forgot to

552
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
mention DuckPools.

553
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
He says, they're two different projects.

554
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Both are attractive to the outside chains
if marketed and supported by the

555
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
ecosystem.

556
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:43,000
So yeah, guys, DuckPools is, I think
their sale is almost up, or a couple more

557
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:47,000
days for their round.

558
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:53,000
DuckPools is, as many know, or many not
know watching this,

559
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,000
a lending pool protocol.

560
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:01,000
So for example, the Sigmanauts had about
2,500 SigmaUSD that we were lending, that

561
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:06,000
we were paying to Rare Evo earmarked for
that.

562
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:13,000
So we put it in DuckPools while we waited
and into the SigmaUSD lending pool.

563
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
And when we pulled it out, it was $3,000.

564
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:19,000
So the thought is, you know, these
protocols exist.

565
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:24,000
If you have SigmaUSD, if that's your
thing, if that's your jam to mitigate risk

566
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:29,000
by having some of your portfolio on that,
then why not put it in a lending program

567
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:34,000
like DuckPools and make some yield off it
while it just sits there for other people

568
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:39,000
that want to take a bigger risk by maybe
shorting or longing ERG at that point.

569
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
So yeah, DuckPools is great.

570
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Check out their IDO.

571
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:45,000
it's essentially you get a staking token
and the quacks are airdropped to you every

572
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:49,000
month or every week or something like
that, depending on how much you bought, in

573
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:53,000
that percentage.

574
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
So super, super cool.

575
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,000
They have their own DAO built in
separate, completely separate of Paideia,

576
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Kaspa built that.

577
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
So yeah, check that out.

578
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Let's see what else we have here.

579
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
We have.

580
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Wombo says, qx(), any worries on creating
BRICK?

581
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Is there any possibility of problems in
trying to create a currency for the

582
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
school?

583
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Cornell already has something called Big
Red Bucks, which is actually digitized.

584
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:28,000
It's on the Cornell student cards.

585
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Students get paid in it, I think, for
some of the work they do, and then they

586
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,000
can spend it at different places on
campus.

587
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
So they already have a system of value
like that.

588
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,000
I don't see how this is any different.

589
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,000
We're not putting it on a DEX, so we're
not putting any monetary value on it as

590
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,000
far as physical real things.

591
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Now that being said, I'm sure, you know,
smart savvy kids might, you know, try to

592
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,000
create liquidity pool on Spectrum DEX.

593
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
It's doubtful, but it's possible.

594
00:47:54,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Yeah, no, I'm not worried about that
Wombo.

595
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:04,000
All right.

596
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Our guest Kent says, do we have any way
of measuring awareness or engagement with

597
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Rosen Bridge among users of other chains,
i.e.

598
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Cardano?

599
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Does anyone outside of the Ergo community
know about it?

600
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:19,000
I would say that from my experience at
Rare Evo, Rosen Bridge is a very

601
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:24,000
well-known name throughout Cardano, at
least.

602
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:31,000
I can't speak to Ethereum, Bitcoin, or
CKB, where they may go next.

603
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:35,000
But yes, I'd say it's very well known.

604
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,000
They'd come to us and they'd see Ergo and
then they'd see Rosen Bridge over in the

605
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,000
corner and they'd be like, oh, you guys
are with Rosen Bridge or you guys are

606
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,000
with, you know, and we're like, oh, no,
we're Sigmanauts with Ergo, Rosen Bridge

607
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,000
is on Ergo and that kind of thing.

608
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
So yeah, I'd say in Cardano it's well
known.

609
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:55,000
I think they're doing a great job of slow
burning their marketing system through,

610
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:59,000
you know, proof of work exactly, you know,

611
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,000
proof of work, they're showing a system
that works well and is trusted.

612
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,000
And I think that's working well for them
to spread across as they go from ecosystem

613
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,000
to ecosystem.

614
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:15,000
The people you talked to, the dev people
you talked to last week, the local dev

615
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:19,000
meetup, they're familiar with Rosen
Bridge.

616
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:27,000
So, they're not very familiar with
blockchains even, right?

617
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Well, I even didn't talk much about the
panel.

618
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:48,000
2024 in blockchain insights and so on.

619
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Well, after I had a talk with developers
in a coffee shop nearby, well, mostly I

620
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:04,000
presented just the idea of programmable
money.

621
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Because for developers it's even more
understandable, like what to do.

622
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:15,000
and where do you inject program, what's
execution context and so on.

623
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:19,000
And so yeah, got some folks excited, some
want more talks just on that, so the idea

624
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:23,000
of programmable money.

625
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:32,000
And well, there are folks now who are
interested in, well, how to contribute,

626
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:40,000
but well, I need to provide more details.

627
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Because for developers interested in
compilers, right, interpreters and so on,

628
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:57,000
well, the idea to make, well, money,
right, programmable it's more

629
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:05,000
understandable than smart contracts,
engineering wise, as well.

630
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Yeah, so that concept wasn't made by
engineers back then, back in 2014.

631
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:28,000
All the engineers kept writing about all
that stuff, so it was predictable.

632
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:33,000
like them, that's decentralized computer,
but to say a fully replicated programmable

633
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:38,000
computer would be overloaded, right, even
with some trivial load, like we have

634
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Ethereum blockchain.

635
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,000
So, well, the world talked about that
back in 2014.

636
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Right, but well, here, well, the idea, do
some work, well, they do that to engineers

637
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:09,000
at least.

638
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,000
All right.

639
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Let's see.

640
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,000
We're getting near time.

641
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:18,000
We have a question from Wombo for you,
kushti.

642
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Can you speak about umbrella tokens and
explain the pattern a bit?

643
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:26,000
How you plan to use ChainCash?

644
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:32,000
So, yeah, well, let's see whether it will
be used, right?

645
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:39,000
But the basic idea that you have some
parent token, right?

646
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:50,000
And you have contracts, which is allowing
you to issue, well, new token, right?

647
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Some certificate issued, right?

648
00:52:52,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Well, in that case, parent's tokens,
right?

649
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:08,000
And by using that, so you can, well,
different tokens, you may issue under some

650
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:14,000
parent token, right?

651
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:18,000
You can certify basically, and that
certification can be later used in

652
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:22,000
contracts.

653
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:31,000
I mean well ChainCash example so what I'm
thinking about is to have a well a reserve

654
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:40,000
track which is issuing well which is
having reserve tokens right and well those

655
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:49,000
reserve tokens can be put on issuing note
to some reserve right with

656
00:53:51,000 --> 00:54:01,000
It was due to a contract-based
certification that the token was actually

657
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:11,000
issued by calling the contract, right.

658
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:22,000
And, yeah, well, it seems a similar
design pattern, well, can be used in other

659
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:32,000
cases as well.

660
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Well, I got a hard stop.

661
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,000
I got to run across campus to another
meeting.

662
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
So this seems like a good place to end.

663
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
All right.

664
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Already.

665
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:47,000
So do we have any questions from previous
AMA?

666
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:51,000
Because yeah, we promised to answer, me
and Joe.

667
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:55,000
What was the previous questions?

668
00:54:55,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Do we have any other, maybe any sign
about this?

669
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:08,000
I don't see any, no, I don't see anything
commenting about last week.

670
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
All right.

671
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:16,000
So folks, well, if you want questions
from last week, answered.

672
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:20,000
So send them next week.

673
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Did you guys chat too long last week and
forgot to answer questions, kushti?

674
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Is that what happened?

675
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
Oh, there are a lot of questions.

676
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:32,000
So yeah, we didn't answer them all.

677
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:37,000
So yeah, we suggested folks resubmit.

678
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:45,000
And yeah, well folks, you can resubmit
them next week then.

679
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Nice.

680
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Well, there is nothing to hide, so every
question will be answered.

681
00:55:55,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Maybe just time is the most important.

682
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,000
All right.

683
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:09,000
Yeah, let's wrap up with this.

684
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:12,000
All right.

685
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:12,000
We'll see you around the ecosystem.

686
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Yeah.

687
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Yeah, let's continue our text chat.

688
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Sounds good.

689
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Thanks so much, everybody.

690
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Have a great weekend.

691
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,000
Bye, everyone.
