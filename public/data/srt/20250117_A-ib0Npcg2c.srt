1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Awesome. Where were we? I was talking
about... Gosh, I even forgot what I was

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
talking about.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
You were looking for people for your...

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Yes, thank you. You're young. Vigiloso.
Yeah, perfect. So that's a general idea,

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
if anything just got cut off or not. This
person will take a little cut off each

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,000
sale. Right now we have a healthy stock of
it looks like we're back on YouTube. So

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,000
that's perfect. Great, and you don't
forget to send me question links. And

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
sure, I still have the old list it's okay.
I'll keep them up Andy. Perfect. Thanks.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
So yeah, so I have all the stock we have
a plethora of Make mining great again

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
hats. We have sweatshirts that have the
Ergo logo on them and we have t-shirts

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
that have the - kushti is there a name for
that guy? What's the name of the astronaut

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Sigmanauts that old little thing?

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
That old do I have a sticker here? Hang
on. Yeah, right here in my drawer.

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
What's his name? Does he have a name,
kushti?

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Oh, but it's just Ergonaut.

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
That's just Ergonaut?

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Yeah, on the moon, yeah.

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Ergonaut, the first.

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Moon mining, yeah.

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Moon mining, perfect.

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Ergonaut, yeah.

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
So we have t-shirts with that logo on
them as well. Yeah. So if you're

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
interested, please reach out to me on
Telegram or respond to that Twitter

24
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
message. As I said, there's already one or
two people interested, I think. So

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
hopefully that'll look up, take a lot of
burden off, spread out the burden, which

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
is good in a decentralized community like
this. So super cool. What else? Oh, I'll

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
show you guys this. Do I have? I can't
show you guys this. But I'm looking at

28
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
loading, I loaded Cyberverse before I
started up, and since their cross-chain

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
launch, they've, they're, I mean, it's
what, 9:26 on Eastern time? And they have

30
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
132 players live in there. Yeah, it's
fantastic. So the streets are busy. You

31
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
hit them, you hit the over you map and you
can see little pink dots walking around.

32
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You know, the green dots are AI, not AI,
but computer players, NPCs and the pink

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
dots are users just bouncing around the
screen. So it's really, really cool to see

34
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
that kind of success. And I think it just
proves that you know, sometimes these

35
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
things take time, right? Not everything's
catch fire and burn fast and this is a

36
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
this is a prime example of a product that
has stayed true to their values and Ergo

37
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
values and just continued to push and
build and they're recognizing success.

38
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Yeah, super super cool Christian we got to
get you on cyberverse man.

39
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Yeah, well, hard to find time, but I'll
try maybe this weekend.

40
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Watch it. kushti discovered Cyberverse
and sub-blocks are in five years. Node 6

41
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
is like 10 years away now. He said, look
at my player level 20 guys. And we're

42
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
like, kushti, go back to sub-blocks, man.
We're going to have to, we'd have to get

43
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Mr. Pixel to shut the servers down.

44
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
That's a fine time, yeah, really.

45
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
So that's really exciting. What else?
Sigmanauts mining pool is still trucking

46
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
along. We are at, let's see, what
gigahash? We're at 72 gigahash this

47
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
morning. Usually we ride around 94, 95,
but sometimes people shut them off for

48
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
night time or daytime, depending if their
electricity costs are high. Mark wrote a

49
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
script last week that automatically clears
out the logs because we you know we're

50
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
running logs on storage rent as well as
mining core so so those guys can build up

51
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
and when we're trying to keep the price of
the servers down we only have about 40

52
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
gigs of playroom so sometimes after a
couple after a month or so those those

53
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
drives can really fill up. So he's written
a script that wipes those logs every once

54
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
in a while to keep the server in tip-top
shape. So that's great. What else? Oh, so

55
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
students come back. Gosh hang on maybe
that's why I feel so depressed lately

56
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Students at Cornell come back come back on
Tuesday because we have Martin Luther King

57
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
down I believe but the good news is that's
when That's when they'll be introduced to

58
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
the Cornell BRICK. So I'm really excited
to see how was that Wait, where have you

59
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
been? What rock have you been living under
this year?

60
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
What a rock. So Cornell BRICK is our idea
of trying to stimulate a local economy at

61
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
my college. So the idea is we have, unless
it's a useful token, then it's never going

62
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
to get used. So we're providing a use for
it. And that use is that I've rewritten

63
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
the front end and kind of a little bit of
the back end of our plot submission

64
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
process. So right now students go to a web
portal, they submit a plot, it goes to the

65
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
back end, our student workers look at the
plot, they open it up, they send it out,

66
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
the students are notified all along the
way and they go pick it up at a cubby when

67
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
they're done. So the idea was to integrate
the blockchain into that. So I've modified

68
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
the front end and like a side bot that
monitors a chain. So when students print,

69
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
they can choose blockchain payment. And as
soon as they choose it, they submit it.

70
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
They get a pop-up in the payment channel
in our Discord. We have a Discord that's

71
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
used by, gosh, we probably have about
1,800 alum and current students in there

72
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
now. So they're gonna pop up there that
says hey so-and-so, you know Your plot

73
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
number was this the cost is this if you
want to pay in ERG copy this text if you

74
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
want to pay in Cornell BRICK Copy this
text. So all it is is code for the tipper

75
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
bot So we're gonna introduce everybody to
the blockchain via the tipper bot. So they

76
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
basically yeah Pacing the code and whether
it's BRICK or ERG and the back end knows,

77
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
you know, it's like it's like auction
house not auction house Ergo raffle where

78
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
it's like five digits of a unique So
that's how we tell who it is, you know

79
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
what I mean So once the scanner sees that
it marks the plot as plottable and then it

80
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
shows up in the back end to the to the
student workers to be able to send it But

81
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
yeah, so we're going to first of all,
we're gonna give BRICK to our student

82
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
workers so there's we have an 18 student
workers that we're gonna give them to so

83
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
that'll hopefully kind of started that
way, as well as we'll have some incentives

84
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
to hand it out to the rest of the student
body as well, maybe a handful to

85
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
everybody. So everybody gets a couple free
plots at the start of the semester if they

86
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
use that system. And then we'll find other
ways to hand them out. So the idea is that

87
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
the plotting center will give this token
kind of a value. You know, like, this is

88
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
valuable to me because instead of spending
$12 on a plot, I'm going to use a couple

89
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
of these tokens. So there's some value
right there for the tokens. So then the

90
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
idea is not everybody's going to use them.
And there can be developing some sort of

91
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
trade in between, like, can we have this
book or this tool? Can I swap you this?

92
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Oh, here's a BRICK for that or that kind
of thing. So that's going to be fun and

93
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
interesting, and that'll of course wrap
into the Cornell demurrage hierarchy as

94
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
well.

95
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
So what is the plot exactly?

96
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Oh, it's just like a 42-inch wide piece
of paper by seven feet. Think about

97
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
architecture plans like, you know,
blueprints, kind of thing. Well, the

98
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
students weekly, every bi-weekly, you
know, several times a month, they'll have

99
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
these critiques where they have to lay out
the boards of their projects, so they'll

100
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
have different views of their building or
their design and different cross-sections,

101
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
and they'll put it all out neatly on a
thing with maybe some explanation

102
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
sometimes. No, usually not text. And
they'll put it up on the boards, and then

103
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
the faculty rake them over the coals and
tell them why they're wrong and why it's

104
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
awful. It's all part of the learning
process in architecture. So that's a plot.

105
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
That's interesting.

106
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, so it's a busy thing in
architecture school. Since 2020, we have

107
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
64,000 plots that have come across our
desk that we've printed for the students.

108
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
So it's a lot. Yeah, it's a main part of
the thing. So yeah, so that's super

109
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
exciting when that When that happens a
little nervous, but I tested the code as

110
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
much as I could and it seems to be working
So I mean, it's a good thing about being

111
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
in a controlled environment like a school,
you know, if it breaks You know what's

112
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
gonna happen. You don't have like
investors coming at you yelling at you. So

113
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
you just I don't know and say sorry guys
We're working on fixing it and then you

114
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
fix it So there is that leisure that you
have when you're doing something like an

115
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
academic thing like that

116
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Yeah, so I think such environments are
well experimentation friendly, right, by

117
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:33,000
definition. Also, so, well, no issue,
right, if something would be buggy. Well,

118
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:40,000
it's quite exciting. I mean, so finally,
Ergo is going to real world, which is more

119
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:47,000
important than even more important than
just, you know, games and, well,

120
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:54,000
blockchains and boxes like, I don't know,
like having DeFi applications disconnected

121
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:01,000
from the real world, right? Well, finally,
we have, you know, honey been sold on

122
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Ergo, and Macbooks, and now also students'
currency and so on. So, yeah, that's a

123
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:15,000
very important step forward.

124
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
And I think I mentioned this maybe in
Sigmanauts meeting, because I don't think

125
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I was in the AMA last week, but the really
cool thing about MewFinance is seller

126
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
protection, right? Right now, you know you
read horror stories about eBay where the

127
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,000
the buyer gets an item and they're like
Oh, it's not the right one or I don't like

128
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
it They send a bad one back eBay sides on
the case of the buyer because they don't

129
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,000
want to scare away the buyers, right?
There's always some seller to come so it's

130
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,000
a buyer's you don't want to scare away so
with MewFinance, it's a combination of

131
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Trust I guess but what's the word I'm
looking for? Reputation, right? So if

132
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Sigma Shop starts screwing people over,
we're done. You know, that's all we have

133
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,000
is our reputation. And then as a seller
too, it's amazing that the money comes in

134
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,000
directly to our wallet and I don't have to
worry about a bank clawing it back or eBay

135
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,000
clawing it back because somebody bitches
kind of thing. So, it's a great

136
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
combination of reputation of the seller
and the seller actually providing and

137
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,000
feeling safe that the money's there and
it's not going to be clawed back. So, I

138
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,000
think it's better than eBay in that
aspect. So, I encourage everybody, if you

139
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
have stuff, anything, stuff you're not
using, stuff you want to get rid of, see

140
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,000
if the Sigmanauts, if you can't get a
store yourself on MewFinance, see if the

141
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Sigmanauts will co-sign. Yeah, that's the
word for it. Consigned there we go. It's

142
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,000
spelled similarly Consign it for you. So
you'd essentially just ship it to us We'd

143
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,000
look it over make sure it's okay and then
post it for you at your price Take a

144
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
little bit off the top, of course for a
service and do it there. So please I mean,

145
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I'm sure the stuff you guys are sitting
around on like look at this Do you know

146
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,000
what this is MG pai I Don't know looks
like a plastic BRICK to me.

147
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Alright, let's see. Alright, so Andy says
that we should get some questions in the

148
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,000
old question chat and then he's gonna
refresh it so that we see the new chat. So

149
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,000
let me look through the old questions.
Let's see if it'll work. Oh, it still

150
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,000
works. Alright, here we go. I don't think
any of it, well, mgPai should know this.

151
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,000
When Palm Token will be available to trade
on DEX, MG?

152
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:57,000
So, I mean, of course I can't reveal
anything but I can say that there is a

153
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:04,000
public sale happening I think next week or
so something like that so I think in I

154
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:11,000
mean if you want like all this like type
of alpha knowledge right you got to join

155
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:18,000
the spaces that Palm hosts right we do
spaces on X quite frequently so I believe

156
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:25,000
it was said in that space that Like within
a month or so, Palm should be available to

157
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:32,000
like freely trade some things along those
lines. But I can't give any accurate

158
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:39,000
details on that, but it is of course very
soon because the public sale is next week.

159
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Alrighty. Let's see. kushti, maybe this
one's for you. It doesn't make sense to

160
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,000
me. Do you have public block producer
calls? If so, when and where? Are they

161
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,000
speaking like just like phone calls or
calls like programming calls? API calls.

162
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Is that what it is?

163
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Or a block producer calls. What do they
mean?

164
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:22,000
probably actually mean like that like
phone like zoom calls meeting yeah yeah

165
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:30,000
yeah block producer but no we don't know
what does that mean it's like miners or

166
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:38,000
mining pools I don't even have contacts of
all the pools now so recently I've asked

167
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:46,000
qx() about one right Yeah, the biggest
one, actually. So, yeah, well, and about

168
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:54,000
getting them on the call, I mean, why?
Good luck finding them, I mean. Yes, so

169
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:02,000
some guys are pretty anonymous, and then
you have a way to make a call even. Yeah,

170
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:10,000
it is tough. Everyone is doing its own
business.

171
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Yep, we have about 50, 60 people
connected to the Sigmanauts mining pool.

172
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,000
And I'd say only a dozen or so are very
active and chatting, right? So the rest of

173
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,000
them prefer to stay in the shadows and
watch and continue to mine. So yeah, it

174
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,000
would be interesting. And that's just our
pool. That's just a Sigmanauts pool across

175
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,000
the board. I think it might be a little
interesting, that's for sure. Some sort of

176
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:40,000
block producer group. that has generally i
don't know i wonder that seems to organize

177
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,000
alex that seems against not against but
that seems anti what what it is i guess i

178
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,000
don't know interesting it would be
interesting yeah but also yeah i mean why

179
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,000
to do that even so yeah yeah what's the
incentive i mean i guess it'd be nice to

180
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,000
like when node updates come up alex so you
could like have a reminder hey guys update

181
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,000
your nodes and the mining core

182
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Yeah so currently well so last time we've
asked pools back in 2022 so yeah well

183
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:27,000
during 5.0 soft fork update right And
yeah, before it was NIPoPoWs merge sudden

184
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:36,000
hard fork and before it was EP27 soft
fork, right? So well, yeah, all those

185
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:45,000
updates were back in 2022. And yes, since
then, so well, I'm not in touch. Yeah, no,

186
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:54,000
no, not just me. So back then like half of
connections I was made by Joe probably so

187
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Yes since then so I I don't know even
which versions they're running Five or

188
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:12,000
somewhat probably but maybe five one zero
So, I don't even know, and also why. So,

189
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:21,000
well...

190
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:34,000
You know, speaking of mining, I do have a
question for kushti. So recently, I think

191
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:40,000
there was an issue on with nodes that if
you submit like a transaction right now,

192
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:46,000
it's not going to be included in the
current block, right? It always gets

193
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:52,000
included in like block N plus one or N
plus two or so on. Right. And there's an

194
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:58,000
issue that's fixed. That's the issue has
been fixed. What are your plans on merging

195
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:04,000
that into the main node and having the
pools all update their versions? Why are

196
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:10,000
we holding up on that?

197
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Well, one of the reasons is because you
and the other guys are not reviewing PRs

198
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
even earlier.

199
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Oh, burn!

200
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:28,000
So, yeah, I mean, do your job for V3. We
don't do releases. So, I'm not, you know,

201
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:38,000
like... Yeah, I can't do releases without
reviews. I mean, it's... So, you're

202
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:48,000
waiting on a review for that? Not for
that, just for previous releases. The plan

203
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:58,000
for the next one is to include fixes for
indexer. There are, I believe, a couple of

204
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:08,000
other PRs for next miner releases. And
then we can do that release with only PR,

205
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:18,000
which is about regenerating block
candidates. So the plan is to have only

206
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:28,000
this PR and inform mining pools about that
and all that stuff. Before that we need to

207
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:38,000
release other minor versions, so there is
some logic in development as well. Okay.

208
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Yeah, it's at all. It's then depends on
the reviewers like you basically.

209
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Yeah. So we should say, yeah, we should,
I should certainly prioritize reviewing

210
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,000
that I think, and whatever is sequential.
So I guess before that, because this will

211
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:06,000
be a huge like quality update, right? When
transacting on Ergo, it'll appear that

212
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,000
your transactions confirm much faster,
right? Because it will get immediately

213
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:16,000
included in the current block or the next
block instead of like block plus current

214
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,000
block plus two. So this will be a huge
update to everyone and this is a very

215
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,000
low-hanging fruit so we should certainly
attack this.

216
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Yeah, I mean a lot of things to be
checked also so this should be a

217
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:41,000
well-dedicated release. And yeah, well,
there is some logic, you know, in

218
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:47,000
development, so there are other things,
and then, yeah, we are blocked by, well,

219
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:53,000
absence of reviews at the moment.

220
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,000
In the new chat, guys, we've got a whole
minor chat going. They're talking about

221
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,000
cards and clocking and locking the memory.
Super cool. Super cool to watch. Alright,

222
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:08,000
let's see. We've got the big 3d says any
updates. I'm cracking exchange listings

223
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,000
and you know what the big 3d when I
reached out to mark mark greenberg our

224
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:18,000
buddy our ergo holder mark greenberg now
after he left he said he was going to try

225
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,000
to talk to dave brumfeld if it's dm
brumfeld i believe right crypto dave to

226
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:28,000
open up his dm so we could chat with him
and crypto dave hasn't yet so while you

227
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,000
guys were arguing with each other and
kushti was insulting you mg pai for not

228
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:38,000
doing reviews I pinged Mark again and
asked him, I told him I hope his new job

229
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,000
is treating him well and it's everything
he's ever dreamed of. And then I reminded

230
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:48,000
him about getting Brumfield to open his
DMs or chat with us. So hopefully we get

231
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:53,000
some word there and we can... Continue
that conversation get it kicked up again

232
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,000
and again Kraken listing is for access
right? We're not looking for we all know

233
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,000
how disappointing it is Most crypto
exchange launches right everybody gets

234
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:08,000
this big high bow the price is gonna moon
and that kind of thing so Everybody should

235
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:13,000
look at this kind of stuff as you know,
we're getting more access for US customers

236
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:18,000
for people who are to use Kraken
specifically To ERG, which is very great

237
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,000
spreading liquidity across those
exchanges. So super cool If he does that.

238
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:28,000
All right, let's see sub-blocks kushti
they want to know how sub-blocks are going

239
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Yeah, so

240
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Well, there is progress, right? Polishing
EAP still needs to include arguments about

241
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:02,000
security, right? Because, well, it
shouldn't be done like, I don't know, most

242
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:10,000
of protocol updates in the space, like, I
don't know, developers are doing something

243
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:18,000
And then, well, it's just getting shielded
by marketing folks, right? And that's it.

244
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:26,000
So there is need for security arguments
for treatment. So, well, we will check

245
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:34,000
papers on similar constructions. like
Tailstorm, but Prism probably, so Prism

246
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:42,000
has somewhat satisfying, well, security
arguments. Then, well, then, yeah, writing

247
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:50,000
the code, so, yeah, well, hopefully, well,
so currently I have already local miners

248
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:58,000
generating sub-blocks, input blocks, but
the contents are not valid, just basically

249
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:06,000
empty. So now the idea is to properly
spread transactions according to the EEP

250
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:14,000
draft and properly form I needed fields
and well there are a lot of things to get

251
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:22,000
done on the way especially about well
updating proofs well state transformation

252
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:30,000
proofs which is actually one of the
reasons why well transaction is not

253
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:38,000
getting into a block immediately so well
that there is need to check state

254
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:46,000
transformation proof. In ergo we have a
lot of modes of operation, so it's

255
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:54,000
possible to run what like 90 percent of
people are doing, so they're just running

256
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:02,000
with default settings and not which is
holding QTXO set, right? But also Ergo is

257
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:10,000
supporting stateless clients, right? It
was the first cryptocurrency with

258
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:18,000
stateless clients. And actually, still, I
believe the only one where stateless

259
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:26,000
clients are based on just hash-based
cryptography. So not any MoonMath

260
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:34,000
cryptography. So, well, just very simple
actually, hash-based cryptography. And

261
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:42,000
then, yeah, it's also then possible to use
NIPoPoWs. right and so on and well yeah

262
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:50,000
it's a lot of complexity so well we are
discussing possible nodes not alternative

263
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:58,000
node implementation maybe in Rust right in
coming years as well Sigma Rust is making

264
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:06,000
progress but then yeah well with all those
mods it would be quite tricky so maybe it

265
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:14,000
makes sense to do some I don't know
dedicated clients just like maybe nippo

266
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:22,000
pole based for status right suitable maybe
for very limited environments maybe where

267
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:30,000
internet connection is well near to none
Going back to sub-blocks, we are now going

268
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:38,000
to handle state transformation proofs and
transactions and all that stuff. In case

269
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:46,000
of luck, maybe next week there will be a
local DevNet on my machine with all those

270
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:54,000
things done with transactions properly
going into input blocks. And then, yeah,

271
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:02,000
well, there is need for polishing and then
a lot of details to be considered like

272
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:10,000
updating how to update stratum proxy for
miners, right, if we are talking about

273
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:18,000
external miner, how to update APYs, right,
how to add support to applications and so

274
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:26,000
on. Yeah, a lot of tricky details. How to
do pruning, by the way, because, well,

275
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:34,000
with more transactions going into blocks,
maybe, right, there is need for more

276
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:42,000
aggressive pruning. Yeah, it also depends.
So I'm now asking application developers

277
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:50,000
like qx(), for example. So what are their
plans in regards with using Corollaps and

278
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:58,000
so on, right? Because, well, based on that
we may will handle some things ahead of

279
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:06,000
time, like roll-up constructions. So it
could be done much better than done in

280
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Ethereum, for example, in regards with
storing blobs and pruning them and so on.

281
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:22,000
So yeah, a lot of tricky details and then
Some things also to be considered for the

282
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:30,000
future, such as supporting
sub-block-based, input-block-based

283
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:38,000
sidechains. How you can make a sidechain
progressing sub-block-by-sub-block

284
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:46,000
basically. which is probably requiring to
add something to validation context, but

285
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:54,000
that's pretty tricky, but yeah, there are
some things too. to be considered here,

286
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:02,000
maybe even in a velvet-forking way after,
well, sub-block deployment. But then there

287
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:10,000
is also question how to do that right in
so soft-forkish way. So yeah, a lot of

288
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:18,000
questions. So yeah, I'm continuing to
write down details and well, some plans

289
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:26,000
for our future into EP. And yeah, the
court is progressing.

290
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:20,000
While you guys were chatting, I checked
out my Rosenwatcher and I try to check out

291
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:25,000
my watcher once a week to make sure it's
running. I have a watcher on Bitcoin, ERG,

292
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:30,000
BTC, and Ethereum. But mainly my ERG ones
are Bezias. And every week it's between

293
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:35,000
150, 250, Rosen which means that I'm
making 12 to 15 ERG per week Running this

294
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Ergo watcher. It's it's absolutely
amazing. I mean, that's hey, you don't

295
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:45,000
even do anything Well, come on. I'm doing
something MG by it's some work running

296
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:50,000
this passive Yeah, so it's super super
awesome, you know just make sure to reboot

297
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:55,000
it once in a while that it's running and
Make sure the node it's connected to is

298
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:00,000
functioning and good. So yeah, I mean it's
it's it's it's amazing. Yep. Yep. So I

299
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,000
encourage people who aren't doing this to
do this because I mean, we're in the

300
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:10,000
infancy of this thing and I'm doing 12 ERG
a month a week. Sorry.

301
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,000
I mean, if you're not selling Rosen,
right, there's always upside.

302
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Yeah, yeah. No, I've already taken my
last big batch. I just added it to a new

303
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:34,000
permit. Once it got to 3000, I just pumped
it back into one of them. And this is only

304
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:39,000
on the Ergo side. I am only running Ten
permits on the Ergo side. Yeah, and the

305
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:44,000
most at any time And this is when the
bridge was waiting for funds to transfer.

306
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:49,000
I think I had five or six permits out So I
haven't maxed out on that yet. So so yeah

307
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:54,000
encourage people who have rosen sitting
there and aren't doing anything with it

308
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Please, you know spin up a watcher. We
have videos from version one That are

309
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:04,000
pretty similar to what it is now to set it
up. The instructions are pretty good tried

310
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:09,000
and tested Give it a go.

311
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:19,000
All right and by the way about input
blocks and well some additional source of

312
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:28,000
income. So currently well miners are
packing right input blocks but what I'm

313
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:37,000
thinking about maybe to add to outline how
it could be done in future so maybe in

314
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:46,000
future like everyone can do an input block
basically right along with zero knowledge

315
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:55,000
proof of its validity and sent to a miner
for inclusion right and then a miner It

316
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:04,000
needs to just check proof and includes
everything. And then you can basically

317
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:13,000
earn from generating zero-knowledge
proofs.

318
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,000
I like that. I think you can encourage
people to run node, right? Based on that

319
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,000
idea, because you can just have like the
node software itself be the one to

320
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,000
generate. Right.

321
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:32,000
So there are lots of tricky details here
for sure. And well, I'm well tracking the

322
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:38,000
state of zero knowledge proof. So maybe
it's still too early, right? especially if

323
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:44,000
we are talking about, well, retail
capabilities to generate proofs. But,

324
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:50,000
yeah, well, it's progressing, so maybe in
a few years, yeah, that would become

325
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:56,000
reality.

326
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Yeah, so I guess basically the idea is
you get paid to run a node and the

327
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,000
possibility of that, so... That would be
quite, that would be pretty amazing. It's

328
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,000
not very much seen in the crypto space,
right? To get paid to run nodes, right? So

329
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,000
that would be pretty nice.

330
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Yeah, because it's quite tricky to do,
right? Well, yeah. If you are willing to

331
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:31,000
pay for a node, then this node should
produce some verifiable work. Otherwise,

332
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:39,000
it probably would be always not resistant
to civil attacks, so you can always

333
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:47,000
generate a lot of nodes. Yeah, do
inflation basically just by spamming a

334
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:55,000
network with nodes created just in order
to get tokens, right? Yes. That's actually

335
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:03,000
how the first proof-of-work currency
failed, I believe. I forgot its name. One

336
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:11,000
created by Hal Finny before Bitcoin, like
PoW Cash or something like that. So yeah,

337
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:19,000
the problem. There was basically inflation
when people... So there was no dynamic

338
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:27,000
difficulty and so on, so people just
created a lot of notes and the cost of

339
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:35,000
inflation. And then a few years after,
Bitcoin appeared.

340
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Could you just CPU mine the node and post
that proof in a block so it shows you're

341
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:53,000
actually running and using the node? I
mean it won't do any good, you know, CPU

342
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:58,000
mining, but you could govern it to do 10%
of your CPU, show that it's CPU mining

343
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:03,000
your node and put that proof on the chain.
That would be proof that the node's

344
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:08,000
running, it's up to date, and somebody's
active on it kind of thing, no?

345
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Yeah, actually, there are ideas like to
have a double proof-of-work system, right?

346
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:25,000
So first, a kind of actors doing
proof-of-work to pack transactions into...

347
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:33,000
it's called FRUITS. And then miners,
second-class miners are packing fruits

348
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:41,000
into blocks, right? So that's quite old
idea from 2016, I believe. 17 fruits

349
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:49,000
chain. And yeah, I'm not sure about
implementations, actually. Well, to the

350
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:57,000
best of my knowledge, midnight plans at
some point, but I'm not sure about now.

351
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:05,000
And yeah, so that's possible. But then,
yeah, so you have just competition in two

352
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:13,000
dimensions, right? So, well, in regards
with one kind of proof work and another

353
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:21,000
kind of proof work. And it's quite hard to
predict, well, how secure it would be, but

354
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:29,000
yeah, well, let's see, so maybe just,
well, approves generation. Well, this kind

355
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:37,000
of proof-of-work, right, kind of work
would be quite good for just, well,

356
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:45,000
forming, well, fruits, right, so, well,
parts of blocks with transactions, the

357
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:53,000
input blocks here in Ergo, basically. And
then, yes, the second-class managers are

358
00:37:53,000 --> 00:38:01,000
doing kind of real proof-of-work, how to
like us. Iterations, yeah, well, they're

359
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:09,000
packing into blocks, right? They are
confirming them by using, yeah, ordering

360
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:17,000
blocks. So, like, for four blocks now.

361
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:24,000
All right, guys, we got a good question
here. From Augustus Kent, how easy would

362
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:29,000
it be for Bitcoin to copy Ergo's unique
features if they are proven to be needed,

363
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:34,000
i.e. could BTC just soft fork and add
storage rent?

364
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Yeah, so I think, well, the chance is
about zero, right? So one of the lowest

365
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:50,000
hanging fruits which discussed in Bitcoin
community since 2000, Oh, 11, probably 12.

366
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Yeah, so it is about, well, including UTXO
set confirmations. It was called in the

367
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Bitcoin community to block headers, right,
somehow, or maybe other parts of the

368
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:14,000
block, so it's possible to commit maybe
even via Coinbase transactions, so not

369
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:22,000
breaking the protocol. Just soft forkish
or maybe even a little bit forkish way,

370
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:30,000
but yeah, it's still not there. But, you
know, well, it would be highly beneficial

371
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:38,000
for like hundreds of protocols. So like,
well, SPV wallets, well, light clients,

372
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:46,000
trustless relays, cross chains. And so on.
Well, sidechains. So a lot of

373
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:54,000
applications, but it's still not there. So
about, well, introducing storage rent. So

374
00:39:54,000 --> 00:40:02,000
I see there are now a lot of discussions
in the Bitcoin community in regards with

375
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:10,000
what to do with security budget, which is
shrinking, right? And, yeah, well, the

376
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:18,000
most popular proposals are about
introducing storage rent or, well,

377
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:26,000
introducing Taylor Mission somehow. But,
yeah, I'm not sure it's possible to, well,

378
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:34,000
updates the bitcoin protocol here as well
right so probably that would create a lot

379
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:42,000
of drama on the way maybe maybe more split
so maybe we will see bitcoin demurrage and

380
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:50,000
then what else bitcoin telemission and
then yeah bitcoin classic i don't know

381
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:58,000
bitcoin core maybe let's see let's see but
yeah in general updating anything in the

382
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Bitcoin protocol since like 2011 is nearly
impossible so there were actually quite

383
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:14,000
dramatic changes in early years like 2009,
10 maybe 11 like early 11 but yes since

384
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:22,000
then it's It's about soft forks only. And
yeah, well, soft forks of some specific

385
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:30,000
kind. So they are now, well, spending a
few years discussing whether it's worth to

386
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:38,000
reintroduce opcodes switched off back in
2010, right? So, well, it was easy to

387
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:46,000
switch them off, but to switch it on, just
one of them, which is well useful for,

388
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:54,000
needed for some roll-ups and so on,
roll-up constructions and so on. So yeah,

389
00:41:54,000 --> 00:42:02,000
that's big drama, even that, even getting
back one opcode switched off temporarily,

390
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:10,000
actually back in 2010.

391
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Have you guys, well we're getting near
time, but a couple more things. Have you

392
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,000
guys seen the C8's new project that he
whipped together?

393
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Yeah, yeah, so... Just today I've tried
to create another row of transactions made

394
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:54,000
as quickly as possible. That was actually
quite an awesome experience. All of them

395
00:42:54,000 --> 00:43:02,000
today are finished in a block.

396
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:10,000
That's awesome. So that's for people that
don't know, I retweeted it. I retweeted it

397
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:17,000
on the main account, C8sPost. He's running
a mint competition on his new ergify.xyz

398
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:24,000
site. So if you guys are up for playing
with SigmaRSV or SigmaUSD and converting

399
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:31,000
back and forth, that is a site for you.
It's with a new Nautilus. You can chain

400
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:38,000
those puppies and spam it, and it's pretty
neat. Give that a try see it's really good

401
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:45,000
at pulling those things out and getting
them up I think it's on alpha version 10

402
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:52,000
already and when I looked a couple days
ago, it's like an alpha version 3 or

403
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:59,000
something So he's really crushing out
those updates I Think that's it guys. It's

404
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:06,000
10 on 7 You want to call it Right Yeah,
who's gonna call it MG pie look I have an

405
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Ergo hat now yeah Maybe I'll sell this one
Great All right. Thanks everybody for

406
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:20,000
joining MG pie. It was amazing to see you
back behind the camera again kushti

407
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Awesome as always Thanks, all right Yeah,
thank you guys.

408
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:35,000
It was my pleasure to be here again and
yeah good quest as usually. So, see you

409
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:42,000
maybe next week or maybe there are other
folks. Sounds good folks. Yeah, there are

410
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:49,000
other folks waiting maybe for, for, for
being here. Let's see.

411
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,000
That'd be nice. Great. Ciao everybody.
