1
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Hey, everybody.

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
My name is qx().

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I'm a Sigmanauts.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And with me, I have Dan Friedman and he's
a Sigma.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
It is.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Oh, Dan Friedman.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Oh, he switched us.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
That was really trippy.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
That was super trippy.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Wow.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
You missed that one to be Dan Friedman
for a minute.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Darn it.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Yeah, sorry, you're not handsome enough
to be, I'm not. I had a good, I had a

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
couple good lines too I was gonna spout
out that like I am Dan Friedman and I'm

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
here to bring you just an amazing, amazing
AMA of stuff for Ergo. So with me I got,

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
well, I got qx() and his three favorite
boxes to his right.

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Oh, yeah, those are great. That's a
classic example of project managers being

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
awful.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Yeah, it's a classic example of you not
putting your shit away.

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
No, no, no. That's out on purpose to
remind me to take it to New York City when

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I go there. Huge project that we did. A
lot of stuff. And whoever was... I don't

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
want to blame the architect designer.
Maybe the builders. I don't know.

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Yeah, you blame the architect designer.

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Whoever was putting the floor box plates
into the boxes that are showing behind the

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
stage didn't make sure they were going to
fit. So it's easier for me to just buy

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
them and install them myself. But classic
kind of little punchlist stuff that is

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
$3,000 a fix or $200 for me to buy it and
take it down there and fix it kind of

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
thing.

29
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I have no idea what you're talking about,
but... Well, it's okay.

30
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
How's your week been, Dan? You had a
successful Zengate liquidity launch,

31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
right?

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,000
We did a thing. Yeah, we did a thing. We
launched a token for those of you who have

33
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
been living under a rock. Yeah, Palm is
out and it is live. And yes, sir, it used

34
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
none other than Rosen Bridge to go
multi-chain at launch. That's amazing,

35
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,000
sir. Which was really cool. It worked
fantastically.

36
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,000
So the thing that I was wondering about
is how would arbitrage work between the

37
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,000
two chains. And it actually worked really
well. The price is pretty much the same on

38
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,000
both sides, on the Binance side as well as
the Cardano side. Staking is working

39
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,000
really well on both sides. Yeah, just
everything really worked out well. I mean,

40
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Rosen worked fantastically. And so like I
said, I'm very happy to be the first

41
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,000
official multi-chain token launch using
Rosen. So kudos to the Rosen team. And

42
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,000
yeah, it was no complaints yet.

43
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Give it time, right?

44
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Yeah. Give it time. We'll find something.

45
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
So it currently, can you do more stuff?
Like let's say people only really... Let's

46
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
say people enter from the Binance side. Is
there a benefit for them to move over to

47
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
the Cardano side to have more utility with
your token at this point or vice versa?

48
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
At this point, well, first of all,
there's more support on the Cardano side.

49
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
So we just have more support for more
wallets. So on the Binance side, I think

50
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
we got Metamask support. But, you know, it
works weird because you would think that

51
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Binance works with Binance, but it
actually works with Ethereum. And it

52
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
always confused the shit out of me, like,
why is that? You know, I mean, I know why

53
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
that is, but I'm just saying it's kind of
like a really, really weird UX, qx().

54
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I thought Binance Chain was based off
Ethereum, no?

55
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
It's based off Ethereum, but for example,
if you're using a ledger with Binance, you

56
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
have to turn on the Ethereum app. Yeah.
Not the Binance app, although they have a

57
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Binance app, but that's just for holding
tokens. For you to do any kind of smart

58
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
contract stuff, you have to turn on the
Ethereum app.

59
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Oh, interesting.

60
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
It's just weird UX. It's just really
weird UX. So yeah, so on the Cardano side,

61
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
you have a lot more... Well, we also have
the community that's mostly on the Cardano

62
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
side. So there's that. But, but really we
try to kind of, you know, spread utility

63
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
evenly. So you do, you can, and you're
supposed to be able to do the same stuff

64
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
on both chains.

65
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
And so this is what I was talking about
in the previous AMA, which, why we can't

66
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
just kind of like, you know, flip a switch
and get Ergo support is because it has to

67
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
be the exact same stuff on Ergo. And we
will eventually, we'll put assets on Ergo,

68
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
but we can't just, you know, we can't just
like move it over. It's not as simple as

69
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
that. If we move it over and it doesn't
have the same support, the same utility,

70
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
then it's a problem. It's a problem for
regulators.

71
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
But on the Cardano side, you've got more
wallet support. You have more community

72
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
support.

73
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Are you still giving it away for a stake
pool rewards as well?

74
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Yeah. Yeah. And, and, and exactly. Yeah.
So, so on the Cardano side, you still have

75
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
the ISPO, which is still happening. Right.
So, we don't have that on the Binance

76
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
side, because there's no stake pools in
them. Well, there are stake pools, but

77
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
they don't work the same way as, as they
do on the Cardano side. So, yeah.

78
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
On the Ergo side, would you use the code
from ErgoPad eventually and refactor that

79
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
or start from scratch for staking?

80
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I mean, the thing is that I actually
talked to Luca about that and I've talked

81
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,000
to Luca about the smart contracts on
Paideia or Paideia or whatever but do we

82
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,000
however you say it in a really weird you
know upstate New York accent Paideia yeah

83
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Paideia whatever papa papa papa deal
papaya. Their smart contracts for staking

84
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,000
don't do the same stuff. So it's different
type of staking. We have liquid staking,

85
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:08,000
which works differently, or I'm sorry, not
liquid, dynamic staking, which works

86
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:14,000
differently. And so for us to actually
utilize those contracts, I mean, it was

87
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,000
really, we'd probably just have to do our
own thing over.

88
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
So explain the dynamic staking. I miss
that.

89
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Yeah, so basically, it's dynamic. It's
unlocked staking, but it is divided by, I

90
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:40,000
think, what is it, every seven days. And
so it's not delegated staking. where your

91
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:47,000
tokens are locked into staking, but it can
be unlocked at any time. So there is no

92
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:54,000
wait like you would on an exchange or
something. Sometimes if you stake on, say,

93
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Coinbase, they call it staking, but they
actually lock your tokens up if you stake

94
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Cardano tokens. With our staking, although
the tokens are locked up for staking, you

95
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:15,000
can unlock them at any time instantly. And
the only thing is, if you are before the

96
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:22,000
end of that epoch, or the staking epoch,
you just don't get those rewards. You have

97
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:29,000
to stay to the end of the epoch. But other
than that, it's dynamic staking.

98
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:41,000
So it's like ErgoPad, but you'd have to
refactor in the epoch.

99
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,000
There's actually more to it. That's a
super simple way of explaining it, but

100
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,000
there's more to it. Actually, you can
check it out. If you go on the Palm

101
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Economy socials, there are links and also
the Discord as well. Actually, Discord is

102
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
probably better because I think Palm
Economy would have to find the tweets

103
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,000
where we put in the links for the portals.
But on the Discord, you have links readily

104
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,000
available, and you can check it out.

105
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:22,000
We have a staking calculator tool that
shows you APY and APR with a little

106
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:30,000
sliding tool to show you if you stake this
much, how much it would come out as, and

107
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:38,000
so on and so forth. And so we already have
something like, I think, like 250 million

108
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:46,000
palms staked. So at current prices, that's
about a quarter of a million dollars

109
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:54,000
already staked in the first couple of
days. A little more, more like $300,000

110
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:02,000
worth of palms staked. And more and more
is growing.

111
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
What actually I spoke to one of our in
fact our first. Token holder from way

112
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,000
back. You know, and he came in at the
angel round. So these guys are, you know,

113
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
like these guys are the whales that came
in at the angel round. And he's basically

114
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
saying that I'm not touching this stuff.
Well, he's got really long vesting, but

115
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,000
also the stuff that he does have right
now, it's still, you know, the stuff that

116
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,000
unlocked on TGE is also, you know,
considering what they got into, at what

117
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
price point they get into is pretty
considerable. But he says he's not

118
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
touching it. You know, he's just staking
it. And everybody just loves it. Everybody

119
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,000
loves the staking. And it's really good.
It's a great design. The UI is really

120
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
good. UX is great. We're supporting, I
think, all the major wallets right now.

121
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
They just enabled support for Eternal. So,
yeah, the rollout has been actually pretty

122
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,000
smooth.

123
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
It's considering what we had to do. Yeah,
I'm really happy with everything. And of

124
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
course, it wasn't just like a flip of a
switch type of thing. We had to make sure

125
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
that market making is done properly. we
have to make sure that liquidity is

126
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
supplied properly, just to make sure that
everything is stable, because a lot of

127
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
times Cardano projects, as well as Ergo
projects, they'll launch a token, which is

128
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
fine, and they just launch it into the
wild, and bam, there you go, and they

129
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
don't really do anything to it.

130
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:50,000
And of course, on the Ergo side, it's not
as crucial, I guess, to have a market

131
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:57,000
maker because you just don't have that
huge amount of volume that they can do

132
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:04,000
anything with. On Cardano, you still don't
have volumes like you would on the

133
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Ethereum's of the world when you're
launching an asset. But it's still,

134
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:18,000
obviously, I think we're getting something
like about $150,000 worth of volume a day.

135
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:25,000
There is probably about $350,000 worth of
liquidity backing the token on the Cardano

136
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:32,000
side, I think maybe like 150 on the
Binance side.

137
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
You have to make sure that all these
things are really worked out to make sure

138
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
that nothing crazy happens to it. like,
you know, that there's support for people

139
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
that, you know, they want to do what they
want to do. You know, they get your token,

140
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
you do what you want to do with it, but it
doesn't, you know, it doesn't like,

141
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
doesn't beat the system up too much. You
don't have too much, too many huge swings

142
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
that really kind of freak people out.

143
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:00,000
So yeah, it's, it's, it's been, I mean,
we're still in the middle of it. You know,

144
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:06,000
everybody's probably had like four hours
of sleep at the most. the past few days,

145
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:12,000
including me. And you see I am wearing my
Palm T-shirt today. And yeah, I actually,

146
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I was so tired today that, and pretending
that I'm not, that when I was at the

147
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:24,000
office, I was wearing this T-shirt. And so
I have two types of these T-shirts. One is

148
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:30,000
just got the Palm logo right here. And the
other one's got the Palm logo and it's got

149
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:36,000
a thing on the back says, keep Palm and
tokenize RWAs.

150
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,000
And so Maureen and Luca were at a dev
meeting today. They have these daily dev

151
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,000
stand-ups. And so we have this, we have a
conference room at the office, which is,

152
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,000
it's like a big glass wall, but it's its
own room. And so they're in the room and

153
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I'm about to leave the office to go and
take care of some errands. And I'm just

154
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,000
walking out and they're all at the at the
big TV talking to our head of development

155
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,000
and I'm just, I'm kind of standing there
and I'm saying bye to everybody and I

156
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,000
pointed the back of the shirt and I'm
like, check it out, check it out.

157
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Yeah, see? Everybody's looking at me
weird and then I want to walk outside, I

158
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:26,000
realized that I wasn't wearing the shirt
with the stuff on the back. So I was just

159
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:32,000
basically pointing at the blank blackness
of my t-shirt. And people thinking like,

160
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:38,000
what the fuck is the deal with this guy?
And of course he played it off like, oh,

161
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:44,000
it's okay, Dan, it's okay. And I'm like,
aw. Like here you are 11 o'clock at night

162
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Japan time Coming out for the video Dan
for the AMA look at you Sacrificing I'm

163
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:56,000
not probably gonna sleep till about 2 a.m.
Because there's a million million other

164
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:02,000
things to do but yes That was fun pointing
at a blank t-shirt And yeah, the That's

165
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:08,000
you know That's that that's the kitten
caboodle right there

166
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Well, that sounds like I'm excited for
the opportunity to see Palm come to Ergo

167
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:20,000
and utilize Paideia. That's, you know, I
think that's going to be really cool. Are

168
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:26,000
there any other? What's it called? What's
governance look like on the other chains?

169
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:32,000
With Paideia, you can essentially do
things with the treasury collectively as

170
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:38,000
you stake. Is that something that is
beneficial to Palm in the future?

171
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Yeah, absolutely, because what we have is
called the Palm DAO that we're actually

172
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,000
going to be rolling out really soon. And
yeah, I mean, we'd like to utilize tooling

173
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,000
for that on all chains on Ergo as well.
But we still need to kind of work it out.

174
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,000
We haven't really done tooling for it on
the Cardano side either. We have kind of,

175
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,000
we have things standing by, so it's not
going to be a big, like a big lift, a

176
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,000
heavy lift to get this thing going. And,
but really it's not just about the

177
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,000
tooling, it's about setting up the
ecosystem that supports this, you know,

178
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,000
and, and, and really setting up the
processes that, that, for, for proposals

179
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:26,000
and for voting and for, you know, all the
different iterations of it.

180
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:34,000
So, yes, so that's going to take a bit of
time. So first of all, the Palm DAO is

181
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:40,000
going to have the funding rounds. It's
sort of like catalyst, but it's going to

182
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:46,000
be a little bit more spontaneous.
Basically, people are going to be able to

183
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:52,000
submit a proposal eventually from the Ergo
side as well, right now from the Cardano

184
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:58,000
side and from the Binance side when we
build it out on there as well, and then

185
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:04,000
get it voted on by palm holders that are
part of the DAO. Just to that that if they

186
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:10,000
feel that this proposal is in line with
expanding of the ecosystem because

187
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:16,000
basically what it is is decentralized
business development. Right So that's what

188
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:22,000
it's saying for So how are you gonna
manage?

189
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I mean, how many how are you gonna manage
three different governance or how many

190
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
ever chains you expand to? How are you
gonna manage those kind of? governance

191
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
stroll ups from different things.

192
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
It's the same as it is with staking.
We're just going to have to build it out

193
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
the same on all the chains. You know, it's
going to have to be able to do the same

194
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
exact thing on all the chains. It's, it's,
it's not easy, but I mean that that's what

195
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
it is going multi-chain, you know? I mean,
you have to go multi-chain. If you want to

196
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
reach a wider audience, you have to be
able to do all this stuff.

197
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
You feel it's too, the UX would be too
difficult or not too difficult,

198
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
undesirable if you just force them to one
set of governance on a chain using Rosen.

199
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Like if you want to participate in
governance for Palm, then hop on Rosen and

200
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
stake in Paideia or something like that.
That'd be too much of a UX hassle for some

201
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
of these people.

202
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I think that we can actually do it the
other way. They can do it natively on the

203
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,000
chains that they're on and then we can use
a Rosen to kind of put it all into one

204
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,000
place when the time comes to utilize
things. You know, so maybe like the heart

205
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,000
of it can be on one chain. It could, for
example, be on Ergo and then all the all

206
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,000
the votes. They can come from all the
different chains, but they go through

207
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Rosen and they end up on Ergo. It doesn't
have to be, I mean, what I mean is the UX

208
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:48,000
has to be the same, right? But the
technology, I don't, well, at that point,

209
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I don't know because it's gonna be, yeah,
we have to kind of flesh that out a little

210
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:58,000
bit better because the DAO would actually
have to be incorporated, right? It would

211
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,000
have to actually be like an entity.

212
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
For it to work properly for it to work
properly on, you know, in, in, in, in real

213
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
life as well. So like these things that
are, like the contracts that are, that go

214
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
through the DAO were actually enforceable
by law, you know, because, you can't, you

215
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
know, you can't just like, trust me, bro,
this kind of stuff.

216
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Yeah.

217
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Classic. Trust me. I mean, yeah, these
are on-chain contracts, right? But you

218
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,000
have to be able to actually have a tool in
the real world to say that the on-chain

219
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,000
contract is enforceable, legally
enforceable. And actually, interestingly

220
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,000
enough, in Japan, they've developed
regulatory tooling like this. So we're

221
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:48,000
actually thinking about establishing the
DAO in Japan.

222
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:58,000
And so like I said, what we need to do is
we need to understand, it's not really

223
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:04,000
centralizing it, but keeping the heart of
the DAO on one chain, but then having

224
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:10,000
people from other chains coming in and
voting on the DAO through the bridge, what

225
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:16,000
do we have to have on other chains for it
to actually be compliant with regulations?

226
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I don't think we're going to have to build
it out on every single chain fully, but

227
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:28,000
there's going to be a minimum requirement
of what needs to happen in each chain for

228
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:34,000
it to work in a legal manner.

229
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I could see you using ROSEN somewhat
transparently in the background so that

230
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,000
the user interacts with some sort of
contract on the chain and their token is

231
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,000
transferred to a lock in ROSEN and
actually staked in. And then send back

232
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,000
with a batch of bots eventually Yeah, you
could yeah do that fairly transparently

233
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,000
not gonna be fast fast, but it would have
to be fast fast, you know, right?

234
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Right with Rosen right now, you know like
arbitrage takes like what did we do? We we

235
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:19,000
sent through the first batch of liquidity
going to pancake swap and That took a

236
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:25,000
couple of hours. It took a couple of hours
to go through, and so what if it did? For

237
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:31,000
the applications that we're utilizing them
for, that's fine. Finality, in this

238
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:37,000
particular case, is not that big of a
deal. For example, if you're using a DAO,

239
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:43,000
and say we build the DAO on Ergo, And then
you have Cardano, Ergo, and Binance and

240
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:49,000
whatever other chains we decided to add
support for vote in the DAO, right? I

241
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:55,000
mean, that vote doesn't have to happen
like this, right? It could take a little

242
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:01,000
bit of time for this whole thing to
propagate through Rosen. end up on Ergo

243
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:07,000
and then execute the smart contract on
Ergo, which will then basically tally up

244
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:13,000
and fix the votes and then execute
whatever conditions that contract has.

245
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Yeah, so it should be fine. I mean, as far
as tech goes, it's just all about

246
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:25,000
compliance-wise, like I said. It's a real
thing, right? It's not just like, well,

247
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:31,000
it's kind of cool. It's not just cool
tech. It's actually like a real entity.

248
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:37,000
It's going to be a real DAO. It's going to
be an incorporated entity. that is

249
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:43,000
compliant with regulation, that creates
contracts, on-chain contracts, that are

250
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:49,000
illegally enforceable. It's the big-pants
DAO of the deal right here.

251
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
All right. Well, that's exciting. Very
exciting, Dan, for so late at night.

252
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
You look really excited right now, qx().

253
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I am. It's my early morning, so I'm still
waking up. The crack of noon.

254
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Yeah. I know.

255
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Well, we got some big announcements so
far. We got... For the Sigmanauts mining

256
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,000
pool mark developed a really sexy
dashboard. It's called ergo miners.com And

257
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,000
it's very newish kind of looking so it it
really blends in even above and beyond

258
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,000
some of the other major players out there
with dashboards so if you're a miner or if

259
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,000
you're you know, somebody that just wants
to dabble in it, even if you're just a

260
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,000
gamer and you want to tune your computer
over at night time while you're not

261
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,000
playing a game or during the day while
you're working, check out the Dash. It's

262
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,000
pretty damn cool. It's quite the upgrade
from the old Dash and a huge upgrade from

263
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,000
the simple Dash that we started out with.
So yeah, bravo to Kudos to Mark for doing

264
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,000
that.

265
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:57,000
The other big news Dan is we have
launched the official date for the 2025

266
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Colorado Springs.

267
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Oh, yeah, I saw that I saw it.

268
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Yeah October 10th 11th and 12th. So the
main thing is the 11th people get there

269
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,000
the 10th We'll do something and then maybe
breakfast on the 12th when everybody goes

270
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:20,000
home but we crowds we're open sourcing it
just like the rest of Ergo so if you are

271
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,000
in the Ergo chats head to look for I guess
I'll pin it in a second but look for the

272
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:30,000
pin and there's a GitHub where the
information is for now and anybody can

273
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,000
fork and do pull requests on that sign up
page as well as the MD file explaining

274
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:40,000
everything to offer suggestions about what
to do, help with planning, all that kind

275
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:45,000
of stuff. So I encourage you to go over to
that on the GitHub and participate, sign

276
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:50,000
up, throw in some suggestions of what to
do if you know the area and that kind of

277
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:55,000
stuff. So I thought that was, Jemai had
the actual idea to put it on GitHub. So

278
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:00,000
that's what I did. I don't think there's
any other event or community that works

279
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,000
like that, so it's really fun to see.

280
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Let me see what we have already. We
have... Do I have any pull and over pull

281
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,000
requests yet? We have Just one pull
request I did last night for some

282
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,000
suggestions as well as a sign-up So head
over there and do it if you don't know how

283
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
to do a pull request You're welcome to
send me the data and I'll put it up there

284
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,000
for you to sign yourself up To pull up
your pants qx() that I'm not where I'm not

285
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
wearing any pants.

286
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Well, exactly. So just you know, like fix
that I

287
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Yeah, yeah. Oh, and by the way, by the
way, I mean, the, I see the question up

288
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:56,000
there from- What do we see?

289
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:02,000
From, where is it? High quality Ergo.
Uncle Dan, when six 50k worth of

290
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Palmarinos. We still haven't forgotten
about that. That is gonna come. What soon,

291
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:14,000
like I said, as soon as the Ergo support
is added- Checks in the mail.

292
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Yeah, the check's in the mail, except
it's like Pony Express. No, but seriously,

293
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:27,000
we're doing that. It has not been
forgotten.

294
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
We've talked about doing a roundtable on
Cardano, Dan, so we may come to you

295
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,000
knocking.

296
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:40,000
yeah well yeah make sure it's like really
a round table because people say it's a

297
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,000
round table but sometimes they're
triangular and it just really really fucks

298
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:50,000
with me it screws with my OCD so just make
sure it's like round round table

299
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Cute Dan cute.

300
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
I know it's adorable adorable.

301
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:03,000
All right, what else we have for
questions? Actually, we have let me see. I

302
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:10,000
think kushti had a sub-blocks update Let's
see

303
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,000
He's got some rough protocol working,
tested with two peers, still out of work

304
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,000
towards improving efficiency. So he's
still cranking away on sub-blocks, which

305
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,000
is great. And he's working on node 6.0. I
think he said last week, I don't know if I

306
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,000
made the AMA, that we have a full sync of
node 6 RC3, I believe, with mainnet. and I

307
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
think some others are starting to hop on
and test it. So that's looking great.

308
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:37,000
For anybody who's running a node right
now and you're running it on an SSD and

309
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:43,000
not some old platter drive or a small like
Raspberry Pi with an SSD, I encourage you

310
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:49,000
to go to 5.125 I think it is, the RocksDB
version. It's going to require a full node

311
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:55,000
resync but Wow, it's quite a bit faster. I
updated the secondary Ergo Explorer that I

312
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:01,000
run to that, and it's a big difference in
fetch times for mining wallets for smart

313
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:07,000
contracts and that kind of thing. They
usually take a second to load. So I

314
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:13,000
encourage you node runners, if you're
doing that, hop over to that. I don't know

315
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:19,000
if Satergo switched to rocks as a default,
but if he didn't, maybe it'd be great to

316
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:25,000
encourage him to give that option when you
spin up a database to see which one you

317
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:31,000
can use the same to. So yeah, that's
really cool.

318
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
What else? What do we got for questions,
Dan, the man?

319
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,000
all right what do we got for questions we
got we got we got we got we got a lot of

320
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,000
shit we got a lot of shit given us in the
channel so maybe yeah but i think it's i

321
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,000
think it's the same is the same guy you
know you are it's a big 3d yeah yeah

322
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,000
because he wants some attention here's
here's one maybe Sigmanauts will help with

323
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,000
the LP on the Ergo side just saying so

324
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,000
They wanted to make it clear that, you
know, it's really not that we are trying

325
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,000
to neglect Ergo. It's really not at all. I
mean, obviously we are bullish on Ergo,

326
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,000
but we build a bunch of the stuff on Ergo.
You know, it's still on Ergo. When the

327
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,000
protocol is on Ergo.

328
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
That's what you say, Dan.

329
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:26,000
We launched Ergo technology. So the only
thing, like I said, is we need to add

330
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:31,000
staking support, the same type of staking
support, on Ergo before we can actually

331
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:36,000
bridge the tokens and bring them to Ergo
through Rosen so that's the only thing and

332
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,000
at this point we just have quite a bit of
stuff that is being built out we're

333
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:46,000
actually expanding our our dev team to to
give us more support

334
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Oh, who are you stealing now? You already
have Louis Vatra. You stole the Louis

335
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Vatra.

336
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
We're done poaching. We're done poaching
you guys. Maybe. Maybe. I mean, if

337
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
somebody else comes around, we'll poach
them too. And they're going to be, you

338
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
know.

339
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:08,000
And now Crux is never going to get
finished, Louis Vatra.

340
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Yeah. Oh, wait.

341
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
I got to do my weekly shout out. Hey,
Marty, please fix the UI on the front of

342
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Paideia. You got some updates to do,
buddy. Hopefully he watches this week and

343
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
not last week. I don't know.

344
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:25,000
But already wherever you are, you know,
it's like an anchorman, you know, when he

345
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:30,000
like blows the horn and it just like, it's
hurt across the mountains. And then his

346
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:35,000
little dog is like bathing in like runs
out of the little, little creek in the

347
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:40,000
woods. Well, Marty is somewhere in like
in, in, in Canada bathing, you know, steam

348
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:45,000
hot ice bath. Yeah. Yeah. It's an ice
bath. And he, and he hears,

349
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Paideia Crew, assemble! Assemble! You
know, qx() saying that, you know, and he's

350
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:57,000
like, what? Oh my God, I have to fix the
tooling. Darn it. Eh? Because he's

351
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Canadian. Eh. A.

352
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Anyway, so they just, I know it's a bit
of a tangent, but yeah, that's how I saw

353
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,000
it in my mind when you gave the shout out.

354
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Yeah, so to get back to high quality
Ergo, yeah, like I said, we fully intend

355
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:20,000
to add, it's not a problem of the actual
liquidity being added to Ergo, right? It's

356
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:25,000
not a problem. It's like, oh, we just
don't have the money to put there. It's

357
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:30,000
really all about making sure that it's
compliant with regulation. That's all.

358
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:35,000
It's just for the protection of the
ecosystem.

359
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Well, maybe you can publish the
requirements, Dan, and then maybe some

360
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,000
developer would give a basic.

361
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:50,000
I'll have that conversation with Sam and
with Luca, well, Luca at the office

362
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:56,000
tomorrow. He's in Japan right now, hanging
out. Did you know that?

363
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Luca's in Japan?

364
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Yeah, Luca's been in Japan for weeks now.
He's going to be here for quite a while.

365
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,000
He's staying at the Zengate corporate
apartment right near the office and having

366
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,000
a time of his life. Very nice.

367
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Nice.

368
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Is mgPai joining you this summer as well?

369
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
So, yeah, we're going to try to get him
out as well. We're going to see. But yeah,

370
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,000
mgPai, well, he was out here for a couple
of months last year. Or I don't know.

371
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Well, it was quite a quite a while. I
forgot if it was a couple of months, but

372
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
it was quite a while.

373
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
It's probably got to come back and see
his kids. I mean, I'm sure they should be

374
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
born by now, right?

375
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
mgPai.

376
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Yeah.

377
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:43,000
All right. Well, some more questions,
Dan. It was a failed joke. It was a failed

378
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:48,000
joke that mgPai is living it up when he's
in Japan and then he's got to come back

379
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:53,000
and face his consequences.

380
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Oh,

381
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,000
All right.

382
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Let's, let's answer some of these
insults. I feel like I get an insult. So

383
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,000
this is great. We've got, all right, you
go first. I'll go the one after you. Palm

384
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,000
was promised four CEXes and a few days
later can't even get listed on coin gecko.

385
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,000
You take that. I'll take the next one.

386
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Yeah. So you know, it's like when, when
girls, you go out with girls and then, no,

387
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,000
you can't make that enough.

388
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,000
You can't make that analogy to the big
3d. He has no idea.

389
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Oh yeah. He does. I forgot. He, he, he
doesn't. Yeah. He, he, he, yeah. Yeah.

390
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I forgot. Okay.

391
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:46,000
We already did, but it's a secret and it
is a game like Magic the Gathering and

392
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:52,000
then you have to find the four CEXes and
collect them like the four rings of power

393
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:58,000
in Lord of the Rings. That might do it
down. Okay. Okay. There we go. There we

394
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:04,000
go. On a serious note, coin gecko should
be up any day now. We actually submitted

395
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:10,000
the application a couple of weeks ago, but
it takes a couple of weeks for them to get

396
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:16,000
it going. So that should be like,
literally I'm checking coin gecko to see

397
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:22,000
if they, you know, and I can't stay on
those listings just because

398
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:29,000
As soon as it happens, the bots come into
all the chats, they look for all the

399
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:33,000
admins, and you get about 50,000 DMs
saying, hey, I'm Billy Bob, but yes, let

400
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,000
me help you out.

401
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Let me help you. I am professional
administrator. I like administrating. I am

402
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,000
very impressed with your project.

403
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,000
I'm impressed with your project. They
don't even name the project.

404
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,000
They can't even get their bot to scrape
the name of the chat. I do get the bots on

405
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Telegram sometimes. They're like, wow,
Dan, I'm really impressed with the

406
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,000
performance on Ergo. I would like to help
you. I'm like, oh, thanks. That's really,

407
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,000
really nice of you, whoever you are.

408
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:14,000
And then sometimes they'll be like,
because I'm in Japan, so they'll just send

409
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:19,000
the Japan bots to me. But they're going to
be like really crappy Japan bots that

410
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:24,000
speak Japanese, not like the Japanese.
It's like broken shitty Japanese, but they

411
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,000
have a Japanese name. Like, yeah, yeah,
you're real, sure. Like, you know, the

412
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:34,000
first thing they always do is like, I am
blah, blah, blah, right? But in Japanese,

413
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:39,000
you hardly ever say like, I am blah, blah,
blah, because it's actually rude to keep

414
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:44,000
saying I am, right? Well, it's rude, but
it's also just like colloquially

415
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:49,000
incorrect. So the way you speak, you
don't, you seldom say I. I am, right? Like

416
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:54,000
that's actually, it's kind of like a joke
with the Japanese because like foreigners,

417
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:59,000
when they start just speaking Japanese, I
am in Japanese, watashiwa, you know, and

418
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:04,000
then like, like they always make like
behind, you know, like in, if you get

419
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:09,000
them, like in the right moment, they'll
make fun of foreigners speaking Japanese,

420
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:14,000
like watashiwa American desu, because
that's how the, that's how the foreigners,

421
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:19,000
you know, like Americans, American sound
to them.

422
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
But, Yeah, so they always come in and
they they start with watashi wa i'm like,

423
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
yep, you're Japanese definitely That's why
you start with I am which the Japanese

424
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,000
hardly ever start with or even ever start
with in that kind of conversation But

425
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
anyway, all right that fun fact for you
qx() next time you want to speak Japanese

426
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
I will do that.

427
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,000
All right next question big 3d qx() where
when Kraken wear Kraken cracking We're

428
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Kraken. All right, here we go. You ready?
Hopefully nobody from Kraken is watching

429
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:53,000
this. I'll give it to you guys straight.
All right. We have two pathways into

430
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Kraken.

431
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:06,000
potentially. The first pathway was a chat
joined by myself, Armeanio, kushti, I

432
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:12,000
think Cannon was there, with Dave. I think
it's Dave. Yeah, Dave Brumfield from

433
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Kraken. All right. It took a while to get
Dave to recognize that we didn't have a

434
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Ethereum contract ID, that we wanted token
on Ethereum, essentially. And once that

435
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:30,000
was established, there was some back and
forth about what would be best to list.

436
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:36,000
And that would be Rosen-ERG on Ethereum,
Rosen-ERG on Cardano, or ERG layer one.

437
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:42,000
It's obvious ERG layer one is a long ways
out because it's a lot of work for them

438
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:48,000
and there's not a lot of monetary reward
for them to do that work. So that is on

439
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:54,000
the very low end of the totem pole for
layer one. Rosen token though, Rosen ERG

440
00:37:54,000 --> 00:38:00,000
on Cardano Ethereum is going to be much
much easier to list. Rosen-ERG on Cardano

441
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:06,000
is probably the best option because we
have quite a bit of liquidity on the

442
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Cardano side and we have, what's it
called, more wallets. And compared to some

443
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:18,000
tokens they've listed recently, they
listed a wrap token, the flux wrap token,

444
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:24,000
we have more volume than they do on the
Cardano. Our Cardano volume on Rosen-ERG

445
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:30,000
is more than the Ethereum volume of Flux.
So we match that. But the thing that we

446
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:36,000
don't match is we don't match wallet
holders. And that's it, I guess. We don't

447
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:42,000
match wallet holders. Flux has 10,000
wallet holders on Ethereum. We have about

448
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:48,000
500 on Cardano.

449
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,000
The Sigmanauts are working on a
promotion, a faucet, and things like that

450
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:59,000
to get our wallet count up. Once we get
our wallet count way up, we will develop a

451
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:03,000
market-making plan and then approach Dan
again in that same chat, not Dan, Dave,

452
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,000
and let them know that we're here at what
they suggested our requirements should be.

453
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,000
And by then, too, they should be done
refactoring the Cardano update that

454
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:15,000
happened a couple weeks ago, or maybe a
month ago, Dan, whatever that big update

455
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,000
was that they were fumbling around with on
the Kraken side to get native tokens

456
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,000
ready. So that's one pathway.

457
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:35,000
The second pathway, and I have no NDA
signed, so I don't give a shit right now,

458
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:40,000
is a bribe. Literally, literally somebody
on the outside that has a connection with

459
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:45,000
the inside that would like a finder's fee
for getting us into a suggestion. And that

460
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:50,000
is around $50,000. And that doesn't
guarantee that we get in. We could be

461
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:55,000
exactly at the same place we are in the
chat with Dave and kushti where they're

462
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:00,000
saying, oh, we need your wallet count up
to this and that kind of thing. So that's

463
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:05,000
something that I'm not even looking to
pursue at this time because it could be a

464
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:10,000
huge waste of money at that point. And
it's so shitty too.

465
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,000
So there you go, there you have it. Those
are the plans. Sigmanauts are going to

466
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,000
come up with a way to engage the Cardano
community to get our wallet count up,

467
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,000
whether it means a lot of Ergonauts
porting over some ERGs to Cardano with us

468
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,000
helping pay fees maybe or some incentive
for that, as well as some other things

469
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,000
that I won't say on the recording. So
there you go, big 3D. All right, what else

470
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,000
we got, Dan?

471
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Oh, this is actually interesting. We were
just talking about this. Can Palm overtake

472
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Ergo in market cap soon? I think I was
talking to Luca about that today, maybe. I

473
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:59,000
don't know how I'd feel about that. I'm so
conflicted. I mean, yeah, it would be

474
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:05,000
great if Palm has the market cap or the
size, the ecosystem size that Ergo has.

475
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:11,000
but I want Ergo to be bigger. I don't know
which one is, which one like, you know

476
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:17,000
what I mean? Like there is no, they just
both feel kind of like I, yeah, I want it

477
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:23,000
to be as big as Ergo, or it would be
really cool if it was actually bigger than

478
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Ergo, but it wouldn't be also at the same
time. Because then why is Ergo not, you

479
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:35,000
know, like why?

480
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:41,000
It's like that scene in Total Recall, and
you're missing a third hand, Dan.

481
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
I totally get what you mean.

482
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Yeah. Anyway,
that's actually a trend on TikTok right

483
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:51,000
now.

484
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Wait, really? What's the total recall?
Third hand? Like the three-breasted woman.

485
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Stop. It totally is. My wife would show
me, she's like, is this real? I'm like,

486
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,000
there's zero chance it's real. It's AI.
But I think it's on TikTok or Instagram or

487
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,000
something where they got these like three
breasted models that are just popping up

488
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,000
everywhere. And it's just odd. And
actually, a lot of people don't know where

489
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,000
that's from because they're not old
enough. Yeah, so some because I told my

490
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,000
told my wife she's like look at this like
oh You mean like like what is that? What

491
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,000
are they trying to like make it look at
the girl from total recall? He's like

492
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,000
she's like what? Oh my god.

493
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Did they not put that on the new the
re-release the new version?

494
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Yeah, but they didn't though, because
that's not the new version, right? Okay.

495
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:45,000
The new version doesn't, I don't think,
no, actually, no, they do have one. I

496
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:49,000
think they, I think they do. I think they
have one. Yeah. I think they do have it,

497
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:53,000
but you know, Colin Farrell, right? Yeah.
Yeah. But, the new total recall doesn't go

498
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,000
to Mars, you know, get you asked the Mars,
like, Oh, right.

499
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
It's all like through the center of the
planet or something to the other side of

500
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
the planet.

501
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:07,000
At first, I actually didn't like that
movie, but it grew on me. Like, cause I'm

502
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:12,000
a huge fan of the original. of Paul
Verhoeven, original. But when I saw the

503
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:17,000
new Total Recall, I'm like, what is this
shit? This is bullshit. He doesn't even go

504
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:22,000
to Mars. But then it just grew on me. It's
actually a pretty OK movie. It's

505
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:27,000
interesting. Yeah, but anyway.

506
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:33,000
So right now, Palm is at what? We haven't
calculated the market cap yet, actually.

507
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:38,000
FDV right now is at about 80 million. So I
think that makes Palm Like, maybe 10

508
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:43,000
something like that like 10 millions. I I
I honestly I I would have to calculate it

509
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:48,000
But I think it's like 10 maybe a little
bit more. So you got six times to get the

510
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Ergo That's 62k right 62 million right now
six and Ergo doesn't do anything then

511
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:58,000
yeah, It could do that. But like I said, I
don't know how I'd feel about that like on

512
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:03,000
one side would be like, oh, yeah this is
great on the other side of like Damn it,

513
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:08,000
like, why, come on, Ergo. You know, do
something, do something. Move it, man,

514
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:13,000
come on, come on. The Palm is catching up
to you, come on, man. Anyway, yeah, so,

515
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:18,000
like, that's, that's, that's, that's
something, like, literally a conversation

516
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:23,000
that I had today.

517
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:37,000
We got another question from Matus Bor.
Yeah, you got it. Hello fellow Ergonauts.

518
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:41,000
I was wondering if anyone is actively
targeting the gaming community. It would

519
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:45,000
be interesting to onboard people who can
mine while they are not playing games.

520
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Yeah, Mark the shark. I think that's a
good approach to target those gamers. I'm

521
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:56,000
looking at Mark's dashboard and he's got a
nice little bar graph. a progress bar that

522
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:01,000
essentially says, hey, in order to get
bonus tokens, you need to mine for four

523
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:06,000
out of seven days or something like that
of the epoch of the week. So that's

524
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:11,000
something that can easily be done by a
gamer who, when they go to bed, they just

525
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:16,000
double click on the executable and walk
away. And when they come back to the

526
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:21,000
machine to game, they stop the executable,
they game, they do what they need to do,

527
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:26,000
and then they double click on them. so
those mining doesn't have to be persistent

528
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:31,000
right it can be done just on the spare
time so yeah mark the shark i think that's

529
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:36,000
a i think that's a great idea that
actually you know i actually saw something

530
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:41,000
that could be really interesting for for
this and i don't think

531
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:51,000
I don't know if this game is still around
or has been developed or whatever, and if

532
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:56,000
it's actually worldwide or maybe it's just
in Japan. But there was a game that they

533
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:01,000
kept advertising on the phone when you use
the free apps that have the commercials in

534
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:06,000
them. And it was called, I think, Idle
Heroes. something like that. And basically

535
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:11,000
the thing about it was, was that it didn't
have any like, like active gameplay. A lot

536
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:16,000
of the gameplay was passive gameplay. So
you would set it up, right? And then it

537
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:21,000
would actually like, when you turn off
your phone, the gameplay would happen and

538
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:26,000
like the battles would happen and stuff
like that. And then like you'd have to

539
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:31,000
turn off your phone and turn the game off
for the, for your characters to, to, to

540
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:36,000
evolve. right because they have these like
characters that would evolve when when

541
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:41,000
your phone it's like sort of like pokemon
you know like pokemons when they like

542
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:46,000
evolve to become like i don't know more
scary pokemons right right it was kind of

543
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:51,000
the same concept i actually always thought
that that would be really interesting for

544
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:56,000
for gamifying mining

545
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,000
No, I think you're right. So you'd feed
your characters with hash points that

546
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,000
you've earned, essentially, or shares that
you've collected.

547
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,000
You basically, you tell them what to do,
and then you put it into some passive mode

548
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:16,000
where it still mines. And you just kind
of, whatever you do, you can, you know,

549
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:20,000
through gamification, you can select the
type of mining or the Yeah, the rate of

550
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:24,000
whatever right and then it'll grow the
character and then you get rewards through

551
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:28,000
the game I always thought that that was
actually a really interesting way to to

552
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,000
gamify and incentivize Mining through
different devices to game through like

553
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:36,000
through game through through gameplay So
it might be a best idea yet dan better

554
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:40,000
than palm

555
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Then nothing is better than Palm.

556
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:53,000
No, so that's like the games I used to
play, the tech space web games I used to

557
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:57,000
play in the early 90s where you just go to
a website and you'd build up your army

558
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:01,000
slowly and then you'd choose to attack
somebody. And then when you came back,

559
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:05,000
you'd learn the results of the battle or
else while you were away from the

560
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:09,000
computer, somebody attacked you kind of
thing. It's all just database stats

561
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:13,000
hitting against stats like that. Yeah,
that's a really cool idea. Feed them with

562
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:17,000
your bonus points or the shares that you
pull from your mining pools and that kind

563
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:21,000
of thing. I mean, the big farms would be
able to murder you, so you'd have to have

564
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:25,000
some sort of equalizer out there or some
sort of diminishing return for the huge,

565
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:29,000
huge farms that are playing. But yeah,
that's a really cool idea. Mark can

566
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:33,000
probably vibe code that in a couple days,
so maybe he'll do it.

567
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:44,000
I think it's actually not that hard to
code. It's just the actual graphics. It

568
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:49,000
just has to be aesthetically pleasing. It
just has to look cool, right? But that's

569
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:54,000
just art, and we've got artists in the
community, so they could actually do that.

570
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:59,000
It shouldn't be a difficult thing to do.
But yeah, I just always thought that that

571
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:04,000
would actually be a really good way to
incentivize mining, and especially with

572
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Ergo, where you can actually use all these
different devices for mining. You know,

573
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:14,000
you could do that. I think actually they
used to do something similar with Bitcoin

574
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:19,000
way back in the day, where there's like an
app that I forgot exactly what it did, but

575
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:24,000
it was basically like an app where you
would watch advertisements and the more

576
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:29,000
advertisements you'd watch, they'd pay you
in Bitcoin for watching advertisements.

577
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Awesome. Oh, I got five, I got six more
minutes before I have to go. Let's bang

578
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:45,000
these questions out, Dan. Mark says that
that's what he's kind of working on with

579
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:49,000
HashMons and CA has the art ready to go,
go, go. So it'll be more of a tech space

580
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:53,000
stat kind of. initial thing, which I think
is a great way to start it. Awesome. All

581
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:57,000
right. Wendy moon says, do you think Ergo
will get more attention when the emission

582
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:01,000
reaching almost zero as the only proof of
work change to not rely on emission? You

583
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:05,000
said it in the end, Wendy, you said it on
the last part of your sentence. I think

584
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Ergo was going to get even more attention.
When people realize that Ergo is actually

585
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:13,000
thought of the end game, they thought of
sustaining a chain after emission, tails,

586
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:17,000
you know, so I think that's a big, a big
plus for Ergo. And you see it now, if you

587
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:21,000
hide over the Sigmanauts mining pool,
you'll see, I think Mark said he

588
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:25,000
distributed 98 ERGs or this, close to that
in the wallet, the other week, from

589
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:29,000
storage rent alone plus bonus tokens as
well and things like hopefully in the

590
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:33,000
future where you'll be able to do token
releases through minor protocols right so

591
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:37,000
somebody like Dan could give you know a
couple hundred thousand tokens to to Mark

592
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:41,000
and people that would be mining would then
be released those tokens to it so yeah

593
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:59,000
ICOs via mining. I mean, what more fair
ways are coin releases and offerings

594
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:03,000
initially for people actually putting in
the raw labor to keep the chain secure? So

595
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:07,000
I don't know why there's not more of that.
Honestly, I don't know why token launches

596
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:11,000
are at least on proof of work chains. Why
token launches are done through these

597
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:15,000
token launching platforms as opposed to,
you know, feeding it out to the miners and

598
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:19,000
then the miners are welcome to sell it.
And then the community can buy it from the

599
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:23,000
DEXes kind of thing. So yeah, but yeah,
Wendy, I think, I think that's a huge

600
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:27,000
thing that's going to put Ergo above
everybody else eventually when they look

601
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:31,000
at it.

602
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:46,000
All right, we got a bunch of things. You
see anything else?

603
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Yeah. Okay. I mean, there's a couple of
Palm questions, I don't know. But let's

604
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:56,000
say, do we have any Ergo questions? I
mean, I'd be more than happy to answer

605
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Palm questions, but I want to answer Ergo
questions.

606
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Luke Grasmith says, will we protect
foreigners and Canadian people from ICE if

607
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:11,000
they attend Colorado meetings? And Mark
says, at best, Colorado is open carry.

608
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:16,000
Perfect.

609
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Yep. There you go. So yeah, don't, don't,
don't fuck with Colorado, Colorado.

610
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Let's see. Oh, here we go. A personal
question. BodyMax Fitness, who I think is

611
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:36,000
a big 3D, maybe. qx(), would you ever
leave Ergo? At what point do you say

612
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:42,000
enough? I'm moving on. There's nothing to
move on to, guys. There's nothing else in

613
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:48,000
the ecosystem or in the space that does
what Ergo does. I see Ergo in my own use

614
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:54,000
as a utility here on campus. Right now,
it's integrated into our charging system

615
00:52:54,000 --> 00:53:00,000
for plot billing. And I just saw two
students pay for plots with ERG while we

616
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:06,000
were in this meeting. You can see it on
the chain if you're looking. It's going to

617
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:12,000
be integrated into a DAO eventually as
well. I can't do that with anything else,

618
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:18,000
I don't feel. No, I don't think there's a
point in my immediate future where I think

619
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:24,000
of Ergo as a failure ever.

620
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Let's take a hypothetical. Let's say the
crypto market goes through a really cold

621
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:35,000
winter, a lot of things disappear, Ergo
goes down to an all-time low like

622
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:40,000
everything else. I'm still going to be
using Ergo to do my stuff here. I'm still

623
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:45,000
going to be building on it. So that's the
resilience of Ergo compared to other

624
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:50,000
chains where you have somebody with a big
fat wallet holding a lot of tokens that

625
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:55,000
all of a sudden decides it's not worth it
and move on. So no. The answer is no.

626
00:53:55,000 --> 00:54:00,000
There's nothing in my immediate there or
my future that says I'm done. All right,

627
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:05,000
we got one minute.

628
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:16,000
One minute and then ignition. All right,
let's see. All right, so what should we

629
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:24,000
answer here, the last thing that we should
answer?

630
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:30,000
Lord Black gave a shout out to ERGs
awesome anybody else mining with AI cards

631
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:35,000
no i think from what i heard lord black i
think mark was mark and Cannon were

632
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:40,000
talking to somebody about it i can't
remember but the problem with the ai farms

633
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:45,000
right now because i thought was right hey
let's Let's advertise to these AI farms

634
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:50,000
that they can also mine cryptocurrency on
their downtime when they're not being

635
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:55,000
fully utilized. But as of yet, from what I
understand, the AI farms are getting

636
00:54:55,000 --> 00:55:00,000
pounded just relentlessly. There's no
space that they can actually do that yet.

637
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:05,000
So maybe in the future, when AI gets more
optimized, I think OpenAI just came out

638
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:10,000
with something that said that was the case
with one of the new models. You'll have

639
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:15,000
some space that maybe we can start pinging
these guys and saying, hey, you guys

640
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:20,000
should mine some cryptocurrency while
you're not doing AI.

641
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:33,000
What is it? Armeanio is working on some
idea where he's got something on the back,

642
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:38,000
back, back burner in his head about
utilizing AI and a side chain specifically

643
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:43,000
for that kind of thing. For all these
cards that are no longer useful for AI,

644
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:48,000
might still be useful for mining, and are
still very, very much powerful, can mine a

645
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:53,000
side chain. Yeah. And Lord Black, yeah,
I'm running like 20 nodes. No, more like

646
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:58,000
probably 10, but yeah. And just a shout
out again to Satergo for anybody who wants

647
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:03,000
to get into the node market. Super easy
desktop wallet. One click node install.

648
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Really, really nice and easy.

649
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:16,000
All right. Well, I think we heard enough
about your node there, qx().

650
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Yes.

651
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:23,000
Well, where do you got to go? I got to
go. I got to go, guys. Alright, well, I

652
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:29,000
guess great to see everybody qx() needs to
run Probably to the boys room No meeting.

653
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:35,000
Yeah, so I guess we'll wrap it up from
here for now All right. Well, so next next

654
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:41,000
week same time same place same channel and
until then this is Dan Barely alive, but

655
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:47,000
still kicking from Japan With qx(), who
you can almost call a man. Forget that.

656
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:53,000
When you can. Signing off. Ciao,
everybody.
