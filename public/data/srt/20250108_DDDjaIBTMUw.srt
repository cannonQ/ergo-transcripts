1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Good day everyone, I am Alexander
Chepurnoy, also known as kushti,

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
co-developer of Ergo, proof-of-work
cryptocurrency, realizing the concept of

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
programmable money, and my talk would be
about property rights in the age of

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
programmable money.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:26,000
And the talk will connect some dots.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
In particular, it will connect previously
US-sanctioned smart contract, so

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
autonomous code on blockchain which got
sanctioned.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Money of the future, so programmable
money, tokenized real world and blockchain

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
assets such as art objects and property
rights.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
And if you are talking about property
rights of the future, so programmable

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
property rights as well.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
OK, so let's start.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:04,000
So what could be a property when we are
talking about digital world, blockchain

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:12,000
world, where we can have autonomous code
while handling some money, some tokens?

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,000
So there was a very interesting case
recently, a case of Tornado Cash.

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Tornado Cash is a service that is mixing
potentially identifiable cryptocurrency

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,000
funds with others to obscure the trail
back to the funds original source.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
This is a privacy tool used in Ethereum
and

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Ethereum-like networks where all the
transactions are public by default.

20
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:51,000
And at some point the US Department of
the Treasury blacklisted the protocol.

21
00:01:51,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And then, very recently, on November 26,
2024, a U.S. federal appeals court

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:09,000
overturned an earlier ruling stating that
the law could not sanction a protocol.

23
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Well, if we are talking about details, so
exact words are that Tornado Cash's

24
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
immutable smart contracts.

25
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:27,000
The lines of privacy enabling software
codes are not the property of a foreign

26
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:35,000
national entity, meaning that they cannot
be blocked under different regulations.

27
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Alright, so here we have that if some
code is not associated, some code along

28
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:56,000
with its assets, right, such as assets
been mixed by Tornado Cash.

29
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Autonomous smart contract so both the
code and the assets it's owning in the

30
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:10,000
process of mixing not recognized as
someone's - so individual or company

31
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:17,000
property.

32
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:25,000
At least according to current US laws,
but probably in other jurisdictions it

33
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:32,000
would be the same, but yeah, it's the very
new thing. It's just a few days basically,

34
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:39,000
like two weeks in just one jurisdiction.

35
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,000
And the same results we got.

36
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,000
The same results maybe in a bit more
technical form, because we are not

37
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,000
lawyers, we are developers.

38
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Developing the concept of programmable
money.

39
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:11,000
So in our physical real world every bank
note is not protecting itself, right?

40
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
So it's passive.

41
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
And in the digital world, so in the
setting of programmable money, every

42
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
digital bank note is protected by a public
key or many keys and also potentially

43
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
programmable logic.

44
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Every digital bank note is protecting
itself with some program and execution of

45
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
that program possibly with signature check
after decides whether a note may be spent

46
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
or not.

47
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:54,000
And this is actually already quite old
concepts going from Bitcoin, early days of

48
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Bitcoin, even Bitcoin script, but
developed in the Ergo community.

49
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:09,000
And so in case of blockchain based
programmable money like Ergo or Bitcoin we

50
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:15,000
have programmable logic expressed against
the state of the blockchain right because

51
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,000
on the blockchain everything is just the
state of the blockchain. To be connected

52
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,000
to the external world you need for trusted
entities and the whole point of the

53
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:33,000
blockchain is to avoid trust.

54
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
But we can imagine non blockchain based
programmable money also where logic is

55
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
expressed against state.

56
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Every user of a money system agreed or
enforced to be agreed on.

57
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Example of that could be CBDC central
bank digital currency but I'm not aware of

58
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
any using such programmability at the
moment but in the future that would be the

59
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
case probably.

60
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:10,000
And then in the age of programmable money
the talk about ownership is becoming more

61
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,000
complex so we have individual

62
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:24,000
ownership when a digital banknote belongs
to just one key, always right, depends on

63
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:32,000
time and other things which are happening
on the blockchain.

64
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:39,000
We also may have cooperative property
when a node belongs to multiple keys, for

65
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:46,000
example, with quorum voting needed to
spend a node.

66
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:53,000
And also we may have contractual
property, right, so autonomous property,

67
00:06:53,000 --> 00:07:00,000
property which belongs to autonomous
contracts such as Tornado Cash in

68
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:07,000
the example I've provided before.

69
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:18,000
So we can define contractual ownership
when an owner could not be defined, right?

70
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
When there is no owner, for example,
right?

71
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
So owner could be pseudo randomly chosen.

72
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Maybe in future or maybe we have rotating

73
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:38,000
right to do some things based on
randomness pseudo randomness if we are

74
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:46,000
talking about blockchain or maybe an owner
will be decided based on

75
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
the state of blockchain right in future.

76
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
So maybe it will go to a miner of
particular block on the blockchain or

77
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
whatever.

78
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
There could be very different options
here.

79
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:14,000
And yeah in this case when we cannot
identify owner because it will be decided

80
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:22,000
by a program at certain point there is no
any owner at all.

81
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Then we are talking about contractual
property.

82
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Right those things maybe a bit abstract
for you guys so let's talk about art now

83
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:43,000
let's talk about things which are closer
to you guys let's talk about tokenized art

84
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:51,000
so what's people are now doing

85
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:02,000
with art and blockchain so there are two
options so first you may tokenize physical

86
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:11,000
art ownership usually by dividing
ownership rights and pieces right and

87
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:20,000
issuing tokens where one token is
corresponding to one piece

88
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:29,000
of an art object and then we have
tokenized ownership with for example 1000

89
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:38,000
tokens representing the full ownership of
our art object.

90
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Another option is to create digital art
and put it on the blockchain.

91
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
You can

92
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:57,000
break it into pieces as well, but in this
case it's more popular to make an NFT, so

93
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:05,000
a single token which is associated with,
for example, this black swan picture.

94
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
All right.

95
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
And this is just one dimension of
ownership, right?

96
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Let's call it quantization dimension.

97
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:23,000
So you can have a single token
representing the whole art object, or you

98
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:29,000
may have multiple tokens each representing
part of a digital or physical art object.

99
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:38,000
OK, but then, going back to programmable
money,

100
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:48,000
there is another dimension, so every
token, whether it's NFT or one token out

101
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:58,000
of 1000, can be protected by a public key
or many keys or even programmable logic.

102
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Right and similar to programmable money
program execution with possible signature

103
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:12,000
check after decides whether a token may be
transferred from existing owner to a new

104
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:19,000
one or not.

105
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
And

106
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
here we have options we already defined,
so individual, collective and contractual

107
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
ownership.

108
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,000
But in case of multiple tokens
representing an art object, for example,

109
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,000
there could be different options for
different pieces, right?

110
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Of an art object means different tokens.

111
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:54,000
For example, we can imagine 200 tokens
out of 1,000 to be owned by an art

112
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:02,000
gallery, 100 tokens by a painter's
cooperative, for example, with 9 out of 15

113
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:10,000
signatures needed for transfer rights, or
we have 15

114
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,000
signatories in the cooperative and then
nine is enough for transfer, nine

115
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:22,000
signatures.

116
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:30,000
And then we can lock 700 remaining tokens
to a contract which puts one token every

117
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:37,000
week, for example, on a decentralized
blockchain-based auction, right?

118
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:45,000
And for those 700 tokens at the beginning
we have contractual ownership, right?

119
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:51,000
But then, yeah, after auctions those 700
tokens would be possessed by other

120
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:57,000
entities, right, and they could be
individual, collective or contractual

121
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:03,000
again.

122
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Right, so this world is going to be quite
complicated, right, and also exciting

123
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:23,000
because with contractual ownership we also
have contractual possibilities.

124
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:32,000
We may do a lot of experiments around
sales of art objects, right?

125
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I think even from this simple example
this is becoming quite obvious.

126
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:47,000
And so we may discover a lot of new sales
models.

127
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:54,000
We can have trading boosting by liquidity
provision.

128
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Right, which can be made a part of
emission contract, for example.

129
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:07,000
So in this example where we are selling
700 tokens one by one, every week on a

130
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:15,000
decentralized blockchain based auction.

131
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:23,000
We may require proceedings from auction
to be going to liquidity pool.

132
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Right, so then those tokens would have
good liquidity.

133
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Right, in a liquidity pool where we have
tokens representing art objects along with

134
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:53,000
tokens representing Euro, for example,
right, or USD or gold or cryptocurrency

135
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:59,000
tokens such as ERG or whatever.

136
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:06,000
OK, then we can have time logs, for
example, to prevent immediate sales where

137
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:12,000
it's needed, where it makes sense
contractually and so on.

138
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
And by

139
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:22,000
doing all those new things and by
combining them differently.

140
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:30,000
We are bringing our financialization of
art to completely new level, making

141
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:38,000
financial schemes around such
financialization also a kind of art.

142
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
All right.

143
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:47,000
And there are a lot of tools already
available in the Ergo ecosystem, such as

144
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:53,000
airdrop tools to reward some community
with tokens.

145
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Auction coin framework to emit tokens via
auctions periodically.

146
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:07,000
As in our example, and possibly inject
funds raised into liquidity pools.

147
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Then there are a lot of fundraising tools
such as MewFinance where you can

148
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
fundraise.

149
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,000
You can raise funds to do a new art
object, right, and after tokenizing it you

150
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:26,000
can reward

151
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:34,000
contributors with tokens.

152
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
There are auctions where you can put
NFTs.

153
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
There are already a lot of NFTs there.

154
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:46,000
There is some tooling - decentralized
autonomous organization it's called, but

155
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:52,000
we can call it just digital cooperatives.

156
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
And this tooling is for token based
decision making.

157
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:06,000
There is such tool Paideia on Ergo and
you can use it, for example, to have some

158
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:15,000
kind of cooperative rights associated with
some art object, for example.

159
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Or you can tokenize maybe some collection
or even some movement art movement and so

160
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,000
on.

161
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
You may have liquidity pools, order book
based decentralized exchanges and so on,

162
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
so on.

163
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:41,000
You may have NFT collections, so combine
different

164
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:49,000
unique pieces like this black swan along
with white swan for example and maybe pink

165
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:57,000
flamingo and so on into a single
collection with some common properties.

166
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
And so on, so on, so on.

167
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,000
So there are a lot of tools already and a
lot of possibilities outlined in this talk

168
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,000
and not only.

169
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:18,000
So let's discover the new age of finance
together.

170
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:25,000
And I hope, with all those new schemes
there would be a lot of experiments on how

171
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:32,000
to tokenize or to build also sustainable
finance right for artists at least, but

172
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:39,000
not only.

173
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:50,000
OK, so please check the links where you
can find tooling mentioned.

174
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:59,000
And here is Ergo's Telegram group and my
personal Twitter.

175
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Thank you for your attention.

176
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Have a great event.

177
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Bye.
