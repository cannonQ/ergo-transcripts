1
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Alright, here we go, guys.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Welcome.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Mark, how's it going, dude?

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Hey, I'm doing good. Doing good. How
about yourself, Tim?

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I'm good, dude. A little cold. It's still
cold but I got my coffee now.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I'm good.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I had a little coffee incident this
morning and I forgot to close the lid and

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
so all the water just evaporated instead
of making me coffee.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Oh no.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I had to correct that.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
So we got a guest today, Pepper, the
anonymous. What's going on Pepper? How's

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
it going dude?

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Hey, hi Tim. Hi Mark. Thanks for inviting
me on today.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Yeah, I'm really good. Mark, it's
obviously taking a little bit of a dump

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
this time of recording at the moment, but
Ergo overall has been doing really well.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The ecosystem seems to be flourishing. So
yeah, I'm just keen to sort of kick some

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
things around with you, discuss Pepper,
discuss meme coins, discuss Ergo, and go

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
from there, really.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Yeah, for sure. Well, thanks. Thanks for
joining. It's really cool to have another

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
guest on.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I know Mark's probably tired of talking
to me, listening to me talk.

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Oh, stop. No way.

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I was thinking about vice versa.

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
No, but it's still so.

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Some cool stuff happened recently, like
the quantum computing benchmark was

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
surpassed or whatever. Do you all have any
thoughts about the quantum computing and

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
how that might impact blockchain or not?

28
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Yeah, I always see AI and obviously fast
computing speeds as being something that

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:03,000
humans can work with, I don't necessarily
think that it's going to affect the

30
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:10,000
security of Bitcoin because just around
the difficulty adjustment with SHA256.

31
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,000
However, in terms of helping people
produce better code or better blockchains,

32
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
then yeah, sure. I think this is a great
thing to have in our arsenal.

33
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Yeah. And I'd say for me, I'm not really
too sure. I haven't really looked too much

34
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
into it. I think isn't there the notion,
like the biggest thing that would be

35
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
worried about right from a quantum
computing perspective is just the quantum

36
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
computers being able to essentially
generate your keys. And then it's like

37
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
your pass phrase.

38
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Yeah. Right. Yeah. I, you're more
technical than me, Mark, but just like, I

39
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
really enjoyed watching Christian kind of
talk about it.

40
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
And he was just like, nah, you know, all
we have to do is make the hash function

41
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
just a little bit more difficult. And then
it gets exponentially more difficult to

42
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
solve. And there's still like several
steps away from even approaching where

43
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Bitcoin is currently.

44
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
So it's just not something to worry
about. And then I actually saw another

45
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
post today where dude was like, Satoshi
was talking about what you need to do in

46
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
2009. And it's the same thing. Like you
just increase the difficulty a little bit

47
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
and it's fine.

48
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Okay. Yeah, seems overblown.

49
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Yeah, okay. Interesting. How does the
difficulty correlate, I guess, with the

50
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
brute force of the keys? You know, because
isn't that like, I guess the concern?

51
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I don't think it means like not like
mining difficulty, like not like the

52
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
number of hashes required to find it, but
actually the length of the hash function

53
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
maybe is a little bit longer. And so the
more digits you would add to that, the

54
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
more difficult it would be to solve.

55
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Okay, right. Now that makes sense. So
yeah, then it's because it probably gets

56
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
very, hopefully, right logarithmic in some
sense where it's just like, or I don't

57
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
know if that's the right one.

58
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Exponential, yes.

59
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Yeah, exponential, yeah, absolutely.
Yeah, interesting. I saw a kushti tweet

60
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
about it, and he was like, oh, we're not,
like you were saying, it's like, yeah, we

61
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
don't really need to worry about this. So
I was like, okay, cool, I'll just go back

62
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
into my cave, so to speak, and continue
doing my thing.

63
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Yeah, if any big brain listeners have
some more details, let us know. I'm super

64
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:43,000
interested to learn and I don't know.

65
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
All right, so can I just call you Pepe
because PepERG is a little bit difficult

66
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
to say.

67
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Yeah. Can you tell me about yourself?
What's up, man?

68
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Yeah, absolutely. So yeah, thanks again
for inviting me on, especially just to

69
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
give you just a brief precis of my
background.

70
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
So I've come from a business background
myself. I own a couple of companies, a

71
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
development company as well. And I suppose
that's one of the reasons why I'm not

72
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
really keen to dox is that in terms of
employees and partners that work with me,

73
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I've seen come back.

74
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I think you don't want your parents to
see.

75
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Yeah, yeah.

76
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
It's the online backlash that you get
from, yeah, we had it early days in one of

77
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
our competitions around somebody didn't
quite follow the rules. We're always

78
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
really prescriptive on the rules of games
and, you know, rage dumping off the

79
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
competitions is fine, but any kind of sort
of backlash from anybody else affects

80
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
people's daily lives.

81
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Yeah, it's not worth it. So in terms of,
I suppose in terms of myself, I've been in

82
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:03,000
crypto actively since around about mid
2017.

83
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Initial exposure to Bitcoin was, you
know, six, seven years before that. But

84
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
like many people, I didn't immediately
engage. Obviously, I wish I did, but I

85
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
didn't at the time. It was, you know,
funny internet money. So I kind of

86
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
dismissed it.

87
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
It was really in that run of 2017 when
Ethereum really came to life. And I

88
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
suppose I started really picking up on
major podcasters like Andreas Antonopoulos

89
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
and some of his lectures that I really
kind of understood, wow, this is going to

90
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
change the world.

91
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
For me, really, it was actually executing
a smart contract. I don't know if you guys

92
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
were around at the time, but EOS were
doing an ICO, and you basically had to

93
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
knit a couple of ERC20 contracts together.

94
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I can remember executing that, obviously
self-taught. I'm not a technical

95
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
background myself. I thought, yeah, this
is going to take off.

96
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I think one of the most important things
in crypto, and I think Sigmanauts,

97
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
especially guys like this and people who
have been within our community for months,

98
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,000
will know that you stay engaged in the
market during busts.

99
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
When it's dead, that's when you build.
That seems central to our philosophy.

100
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I stayed very much within that bear
market, discovered Cardano, following

101
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Charles quite deeply, seeing obviously the
boom of Cardano, seeing the boom of

102
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
decentralized exchanges, Uniswap Pancakes,
Sushi were doing well, and going down the

103
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Cardano native token route and found
Spectrum DEX.

104
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I thought, what is this? And then I
looked into, obviously, I found Ergo, and

105
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I immediately thought, okay, so this is
fair launch. There's that amazing graph

106
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
that you see on X sometimes, which has got
the distributions of early tokens to

107
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
founders and pre-seed, and you've got Ergo
with this thin slice.

108
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
and the rest for mining. And I just
thought, okay, I'll buy into that.

109
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I'll buy into proof of work for reasons
that Joe Armeanio has spoken about in

110
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
terms of market entry without KYC. I
personally massively believe in that. I've

111
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,000
got a network in West Africa and I see
these guys that they don't have bank

112
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
accounts, they don't have IDs, but they do
have sunshine.

113
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
They do potentially have and all bits of
hardware so entering into that ecosystem

114
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
cryptocurrency is really for is for micro
tipping it's for giving people access to

115
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
financial services so that piece obviously
the proof of work element around grid

116
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
management and power balancing I can also
see huge legs in so

117
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Seeing proof of work and then seeing what
Ergo was about the ethos and then some of

118
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
the principles that they had around
decentralized fairness and the open source

119
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
development piece.

120
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I just thought was really strong and I
was like, this is one I can, I understand

121
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
why it's not been marketed, why it's not
been pushed. Because it's about a huge

122
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
group of people coming together,
dedicating their time, just like you guys

123
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
are today, dedicating their time and
building something.

124
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:22,000
So, you know, pre-PepERG, I was very much
active on Twitter, evangelizing Ergo. I

125
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:29,000
went under RedDragon the Sigmanauts,
probably had 300, 400 organic followers.

126
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:35,000
You can look back in the Twitter history
around that, and then essentially launched

127
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:41,000
PepERG back in what July 20, 2023. And
yeah, and here we are today.

128
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Okay, man. Yeah, thanks. Thanks for the
rundown. Sounds like you're on the team,

129
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:54,000
you know, you have a lot of the same
opinions as many of us do.

130
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
So yeah, right on. And it's a pleasure to
meet you really.

131
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Yeah, absolutely. I think today it's
going to be interesting to talk about

132
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
obviously meme tokens and meme coins and
because I think the interesting thing that

133
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I found about Ergo is that why I don't
actually think that meme tokens have been

134
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
hugely pervasive on our chain is because
people seem to be more interested in

135
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
actually building real

136
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
real life stuff and useful applications,
mostly. So I think we will see a huge

137
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
growth of meme coins and meme tokens on
Ergo though. So I think there is going to

138
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
be that to come.

139
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
So alright, so I'm going to do a couple
of things right now. First is the KYA, you

140
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,000
know, if anybody listening has not
noticed. I don't know, Pepper, this person

141
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,000
we're interviewing, glad to have you on.

142
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
But I think it's a healthy thing to just
like be a little bit skeptical of things

143
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
in the crypto space.

144
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,000
And I want to start at the bottom, like,
what is a meme token? Like, what does meme

145
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,000
token? Let's start there. Because, you
know, we talk about coins, you know, ERG

146
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,000
is a coin that gets mined.

147
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,000
It's the utility token of Ergo, like the
main thing. And then there's native tokens

148
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
where, you know, we have some governance
tokens or project tokens that may or may

149
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,000
not be useful.

150
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,000
But what is a meme token? What does that
mean?

151
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:42,000
If we talk about the history of meme
tokens and meme coins, and I use the

152
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:48,000
phrase interchangeably because I think
there is a difference. And so I think most

153
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:54,000
people would agree that Dogecoin was
probably the first original meme coin.

154
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,000
OK. And what maybe people aren't too
aware of is that Dogecoin fork of Bitcoin

155
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:06,000
in 2013 less energy intensive consensus
algorithm. It has implemented a lot of the

156
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:12,000
upgrades that Bitcoin has been through,
specifically Taproot in 2021.

157
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,000
That has now actually sprouted its own
native ecosystems around DRC20 tokens,

158
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,000
runes, you get NFTs now based on that
platform.

159
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
You've got, whilst people think of
Dogecoin as a meme, it's actually a pretty

160
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
powerful legacy blockchain protocol which
can be used for various different

161
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
applications.

162
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
It's an incredibly strong referencing
system and everything really that Bitcoin

163
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
is in a way obviously, albeit having an
inflationary supply,

164
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Meme tokens, I think are probably, they
came in a bit later. I think really when

165
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:55,000
we saw the real growth of meme tokens was
probably in Shiba Inu.

166
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,000
That was an ERC-20 token that was
essentially pre-printed, not mined,

167
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,000
pre-printed, put into circulation. We had
some pools of liquidity and then the hype

168
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,000
was just created and then it obviously
grew exponentially.

169
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,000
So I think meme tokens really are more
synonymous with a speculative token,

170
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,000
something that doesn't actually have a
specific use case other than hoping to buy

171
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,000
it and sell it at a higher price.

172
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I think what we're seeing as well is that
we've gone from this kind of animal meta

173
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,000
over the last sort of four or five years
and we seem to be edging into this like

174
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,000
food meta and even like a clothing and I
think there'll be places and people and

175
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,000
politicians exactly and we've seen a
massive overproduction of meme coins so

176
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,000
there's around about I say meme coins meme
tokens around about 10,000 new meme tokens

177
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,000
daily across the entirety of crypto so

178
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:05,000
They have developed though, I think, in
terms of some of their primary use cases.

179
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I mentioned there about price speculation,
obviously, tippings and payments. People

180
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:17,000
within Ergo, we use it as a tipping
method.

181
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,000
You've got things like community
engagement. We tend to run a lot of

182
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,000
competitions. I know that Comet does a
similar thing and has been involved in

183
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,000
decentralized app testing.

184
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
And also I think that, specifically in
Ergo actually, because we are a relatively

185
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
small and tight-knit ecosystem, it has
allowed people to create and sort of

186
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
develop their own brands or capitalize on
existing popular culture brands as well.

187
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
So there is a lot to unpack there, to be
honest with you, because you could also

188
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
talk about Yeah, the dearth of religion.
And this goes on to some of the things

189
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
that have been publicized more recently
around, you know, people are thinking, you

190
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
know, I need something I want a cult to
attach some sort of belief and interest

191
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
in.

192
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
And that's where people are looking at
meme tokens as something to serve that

193
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
purpose.

194
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Yeah, would you? Would you say, you know,
kind of comparing meme tokens, meme coins,

195
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:27,000
right? Just playing devil's advocate here.

196
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:32,000
But, you know, wouldn't you say meme
tokens are sort of like the antithesis of

197
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,000
like cryptocurrency just because it's kind
of like in some sense, right? Right. There

198
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,000
is a fixed supply, but also it's in some
sense, it's easy money if in comparison to

199
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Bitcoin or even Dogecoin, because it's

200
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Like, because you can mine it there's
assets that you have to then emit this

201
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
token, whereas meme tokens, there, it's
all emitted. And then from there, it's

202
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
based upon the founder and things like
that to distribute it to lock it and then

203
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
you got to inherently sort of have to
trust the other person on the other end.

204
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,000
versus, you know, trusting the consensus
algorithm. So it's more of like a social

205
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,000
consensus mechanism compared to sort of a
trustless thing. So it's inherently

206
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,000
permissioned, right? So I don't know, what
are your thoughts kind of on that?

207
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Yeah, I think that traditional ERC 20
meme coins were like that. And I think

208
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:35,000
that presents some problems and some
opportunities, I think,

209
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
From a problem perspective, it's about
distribution. Yeah, when I started Pepper,

210
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
it was a joke, right? I wanted to show my
friend how to use it off the back of an

211
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Ergoversary video.

212
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
And I thought, why not bring Pepe to
Ergo? Like, I love Pepe. I love Ergo.

213
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Let's create this.

214
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
And then suddenly, immediately, you're
hit by, okay, I've got 100% of these

215
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
tokens in my wallet. How do we then
distribute it? Okay, I've got to put money

216
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
into a liquidity pool. Okay, right, now
people are starting to ask about

217
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
tokenomics. And you kind of do it on the
fly. Obviously, a lot of other people are

218
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
much more planned about it in terms of how
they go about it.

219
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I think you are seeing though, in terms
of, And maybe they sit somewhere between

220
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,000
meme tokens and meme coins. But when
you're talking about Bitcoin native meme

221
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,000
coins or Dogecoin native ones, they've got
methods of essentially effectively minting

222
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,000
them.

223
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:42,000
So you would have 100% of the supply that
you're able to mint. You essentially pay a

224
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,000
production cost to send a mint, a
transaction. I'll execute a transaction,

225
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:54,000
then you get a certain amount of tokens.
That way essentially enables you to better

226
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:00,000
distribute the token amongst holders,
which is much more organic.

227
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
But what I've seen, and I think Ergo can
also relate to this really, is that

228
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
without having a central treasury or
having somebody who is pushing and making

229
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
decisions specifically, because a lot of
people rely on that, to be honest with

230
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
you, and they want that.

231
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
That's why leadership is a thing. Then
they can struggle to grow sometimes

232
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
because if you've got 100% minted out to
your holders, then how are you going to

233
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
get bounties for competitions? How are you
going to afford listing fees? You say,

234
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
well, let's all contribute together, but
it rarely happens.

235
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Yeah, I agree with everything both of you
just said. I guess first I'd say, I think

236
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:45,000
there is a little bit of a divide between
the ethos of meme tokens and I would say

237
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:51,000
authentic crypto projects where it's like,
you know, we've said this before, Mark,

238
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:57,000
like the purpose of crypto is not to make
you rich, it's to make people free.

239
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
And, you know, the first thing we said
here was like, yeah, you know, we're

240
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
hoping to buy this token and then sell it
for more. And so in that regard, it's much

241
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
more PVP than it is people working
together to make the pie bigger for

242
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
everyone.

243
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:23,000
And so, that's my first opinion. And it's
not that I'm against gambling. But I like

244
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:29,000
gambling. I like gambling on things like
UFC fights that I where I have like

245
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:35,000
knowledge and I can make an informed
decision and when it comes to me gambling

246
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:41,000
about like whether People are gonna buy
Joe Biden or not I have no idea, you know,

247
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I just have no idea and so that is my
hesitance, but I think as long as people

248
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:53,000
are actually

249
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
acknowledging what they're doing and not
just like, oh, yeah, well, Shiba Inu is

250
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
going to go to a dollar. Like, probably
not. They can be responsible and have fun

251
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
with the memes.

252
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
And that's kind of where it all starts,
especially on Ergo. That's really where it

253
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
started. Do you know the very first meme
token on Ergo?

254
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I'm pretty sure, correct me if I'm wrong,
I thought it was Erdoge, but it may be

255
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Erdoge.

256
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,000
No, it's Erdos. And the whole point of
that was that one of the developers asked

257
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,000
a community member to try out the token
minting utility.

258
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,000
And so he tried it out, you know, just
made a token and put no thought into any

259
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,000
of it and Now there's a 500,000 supply
token called Erdos and the founder just

260
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,000
literally gave it all away as like this
educational thing.

261
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Like, like, Hey, here's how you make
transactions. Do test transactions with

262
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
this instead of your ERGs, because this is
not valuable. And if you screw it up, like

263
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
who cares?

264
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
And so I actually love the Erdos. You
know, it's like the whole thing, like just

265
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
don't buy it. Don't spend any money on it.
Send it around. Try to collect them, you

266
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
know, I got a few and I've had some fun
doing that.

267
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:25,000
And it's nice to see some other things
come up and there are other schemes, you

268
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:31,000
know, like there was one called Bass, were
you around for the Bass token?

269
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Yeah, sure. That came out literally just
before I launched Pepper and there was

270
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
speculation that I was the Bass guy, but
just in a different form, which I was

271
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
like, whoa,

272
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,000
To be honest with you guys, I was not
part of, I was on Twitter. I was, and I

273
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
followed the YouTube videos and the weekly
updates, but I was not across Telegram, I

274
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
was not across Discord. So I was unaware
completely of these things before

275
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
obviously launching Pepper.

276
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Don't worry about it. I just thought it
was fun. It's like, oh yeah, you get a

277
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,000
random amount of tokens for your deposit.
That's a fun thing. And it ended up being

278
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:14,000
kind of cool, got big. What always
happens, you know.

279
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Yeah.

280
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Well, I think that was a slow rug. If
that's the thing. But I completely agree

281
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,000
with your sentiment about And this is my
experience as well with blockchains is

282
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,000
that people join them.

283
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
And this can be even noobs. They learn
about Bitcoin and then they go, no, no,

284
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
no. And then they actually then they look
at it further, they engage in it, and then

285
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
they suddenly get into an ecosystem and
then they suddenly want to use their

286
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
tokens and test out the ecosystem.

287
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,000
It literally happens across every single
layer one ever. And meme coins are

288
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,000
brilliant for, meme tokens are brilliant
for like Comet's done a great job in terms

289
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
of that testing.

290
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
They've been involved in loads of
different projects, Rosen Bridge,

291
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
specifically. They've worked on things
like decentralized lotteries. They've

292
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,000
worked on the token locking, refundable
ICOs. They've been like a test guinea pig

293
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,000
case because you're right, people don't
care so much about losing it.

294
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I think also from an educational point of
view, we've got something coming up this

295
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Thursday, Friday. We call it a snipe
competition, where you have to buy a very

296
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,000
specific amount of PepERG from MewFinance
or any other DEX alternative, and it's got

297
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:36,000
to be exactly 30,000 PepERG on the nose.

298
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
People are actually trying to do that,
and they're noticing things like slippage.

299
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
And to play that game, you're thinking,
oh, I missed that. Well, why did I miss

300
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
that? Oh, well, actually, maybe you need
to look at the things or slippage, like

301
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
reduce your thing down to 1%.

302
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
And so these kinds of things, learning
about blockchain, learning about how

303
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
markets work, they can be good. But like
you say, it should be about it really

304
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,000
should be about the educational piece
rather than just solely making money.

305
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
But yeah, the way that this world works
is that, you know, people want to make

306
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
money and they want to emulate the early
gains of Bitcoin and Dogecoin.

307
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Yeah, it's like memes are some emergent
property of blockchain. It's kind of fun.

308
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:24,000
That's cool. I like it. You know, another
one that was cool.

309
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:31,000
And also, like, I learned about game
theory and just how our DEXs work was

310
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Heisenberg. Did you see those? Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I've seen them.

311
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,000
So they locked, you know, it was like,
oh, we put in $5,000 worth of or 5,000 ERG

312
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,000
worth of liquidity. But the way it was set
up, like the founder would never lose

313
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
those ERG. You know, it's just like he's
just locking 5000 ERG and is going to

314
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,000
collect transaction fees because he has
all the LP and other people can gamble on

315
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,000
on, you know, whether or not this is going
to go up or down.

316
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,000
And he can't rug because it's locked, you
know, up to a point. You know, if everyone

317
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,000
sells their tokens back into the LP, it's
fine. Nobody's really losing a meaningful

318
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,000
amount of money. And the guy is going to
collect whatever the LP fee is going to

319
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,000
be.

320
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:25,000
I thought it was cool and kind of a fun
discovery for me.

321
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,000
I think that kind of leads on to things
around about what you're talking about,

322
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,000
knowing your assumptions, actually. So
there are, I'd say, first of all, there

323
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,000
are lots of different ways to launch
token.

324
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:43,000
There are, like we talked about in terms
of Bitcoin minting mechanisms or like kind

325
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:49,000
of like a faucet mechanism. or there was
this distribution mechanism.

326
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,000
One that I've seen do it really well,
I've been really impressed with and shout

327
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,000
out to Mav. He was really supportive when
I started Pepper back a year and a half

328
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,000
ago, and then he started Boba.

329
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,000
in March 2024. He has meticulously
planned and thought out those tokenomics.

330
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,000
He has got a great use case around the
utilities and competitions he puts

331
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,000
together and it's a small market cap,
yeah.

332
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:23,000
But in terms of how he's actually making
money from it, it's just not his primary

333
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:29,000
motive. He just wants a good token that's
well structured.

334
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,000
So that, for me, looking at things like
tokenomics and launch strategy is a key

335
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,000
part of it as well.

336
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Yeah, absolutely. Are there any other
things you guys would recommend to people

337
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,000
who are like, I'm considering buying this
meme token? What kind of categories of

338
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,000
things would they look at?

339
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,000
So we said, tokenomics, distribution.
What else would somebody want to look at

340
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,000
to make sure that they're, I don't know,
giving themselves a fighting chance in

341
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,000
this gamble that they're taking?

342
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Yeah, sure. I suppose I would look at
the, I would look at the history and the

343
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:17,000
actions of the developer or the leader of
the particular meme token.

344
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,000
I think I've had experience of rug pulls,
sketchy launches, they're often small,

345
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:28,000
they're inactive. and they usually end up
being a case of getting in a little bit of

346
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:33,000
liquidity and then they just dump the
whole supply on you.

347
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:41,000
So when things aren't laid out clearly,
then that would be a big flag for me. If

348
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:47,000
the Twitter accounts and the X accounts
and there's no website, then again, that's

349
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:53,000
a little bit of a flag to me.

350
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:58,000
I think one of the reasons why Pepper was
so successful so quickly was I was already

351
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,000
embedded in the community. I had hundreds
of followers on X.

352
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
So when I started to airdrop the token, I
got lots of replies. People were involved.

353
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
People reached out to me and had
conversations. And I was always open,

354
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
transparent, wanting to cooperate with
those individuals right from the very

355
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
start, asking for advice, et cetera.

356
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,000
So when you see that and you hear about
that, then you can probably think, OK,

357
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,000
this one's a little bit more legit. I
think you touched on it, Tim, around

358
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,000
locked liquidity.

359
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:36,000
So for instance, I've locked 6,000 ERG
into a liquidity pool for four or five

360
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:41,000
years. There's decent commitment there. in
terms of wanting the project to obviously

361
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:46,000
succeed and be there for the longer term.

362
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,000
So no locked liquidity, big problem. I
think when people said, oh, you should

363
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:58,000
throw away the keys to that ERG, I think
in, well, I don't want to do that, man.

364
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,000
This is good ERG. This is money here for
the future.

365
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Why would I do that? The whole point is
really is that it grows to a point, and

366
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
we've seen this with so many of the meme
coins, is that it grows to a point where

367
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
there's so much new interest and money
coming in that essentially it supports

368
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
itself.

369
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:23,000
It's no longer reliant on one single
individual. So those are probably a couple

370
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:28,000
of things that I would look for
personally.

371
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Yeah, I would say kind of some of the
similar things would be like, yeah, the

372
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
community, right, go in the chat, see how
active there are people are, you know, is

373
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
it one person or is like multiple people,
like, for example, right, you know,

374
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
hopefully this never happens.

375
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:49,000
But what happens if you get hit by a bus
tomorrow, you know, is everything still

376
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:54,000
going to be running on kind of full steam
ahead, so to speak. But I guess from an

377
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:59,000
investment perspective, I agree kind of
with Tim, this is more of a gamble.

378
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,000
And, and that's just my sort of look on
things. And so I'm not really willing to,

379
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:10,000
I'll buy some, you know, here and there,
but I'm not really willing to kind of put

380
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:15,000
a bunch of ERGs, I guess, into some of
these tokens, just because of the whole,

381
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:20,000
just, you know, there's gonna be human
manipulation involved inherently.

382
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,000
And so you know, like, what if you lost
your keys, for example, or, you know, or

383
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
there's some maybe alternative motives
that we don't know. And, you know, after

384
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,000
five years, maybe you rug it, you know
what I mean? I don't know, right? Not to

385
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
say you will not trying to, you know, that
inherently is like, is out there.

386
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,000
There's an attack vector, right? So I
mean, whereas if you were to maybe put it

387
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,000
through, like, some sort of emission
protocol.

388
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,000
So like I developed the minor rights
protocol and we're working on that. And so

389
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,000
maybe starting a meme token through that.
So then we can kind of bootstrap the Ergo

390
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,000
blockchain with the distribution of the
token.

391
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,000
And then that way the tokens are in a
proxy contract. They get distributed

392
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,000
through the miners and then it's sort of a
proxy, I guess, in some sense to how Doge

393
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,000
was without actually having to start a
whole new chain. and things like that.

394
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:19,000
But yeah, I think it's like kind of a
gamble. And so for me, you know, I make

395
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:24,000
decent money and I don't really gamble in
general. And so yeah, in general is almost

396
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:29,000
kind of a gamble. And so putting any more
money into that.

397
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,000
So it's all speculation. But of course,
you know, to each their own, you know, no

398
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,000
judgments by any means.

399
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Yeah, I think the re-emission contracts
or the emission contracts type mechanism

400
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:51,000
with a meme coin, I think that is going to
be a major trend actually going forward.

401
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,000
So I work across a couple of different
ecosystems, the Bitcoin ecosystem I'm

402
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,000
pretty heavily into, and you've got
innovations around, it's called DMT-NAP,

403
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,000
so digital matter theory, where they're
essentially looking at the bits in a

404
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,000
certain block

405
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,000
that will essentially get mined and
there's generally between sort of 2 to 400

406
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,000
bits per block on a decreasing scale and
essentially the miner that explodes that

407
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,000
block

408
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
wins those bits, which is essentially,
it's called NAT token, is a corresponding.

409
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,000
So that is a way that miners can further
profit from mining. They can sell this

410
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
into the open market.

411
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:41,000
And that, quote unquote, meme token has a
fairer distribution and emission. So I

412
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:48,000
think that is going to be a subsector of
meme coins and meme tokens.

413
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:53,000
I think in terms of the gambling aspect,
then yeah, sure. It's gambling to a

414
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:58,000
certain extent. I think pretty much
everything in life is gambling. You have

415
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:03,000
to take a risk. You always have to do
something like that.

416
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,000
That's what I tell my students. Literally
everything is a risk. Everything is a

417
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,000
trade-off, including doing nothing.

418
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Yeah, massive. Opportunity cost is
absolutely massive. I personally, being

419
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:22,000
close to memes generally across several
different ecosystems and developing a

420
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:27,000
sense for it, I know what I'm looking for.

421
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,000
I know what I'm looking at. And
therefore, I believe that I have an edge

422
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,000
in terms of actually picking these ones.
And sometimes you'll pick ones and you're

423
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,000
thinking, well, look, my expected return
is like 100 to 1000X.

424
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
That's pretty good. That's better than a
roulette table for sure. And I feel like

425
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
I've got an edge to sometimes knowing your
assumptions totally can actually just

426
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,000
reduce risk.

427
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,000
So it's just about what you're
comfortable with. I would put to answer a

428
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,000
question of something around, you know,
why should people care about I would say

429
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:03,000
you shouldn't care about them necessarily.

430
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:08,000
They serve entirely as an optional part
of cryptocurrency. You're better focused

431
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:13,000
spending your time on products that
actually add a tangible value.

432
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,000
However, the market is massively
expanding for memes. We're looking at

433
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,000
around about 150 to 170 billion dollar
market capitalization within a 3.8

434
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:25,000
trillion dollar crypto market.

435
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,000
That's three, four percent. I can see it
hitting a trillion that you're looking

436
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:35,000
around about maybe 10% market
capitalization. And if you look at Big

437
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Pepe, which I managed to get into pretty
early and really enjoyed sharing some of

438
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:43,000
those memes and jokes with my friends, and
it was a great laugh.

439
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
They can do really, really well. So I
think it's a bit of a... Sometimes it can

440
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,000
be a mistake to ignore them. I wish that I
bought way more Dogecoin back in 2017. God

441
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,000
damn it.

442
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Yeah, no, that's interesting.

443
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Yeah, go ahead, Tom.

444
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:05,000
To your point, you know, there's all
these things coming out and we enjoy the

445
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,000
memes. And I think everybody probably has
a favorite meme that they send. Yeah, I

446
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,000
know it's fun.

447
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:19,000
So I'm wondering, like, how do you how do
you judge which meme is going to do better

448
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:25,000
than the other? Is it like How clever is
the graphic? Is it the name? Is it timing?

449
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Is it all of those things?

450
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:36,000
How do you pick up on these social cues
that indicate a successful meme token? Or

451
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:41,000
is that just a little bit on the top, and
the rest of it is the tokenomics? Or is it

452
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:46,000
all of that? How do you think about it?

453
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:59,000
I think I look at meme coins in different
camps. Yeah, it's disgusting now, right?

454
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:11,000
That meme coin that comes out, that's a
flash in the pan.

455
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:17,000
This feels like an orchestrated team.
That's a cash grab. Like if you didn't see

456
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:22,000
that coming, then you just haven't been
around in the space long enough.

457
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Something like some other ones that have
done relatively well. Fart coin I saw a

458
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:34,000
few weeks ago. seem to be doing pretty
well. That for me is obscene.

459
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,000
It's not that funny. It's not that
meme-able. I want good meme-ability. I

460
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,000
want to be able to open my phone and
there'd be a huge collection of variety of

461
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,000
memes adapted by people that I can share
with my friends that are people in

462
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:51,000
different circumstances.

463
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:59,000
That's why I think Pepe was so strong.
and I think, I've said this, I think this

464
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:04,000
will be the major meme token of this cycle
because Pepe's hilarious.

465
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,000
You've got so many different, you've got
literally, open your phone, you put Pepe

466
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,000
farmer, you put Pepe fishing, you put Pepe
shooting, you put Pepe anything, and you

467
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,000
have many, many, many, many, many, many
memes that you can send.

468
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,000
I look at the cultural significance in
terms of, okay, what have these done? And

469
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:25,000
then I think about those ones, I suppose
I'm more interested in.

470
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:31,000
And then to be honest with you, I'm
looking at things like liquidity. So which

471
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:36,000
chain is this on? And if it's a new chain,
or if it's something coming.

472
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:41,000
So a matter that I'll share with you
guys, and I've spoken about it already,

473
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:45,000
but I'm really excited about Dogecoin meme
coins, because you've got Dogecoin is the

474
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:49,000
absolute number one meme coin in the
world.

475
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:54,000
It's undisputed. You have a whole fleet,
Dogecoin being the number one. I think

476
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:59,000
it's about a 25 million dollar market cap.
It's sat there as number one. It's about

477
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:04,000
to get integrated into MyDoge wallet.

478
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:10,000
which is essentially the largest Dogecoin
wallet. Every noob that you know has

479
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:15,000
bought Dogecoin back in 2017, 2018, 2019,
whatever.

480
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,000
So that is going to be a case of the easy
access to on-ramps liquidity into the

481
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,000
space. Those are the big winners. I'm not
necessarily, I'm not a meme coin trader.

482
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,000
I'm not on pump.fun.

483
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,000
I'm not interested in flash in the pan.
I'm looking at the big movers that are

484
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
gonna have cultural significance and are
gonna bring in liquidity and bring

485
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,000
community.

486
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,000
And I monitor things like X. I'm looking
at the number of hashtags and tweets that

487
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,000
these coins are getting, how long they've
been around for, looking at good

488
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
distribution. I'm looking at, okay, have
they even got listings yet? What are the

489
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
on-ramps for that?

490
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,000
There's a few things that go in there,
but I'd always say in investing generally

491
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,000
is that you just want to pick the big
winners and sit. That's my strategy with

492
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,000
meme coins tokens.

493
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Yeah, it's interesting. It's like meme
coins have this emergent property where

494
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:15,000
it's like, You know, like you're saying
these cultural aspects and now there's

495
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,000
this new emerging capability with like
blockchain and now tying value to the

496
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,000
specific meme itself.

497
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
And then, you know, and that's just kind
of fascinating. And then I love the idea

498
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,000
with respect to meme tokens and things
like that with the educational things to

499
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,000
where, you know, like you were just
talking about a little bit ago with like

500
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,000
the slippage and kind of understanding
that and,

501
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,000
You know, kind of bringing in as like an
on ramp to people to kind of facilitate

502
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
maybe a little bit of hopium right that
it's going to go up, but but also kind of

503
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,000
again, teaching them sort of the
fundamentals of like how to use a

504
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,000
decentralized exchange and then also
specifics of like kind of you were saying

505
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,000
like well.

506
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,000
you know, whether it's a token in
general, whether it's a meme token or just

507
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
generally, you know, well, what is the
market cap? What does liquidity look like?

508
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Because it might not be a meme token, it
could just be a regular utility token.

509
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:11,000
But you know, somebody might rug pull,
you know, and that's happened before. So

510
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:16,000
it's like, you know, in some aspects,
it's, it's a great, what's the word, like,

511
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:21,000
you know, just to kind of throw, not into
the fire, but crucible, right?

512
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Just put people into the arena, kind of
let them learn. Hopefully they make some

513
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
money out of it and don't, you know, get
too greedy in some aspects where they put

514
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
in like a bunch of money and then they
could just get, you know, extremely

515
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,000
rugged.

516
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:41,000
But I think it's a great way to kind of,
from an educational perspective, to kind

517
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:47,000
of facilitate and get more users within
you know the main chain Ergo in particular

518
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:53,000
and then as to why you know Ergo is kind
of cool you know compared to the other

519
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
yeah yeah yeah definitely i think more
and more people As they spend longer in

520
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,000
crypto, they look at altcoin token
distributions and they go, wait a minute.

521
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,000
So you've got all of these tokens for
founders, for teams, for all this sort of

522
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:09,000
stuff. And they become less enthusiastic
about it, I think, because you do have

523
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:13,000
these inevitable dumps and these
inevitable unlocks.

524
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
And there's a huge amount of access and
pre-seed rounds to early investors and all

525
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,000
these kinds of elements. And
realistically, you want something that's a

526
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,000
bit more open and sometimes and some
specific meme tokens and categories of

527
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,000
meme coins.

528
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:33,000
They are allowing and I think what you
said, Mark around that the emission

529
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,000
contract thesis would be a really great
idea as a great equalizer. I would also

530
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:41,000
say as well that if and when you do make
any money on meme coins, it's the funnest

531
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:45,000
money you've ever made in your life.

532
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:49,000
You know, you go out, you buy yourself a
watch. You're like, this is my frog watch.

533
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:53,000
This is my this, you know, like it's it's
funny, it's light-hearted, so I wouldn't

534
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:57,000
say it's a career choice, but it should
just be something on the side.

535
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Totally. And then I would say just, if
you don't mind sharing, you know, from

536
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:05,000
like a transparency perspective, you know,
the reason why I guess you do want to kind

537
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:09,000
of hide your identity, you know, is it
kind of the idea that's shrouded behind

538
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:13,000
like meme tokens and like, you know, you
don't want, you know, your business to be

539
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:17,000
associated with that per se, or is it
maybe more of like the blockchain type of

540
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:21,000
nature where people, you know, what, like,
why are you anonymous in that sense?

541
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Like, is it because of like, What do you
think?

542
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Well, to be pretty plain, I run a
professional services company and it's a

543
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:39,000
pretty serious business to be in with
serious clients and I am that person to

544
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:44,000
them and I've got guys that work with me
who rely on me to be like that.

545
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:51,000
This has always been an absolute passion
of mine but because that is my main

546
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:56,000
breadwinner, I can't overlap. I
potentially might lose credibility or

547
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:01,000
whatever. And then like I said about
people sort of dumping on, it takes two

548
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:06,000
minutes to write a negative Google review.

549
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,000
And again, it shouldn't be impacting
people. So that's part of the reason. I

550
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,000
also think that that there is, you know,
I'm Pepper to people on X and on Telegram

551
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,000
and nobody seems to have an issue with
that.

552
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:24,000
I think, you know, you bind to that
mystique essentially around it as well.

553
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:28,000
And it's just part of the narrative that
we have.

554
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Yeah, right. Well, if if you end up
getting fired over this, then you could

555
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,000
just you could just put all your money in
Pepper and it'll double for sure.

556
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Yeah, literally. I don't think I'll be
able to get it out, though.

557
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Yeah, right.

558
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Is there anything else you wanted to talk
about the project before we get to our

559
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:57,000
grand finale for this episode?

560
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Raffle, yeah, sure. Look, I think we've
covered quite a lot of ground. People

561
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:09,000
who've been following Pepper since the
start know that we

562
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:13,000
We started off, like I said, I was lying
on the sofa and I made this and people

563
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:17,000
from the community have reached out,
helped me devise economics, helped me

564
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:21,000
devise activities, competitions during a
30-day promo period.

565
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:27,000
More recently, we've got a yield farm, so
around about $30,000 large yield farm on

566
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:31,000
on Ergo we've got a really nice deep pool
around about fifty thousand dollars of

567
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:35,000
liquidity i've always said liquidity
liquidity liquidity it's all about

568
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:39,000
liquidity we want to make it nice and deep
for people to be able to come in and trade

569
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:43,000
and and not have these slippage problems

570
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:50,000
So that's been our ethos in terms of what
we're, I suppose what we're looking to do

571
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,000
is, you know, it's ultimately, I've been
an evangelist of Ergo, you'll see some of

572
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,000
the content that we put out on X and
Telegram.

573
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,000
We're always trying to educate people
about Ergo as much as we can do. and

574
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:08,000
ultimately our strategic positioning piece
as well is to reach out to Pepe, other

575
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Pepe community members in other chains,
bring them into Ergo, which we think is a

576
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,000
very good bulletproof blockchain and get
them excited about these concepts that

577
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:20,000
we've talked about, about the good things
about Ergo.

578
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:28,000
So we want to be ultimately here, right
front and center. So when we get a US

579
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:33,000
exchange listing, when we bring more
liquidity in through Rosen Bridge, then we

580
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:38,000
are amongst things like Comet and some of
the other main meme tokens to benefit from

581
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:43,000
it and make sure our earlier Ergo holders
benefit from it as well.

582
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:51,000
That's been our goal and that's what
we'll continue to do.

583
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,000
All right. Right on, brother. Thank you.
Any info about this raffle? I'm going to

584
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,000
share my screen and if you want to talk
about the raffle, what's it for? What are

585
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,000
you raffling?

586
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Yeah, sure. So we had a competition
around about the end of about a week ago.

587
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Oh, no, not a week, a couple of days ago,
might be a week from filming.

588
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Essentially, what this was, was this was
a snipe competition. To enter you had to

589
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:22,000
go on to MewFinance or any other DEX,
though I think MewFinance is great, so

590
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:27,000
shout out to Aco and HQx.

591
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:35,000
In terms of this raffle to qualify and to
win a lot, so there are eight groups of

592
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:41,000
lots. There is obviously 10 lots per
group. To qualify, you need to buy between

593
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:47,000
9,700 and 9,800 PepERG.

594
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:53,000
It drove some really great volume. People
were missing the pain in the game, as I

595
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:58,000
call it, because of slippage. But people
were essentially hitting some of those.

596
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:03,000
When they're hitting that margin, they
were winning that place. In terms of the

597
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:07,000
prizes, so for the first three lots for
early competitors, we said we're going to

598
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:11,000
give you a 40x your stake.

599
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:17,000
So everybody has effectively staked
$9,750 PepERG. and the winner of a raffle

600
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:21,000
will receive 40x for the first three
groups, and then 20x for the remaining

601
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:25,000
five groups.

602
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:33,000
That PepERG has come from our community
fund. We enjoy putting it back in the

603
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:40,000
community. People have been obviously
staying with PepERG and stuff like that.

604
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,000
It'd be great to get you guys to run the
raffle. Thanks so much for this. We can

605
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,000
talk through some of the winners.

606
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Yeah, no problem. Okay, so I'm just going
to run the number one through 10 for each

607
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:56,000
of these lots and I'll go through and
highlight the winning number.

608
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Yeah, slot.

609
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Alright, so here we go. First, first.

610
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Oh, just for context, people. So the
winner will receive 195. So for these 40x

611
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:11,000
slots, it's 390,000 PepERG, which I
believe is around about, I need to check

612
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:16,000
actually because of the exchange, but it's
a few hundred dollars, you know, this

613
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:21,000
isn't, it's maybe even a thousand dollars
actually.

614
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Should we just check what that is? Should
we just, let me just check. Because it's

615
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:34,000
not a small amount. And I think, We run
competitions with really good prizes.

616
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:40,000
We've got a 400 ERG prize pool for our
next comp, which is in ERG.

617
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,000
It's already there. And I think because
we've managed to boost our marketing and

618
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,000
treasury, just after my treasury
management, we've managed to get some of

619
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,000
these good funds.

620
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,000
So I'm looking forward to distributing
it. Let's just see how much it is. I'll

621
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,000
just work it out. So we've got at current
rates, obviously, everyone might have

622
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,000
changed.

623
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Now you're watching this. inevitably. So
we're looking at for the winners. We're

624
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:10,000
looking at for the winners of the first
three lots. It's about $760. So just over

625
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:15,000
400 ERG per winner and then around about
$380 for the remaining ones, which is

626
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:20,000
pretty cool.

627
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Sick. Yeah, nice. Decent price pools.

628
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Let's go. Let's let it rip.

629
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Yeah.

630
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Five.

631
00:49:50,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Number five.

632
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Four. Four. Nice.

633
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Nine FD. Yeah. Number four.

634
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:33,000
That'd be cool with some of your guys's
community funds. Maybe think about doing a

635
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:38,000
hackathon, you know, that's all based on
memes. You know what I mean?

636
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,000
And that's a great idea. Yeah. I would
love to do that. And I'd love to support

637
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,000
your idea about the emission piece because
I think that's brilliant.

638
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:49,000
That's why we pay you the big bucks,
Mark. Great idea.

639
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:53,000
So these three winners from the 40X
stake, it's great, they're all different

640
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:57,000
addresses, which I'm pleased about. So
thanks for committing everybody in those

641
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:01,000
first three.

642
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:07,000
Yeah, Tim actually made random.org and
these are all his addresses.

643
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,000
Number one.

644
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Okay, great guys. So we've got HGPZZ.
Okay, winner of last one with a 40x stake.

645
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Okay, so you won again two lots in a row.
Pretty impressive. That's a total that you

646
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:28,000
know you've managed to he's managed to net
600 equivalent PepERG.

647
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Number one, nine FAD. So look at that
guy. Did he win the first lot?

648
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
He won this one here.

649
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Okay. So we got We've got some big
winners there.

650
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:52,000
OK. And what's the origin of Pepe? Kind
of just like it's an entirety. Like, I'm

651
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:57,000
not too familiar with like, I mean,
obviously, I know the meme and, you know,

652
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:02,000
I'll go on like Instagram and things like
that and, you know, see the frog guys and

653
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:07,000
stuff. But like, where did it originate?

654
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Yeah, sure. So we It originated around
about in the mid-2000s. I think Matt Fury

655
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:23,000
was a comic developer and author. He
created it and then kind of hit mainstream

656
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:31,000
attention and then it kind of then became
a little bit controversial, I believe.

657
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:40,000
It got used by some right groups. It just
gained kind of internet notoriety

658
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:49,000
specifically through Reddit. It came into
crypto actually. So there are rare Pepe

659
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:58,000
trading cards. They're like, they go for
about a thousand bucks, a hundred thousand

660
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:07,000
bucks each on Ethereum.

661
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:24,000
Cool.

662
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:30,000
And people were missing it by like one or
they'll go a bit early. And it was great.

663
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Someone netted it and they won 420,000
PepERG. And they haven't dumped it.

664
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,000
I think that just shows to be honest with
you that people realize what is coming and

665
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,000
they're enjoying it and they want to get
positioned well. So, you know, if we can

666
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,000
help people do that, then let's do it.

667
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Yeah. All right. Well, congrats to all
the winners. PepERG, thanks for joining

668
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:53,000

00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,000
us generally. So appreciate it, man.

670
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:02,000

And let's keep in touch. Absolutely. And

671
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:06,000
let's see where all this goes. And I think
the ErgoHack is a great idea. So let's

672
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:10,000
pick up on that in the future, too.

673
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Yeah, do some digging, come up with some
ideas on how you wanna do that and maybe

674
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,000
you can come on the podcast and announce
it if that's what you guys end up wanting

675
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:20,000
to do.

676
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Yeah, it could be interesting for sure.
Yeah, thanks for that. Cool.

677
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
