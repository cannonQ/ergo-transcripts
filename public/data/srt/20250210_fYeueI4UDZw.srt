1
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Hello and welcome to a late night solo
dev update.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I'm qx() and I will guide you through the
ASMR developer update on the Ergo

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
platform.

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
We'll tone it down more once we get to
the actual updates.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
And excuse my voice, still recovering
after a full month of being sick from

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
before, so working on that.

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
OK, so you'll notice what I have up on
screen here first is before the Dev Update

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
started, kushti and Unreal and on 2020's
mgPai, Luivatra are discussing the

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
SigmaUSD bank update.

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
So currently in the stages, Unreal, I
believe, is testing against testnet some

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
UI updates for it.

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I wanted to jump in here because I see in
chat sometimes people are trying to

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
convert the SigmaUSD, a SigmaRSV, convert
back when they're confused about why the

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
price is different, perhaps, on MewFinance
or MewDex or Spectrum DEX compared to the

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
SigmaUSD bank or even TokenJ, which some
people don't even know about and how that

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
works.

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
So there's an amazing video that I spoke
with cafe and he explains that I'll put

18
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
that in the chat below.

19
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
If I remember, if it's not too late, if
not just Google it, it's on the Ergo

20
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
platform channel or the Sigmanauts
channel, I believe it was a dev update.

21
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:59,000
So it should be the Ergo YouTube channel,
but let's kick off here, right here.

22
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,000
So we have two different kinds. The first
kind.

23
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
The first way we can do it is we can go
to sigmausd.io.

24
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Now the difference between sigmausd.io,
the difference between tokenj and the

25
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
difference between doing an exchange is
very simple, all right?

26
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:28,000
If you're trying to convert ERGs to
SigmaUSD or SigmaUSD or SigmaRSV to ERGs,

27
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:36,000
back the other way, you can at any time go
to something like MewFinance, choose ERGs,

28
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Choose SigmaUSD.

29
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And we can convert it anytime. We'll have
some slippage, of course.

30
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
We'll have a price impact because this is
an actual pool that people have created

31
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
and created liquidity for it.

32
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
So we're limited by the depth of the
liquidity. We're limited by the trades

33
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
that are going on in it right then as
well.

34
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
So you'll notice that the DEX price of
SigmaUSD slash ERG, that conversion rate,

35
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
will sometimes lag behind and be different
than the actual price of what ERG is.

36
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
So there's arbitrage opportunities
between here if you have SigmaUSD or you

37
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
have ERG because you can slide into one
and slide in the other.

38
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
If the DEX gets too far up ahead of what
the bank is, you can bring it back down.

39
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
If it gets too far below, you can buy it
back up.

40
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Exactly like that.

41
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Super, super easy beginner method of
arbitrage you can start with the SigmaUSD

42
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
bank versus the DEX to level those out.

43
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,000
OK, that being said, that's the DEX side
of things. We also have, back to these two

44
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:47,000
dashboards, we have a difference between
these two actual processes as well.

45
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
TokenJ, I'm not sure which one was around
first. Actually, I think it was SigmaUSD.

46
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Right here, the SigmaUSD.io, perhaps.
Somebody can correct me if I'm wrong.

47
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
This uses proxy contracts. That means
your funds are sent into a proxy contract

48
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
first, and then it is pushed against the
bank itself, the bank contract, and you

49
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
are given your tokens.

50
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
If something happens, there is a refund
button that you can do.

51
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
So let's say we go to a stable coin. We
choose to go from ERG to SigmaUSD or

52
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
SigmaUSD to ERG.

53
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Or we want to do the reserve coin, ERG to
SigmaRSV, SigmaRSV to ERG.

54
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
We purchase, we redeem.

55
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
goes into the proxy if the price of ERG
hasn't changed your funds will be in that

56
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
proxy and then you can refund them if it
hasn't gone through otherwise you'll get

57
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
your conversion tokenj on the other hand
does it a little differently

58
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
they directly go right to the bank.

59
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
So there's no delay, there's no extra
slippage or anything like that.

60
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
If your bid matches it, then it's going
to execute. If it doesn't, then it doesn't

61
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
and you get it back automatically,
essentially.

62
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
So that's kind of the difference between
these two products right here.

63
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:17,000
They both interact directly with the
contract, the SigmaUSD contract.

64
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Now you may say, we can see reserve ratio
at 374%. What does that mean?

65
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
If we go over to here from the Ergo
platform website, we can see a cute little

66
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
infographic about when you can purchase or
redeem.

67
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:41,000
So if it's below 400%, we can only redeem
the USD or we can only purchase SigmaRSV.

68
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
If it's above 800%, we can only redeem
SigmaRSV. We can purchase and redeem both

69
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
SigmaUSD.

70
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
So that is like the logic built in to the
process of the protocol that keeps that

71
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
thing pegged where it's supposed to be.

72
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
If you want to get deeper on this part
and go into more arbitrage opportunities

73
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
and potentially gain opportunities with
minting and unminting SigmaRSV, SigmaUSD,

74
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
please watch that video I spoke about
earlier.

75
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Cafe does a fantastic job of explaining
it. It's tricky. It's tricky. I don't

76
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
touch this anymore.

77
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
But there's a lot of people who do. And
there's a lot of misconceptions about RSV

78
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
being a long or that kind of thing.

79
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
watch that video that'll hopefully
explain a lot.

80
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
So if we test this, right, a reserve
ratio below 400, we should not be able to

81
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
purchase SigmaUSD at anywhere, right?

82
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:42,000
So let's see if I want one. Let's see.

83
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
See, unable, if you can read this, you
can barely read this. Unable to mint more

84
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
than zero SigmaUSD based on the current
reserve status.

85
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
It won't let us if you want to redeem.
Sure enough, it lets us redeem and that

86
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
matches exactly what this chart says.

87
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
So both of these are codified to match
the contract and the contract won't. So

88
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
somebody tries to bypass these UIs and
interact with the bank directly.

89
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Won't do it. Won't do it at all. It's all
based on the smart contract code.

90
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I'll put that video below, but watch it.
I know this is asked a lot in chat

91
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
sometimes when people are struggling with
what this is.

92
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Sometimes people click on version one of
SigmaUSD, which you don't want to use. You

93
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
want to use the main link from the
SigmaUSD page or tokenj of course.

94
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
And I know a lot of you people already
know this already, but I think it's good

95
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
to have out there once again, because it
is a question asked very often.

96
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:42,000
All right, we've got a very, very short
dev update this week. We're gonna try to

97
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:50,000
keep this under 15 minutes. I think we can
do it.

98
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Let's see if I have any voice left.

99
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:01,000
We have Anand Bihar from the Nautilus
team. And they have released version 0.2.0

100
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:07,000
of Ergo Ledger JS, added device close app,
device open app, and device get current

101
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:13,000
app info, OS level methods, improved APDU
logging.

102
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Nautilus, refactored ledger device
component, moving all generic and state

103
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
management logic into it, refactored
transaction sign component, refactored

104
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
confirm address dialogue component, added
several minor UI fixes and code quality

105
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
improvements.

106
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
This is good. I haven't been paying
attention to this in chats or what they

107
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
were saying, but I imagine this comes from
the latest ask to fix some things perhaps

108
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
review they were doing so that's great.

109
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Awesome. It'll be nice to have both
ledger and keystone options again, so

110
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
people have choice. That's always best.

111
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
All right, we have C8 with ErgFi, Dexy
Gold integration, ETA a few weeks. I see

112
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
it's usually pretty good with the
deadlines. So yeah, I believe that.

113
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
He's done five to five lib level actions,
LP swap, ERG-Dexy Gold, bank freemint,

114
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
bank redeem, LP mint liquidity tokens, LP
redeem liquidity tokens, in-progress UI

115
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
integration, ErgoPay, other things
required for release, mempool server

116
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
integration.

117
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Very nice.

118
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,000
We have kushti with sub-blocks, which
people love to pass around as the next big

119
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
thing, which I think it is. It's going to
be amazing.

120
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:38,000
We spoke briefly about changing or at
least coming up with some sort of

121
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:44,000
alternative to an ErgoHack, like a spring
or summer of code where essentially you

122
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:50,000
target a theme and you get people on
board, you give them much more time.

123
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
So for example, HQx mentioned, why don't
we do a spring of code or summer of code

124
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,000
that is focused on prepping dApps for
sub-blocks.

125
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
So by the time sub-blocks come out, if
you've done this spring of code and you've

126
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
rewarded people that are participating in
that and learning ErgoScript and learning

127
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
how to code, and also people that come and
knowing how to do front ends and work with

128
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
code anyway,

129
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
A lot of these dApps that we have in here
will already be set for sub-blocks when it

130
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
comes online.

131
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
So that's the idea of that kind of spring
of code versus an ErgoHack where you give

132
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
a theme and people do it and you reward
based on that.

133
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I feel in kind of these code sessions
where it's extended, you target college

134
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
groups, you target other ecosystem
developers as well as our own.

135
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Everybody comes together for kind of a
goal and they're rewarded based on the

136
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
stages. Might get a little more progress
with these kinds of things.

137
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Okay, great. So sub-blocks work and DAG
representation of input and ordering

138
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
blocks and RAM after completing first API
methods, best input block, best input

139
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
chain with just one local miner chain
representation is okay for initial

140
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
testing, et cetera.

141
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
But for P2P network, DAG storage is
needed.

142
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:09,000
6.0.0 RC to released with support for
public testnet or voting and activation

143
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:16,000
voting should be started soon in the
testnet next 120 blocks epic epoch.

144
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,000
So yeah, so he gave me a couple of days
after that released, I popped it on the

145
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
testnet I'm running the testnet and change
the code and immediately popped up that

146
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,000
said, 120 blocks for epic.

147
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:38,000
So should be soon. Super cool. It's
running, I believe, as I said earlier, and

148
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Unreal was testing some UI things for,
what was it? SigmaUSD.

149
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:51,000
So that's great that that's working.
Waiting for 6.0 fix PRs review.

150
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
But Paideia. Oh, nice. But Paideia. This
is Luivatra worked with CannonQ to debug

151
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
some issues in the create DAO process.

152
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I tell you guys if you haven't used
Paideia. I mean, even if you just have

153
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
groups online of people that you work with
for fun, like D&D groups or record groups

154
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
or music groups or anything like that,
where there are decisions that need to be

155
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
made that are based around user consensus,
and you could potentially have funds

156
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
hooked to that too, it's the way to go.

157
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
It's worked amazingly well. We used the
hell out of it during the beta. For

158
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Sigmanauts, the mining pool just jumped
over there as well, from the beta to the

159
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
final version that we're on as well for
the Sigmanauts.

160
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
It's an amazing tool. Hats off to
Luivatra, Marty, and the team that worked

161
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
on that. Fantastic.

162
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
We've got kushti with SigmaUSD pool.
Prepare data for mainnet pool update to

163
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
refresh update box and open possibility to
update the pool to V2 and next voting,

164
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
ChainCash, updating the paper.

165
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
We've got Voryu Jack with Minotaur.
Select addresses from the address book.

166
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Allow to archive some wallets. These
wallets are not displayed in wallet select

167
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
page by default.

168
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Favorite wallets are displayed in start
of wallets list. Great, great. Toggle

169
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
display archive wallet.

170
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
If you guys are interested in running
desktop versions of wallet, Ergo has too

171
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
many good choices. It's absolutely
fantastic.

172
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
You have Minotaur, you have Satergo, but
give them a try. I have many computers

173
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
that I use and I have Satergo on one.

174
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I have Minotaur on another. I have
Minotaur Mobile on my, where is it? I love

175
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
showing this thing off.

176
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Show it off every other AMA on my cold
wallet, which is just one of these little

177
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,000
palms.

178
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
When I bought it, it was like a hundred
and, I think I got it for 70 bucks. Now

179
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
it's a lot more where it was last time I
checked a little tiny guy running Android.

180
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,000
It's my cold wallet. Got Minotaur on it.
I push things to it via ADB cable as a

181
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,000
text file to sign things on the cold
wallet and push them back.

182
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Super, super cool.

183
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,000
We've got an update from Rosen Bridge.
This is very exciting.

184
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Rosen Bridge-RosenApp. Enhance the
logical structure of networks within their

185
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
specific packages to improve efficiency
and increase maintainability.

186
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Implementing public event status or
services.

187
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Rosen Bridge watcher version two. Write
observation-related queries and write unit

188
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
tests.

189
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Write a job function and txpot and
callback of it.

190
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Rosen Bridge Scanner added callback
support to extractors, added abstract

191
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
database entity in action to ease the new
extractors development.

192
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Rosen Bridge Utils added callback logger
package to be used in log level health

193
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
parameter.

194
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:55,000
If any of you are being a watcher on the
Rosen Bridge, I had to do some sort of

195
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:02,000
database wipe on mine. I had to kill the
containers and redo it.

196
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
There's an issue with one of the packages
when you restart it. They're working on

197
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
fixing the instructions to include an
official repository to one of those

198
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
packages, because it's a third party
package.

199
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I found one built into Docker that works.
I've been using it for three or four days

200
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
now. It works fine.

201
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
But there'll be an official announcement
that soon if they haven't already based on

202
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
this. So if you do find yourself in
trouble spinning up a watcher from scratch

203
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
right now, or rebuilding your container,
so then you're going to run into that

204
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
unless you do that fix.

205
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Feel free to ping me or somebody in the
chats.

206
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Oh, kushti is calling me out. I didn't
even answer that. Goodness, why we only

207
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
have 176 blocks a day in the testnet with
min difficulty. Any idea?

208
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Probably because I'm only mining it at
like two megahash. Maybe I'll hit it with

209
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:58,000
a better card that's more consistent or
something like that.

210
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Whoopsie. We'll answer him later. Sorry,
kushti.

211
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Rosen Bridge continued. Rosen Bitcoin
ruins R&D. The research on integration

212
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Bitcoin ruins with the Rosen Bridge is now
complete.

213
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Over the past few weeks, we explored
various APIs and libraries to assess the

214
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
feasibility of this integration and how to
align the implementation with our overall

215
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
design detailed in a dedicated medium
post.

216
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Despite encountering some concerns and
regarding rate limits associated with

217
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
certain APIs, we have decided to proceed
with the implementation phase.

218
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
As we develop the integration, we will
gather more accurate estimations, allowing

219
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
us to make informed decisions for
potential improvements along the way.

220
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Currently, we are finalizing the
documentation and proof of concepts, and

221
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
we are looking forward to starting to
develop that development phase in the near

222
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
future.

223
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:54,000
This, I mean, this is awesome. Anytime
you can, not just in Bitcoin, but anytime

224
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,000
you can bring a store value over to
another chain like Ergo and get some

225
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,000
functionality of it, out of it, that's
more Cardano or to Ethereum or to where's

226
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,000
the next one, Binance, and get some more
utility or usage out of it.

227
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
It's a no brainer.

228
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I think once people cross the bridge once
and they're like, oh, this is how it

229
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
works. I can see it all along the process.

230
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I don't see a spot where it ever gets
lost or anything like that. I can see

231
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
exactly what's happening, if it's
processing, if it's in payment.

232
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I think they get a little more
comfortable with it. So we just got to get

233
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
people out of that initial hump.

234
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:40,000
OK, kushti's talking about merging and
releasing some things.

235
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Anything else?

236
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
They're updating an Ergo node interface
for us there.

237
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Oh, Fanta created a new front end for
index nodes.

238
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:00,000
This stuff is exciting. OK, so right now,
we have the Ergo Explorer, the main one.

239
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:13,000
That's this one.

240
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
This is what I'm looking for. The main
Ergo Explorer right here.

241
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:24,000
This is not fun to set up.

242
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,000
It's not fun to set up at all. I created
a package for myself, and it's zipped up.

243
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Essentially, you just put it onto the
server, update some DNS and nginx things

244
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
and you're good to go.

245
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
But it's not for the everyday person,
right? It's got some clunky overhead, and

246
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
it just keeps eating and eating and eating
space on your computer.

247
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Well, I mean, so does a node, but not not
as much.

248
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:54,000
So you have things like erg explore,
which is an alternative, you have sigma

249
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,000
space as well, which is an alternative, a
fantastic, all fantastic, great, but

250
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
To be able to create a front end for an
index node, we all know how easy nodes are

251
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
to install, right?

252
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
With Satergo, it's like one click. Even
with a Java file, if you're not familiar,

253
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
you can barge your way through it, making
a config file and running the jar.

254
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
That's fantastic. But imagine just
running a UI just by a Docker container,

255
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
probably.

256
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,000
And all of a sudden you have a front end
that you can kind of understand and learn.

257
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,000
And it's yourself. It's hosted by
yourself. It's easy to set up.

258
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
These kind of things are like, this is
what makes a difference, right? For

259
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
usability for these kind of things. So
absolutely fantastic.

260
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:49,000
And let's see. Anything else?

261
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I think that's it, folks.

262
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
There's some tech support chat in here.

263
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Oh, Mark's looking for, this is a day or
two later, but he's looking for some Ergo

264
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:06,000
developers for building Sharknet. It's on
the Sigmanauts mining DAO.

265
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,000
If you're mining, if you have one GPU,
you want to point it, please, please

266
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
support it. Hop in there.

267
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I think that's about it.

268
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Yeah, we're several days ahead. They
definitely missed. Perfect.

269
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,000
All right, everybody. I hope you had a
good week. If you were in the United

270
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,000
States of America, you had your big Super
Bowl game a few hours ago.

271
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I hope the team that you enjoy won or
you're not too sad that the other one

272
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
lost.

273
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I watch some commercials. It's OK. The
game's somewhat all right. I didn't even

274
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
know the Super Bowl was happening until a
couple days ago.

275
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
That's how out of it I've been.

276
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:58,000
So we'll see you on Thursday for a video
AMA.

277
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I've been thinking about putting together
a pool so that we could vote and bet on

278
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
who's going to show up to host the AMA.

279
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,000
So we'll give like five or six people and
what's it called?

280
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
And you send, you can send like a token,
a specific tokens to the wallet that's

281
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
worth some sort of value.

282
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
And whoever is right, that wallet, the
percentage of people that gave that you

283
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
gave,

284
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
You take all the other wallets and you
combine them and your percentage gets a

285
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
pull out of everything.

286
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
So essentially, if you win, you get from
all the other wallets that people voted on

287
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
a percentage that you donated to the
winning wallet.

288
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
So I think that'd be kind of fun,
something like that. Those are easier to

289
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
do with wallet voting and a transaction
builder.

290
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Oh, almost forgot during the Town Hall
last week, I spoke about the Cornell BRICK

291
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
token.

292
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:59,000
That's doing great. We've distributed
maybe 30 or so interested wallets so far.

293
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
There's about 350, 400 architecture kids
ago. There's 800 students in total.

294
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
So slow burn, but that's fine. Once it
spreads, you can get free printing from

295
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,000
these initial tokens.

296
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I think it's going to start slowly
catching more fire.

297
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
But we had several students use the
system already to actually redeem free

298
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
prints. So that was super exciting to see.

299
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,000
OK, everybody, thanks for bearing with my
chunky voice. This week, hopefully, after

300
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,000
my meds, next week will be a little
clearer.

301
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Thanks, everybody, for watching. Have a
great night.
