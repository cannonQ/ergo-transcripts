1
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Hey, everyone, how's it going?

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Good morning, everybody.

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
How you doing, kushti?

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Doing well, busy days despite summer but
yeah it's going really well so delivering

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:42,000
a lot and just like two minutes ago 6.0
RC6 released hopefully the latest release

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:51,000
candidate version, which is different from
the final release in regards with

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:01:00,000
maintenance warning height.

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
But yeah, so we are doing some additional
testing. So let's see. But yeah, well,

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
it's hopefully final.

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Should we push that and test that?

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Then what else? So yeah, well, Sigma 6.0
released and well, I've published some

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:28,000
texts, I believe. I don't know whether I
made anything public, but yeah, we've

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:35,000
written a lot of stuff also recently. If
it's not public yet, then yeah, it will be

15
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:42,000
made so in coming days.

16
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:52,000
So, yeah, then there are some things I'm
preparing under the hood. Yes, some will

17
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:02,000
be announced soon and some probably close
to September, so finalizing conference

18
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:12,000
schedule. So, yeah, well, in September, I
will visit Korean Blockchain Week. So,

19
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:22,000
yeah, currently making some arrangements
with Korean peers.

20
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:29,000
And yeah, also, I will be in Dubai in
July, surprisingly. Yeah, I hope I'll

21
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:36,000
survive. So if everyone will be around in
July, not sure about that. So yeah, let's

22
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:43,000
meet maybe.

23
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:52,000
So yeah, a lot of updates and yeah, it
seems community is quite buzzing these

24
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:01,000
days again, right? So a lot of
conversations and so on. Some new faces in

25
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:10,000
the developer's chats and yeah, actually,
there are some new faces in the developers

26
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:19,000
chat, some brought by Bruno because he has
a couple of Google Summer of Code projects

27
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:28,000
bringing new contributors to existing and
new projects.

28
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:36,000
And yeah, well, aside of that, there are
some new faces as well. And yeah, well, a

29
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:43,000
lot of interesting things going on.

30
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Yeah, we have some, the hackathon brought
on some people that aren't even really

31
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
normal developers, you know, everyday
developers. So with the AI themed, it's

32
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
not just, remember, it's not just AI
themed, as in let's work with AI in the

33
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
blockchain. It's also let's utilize AI
tools to help create and build something

34
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
for Ergo, for the hackathon.

35
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
So you'll notice that I think Mark got
two Sigmanauts mining pool miners to build

36
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
some apps as well in the hackathon. So
those are completely new people testing

37
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
the DevWaters with the augmentation of AI.
So that was really, really good to see.

38
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And I'm scanning through the entries in
the Discord. If you guys have the time,

39
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
swing into the Discord and Glasgow's got
them all listed there right under, right

40
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
near the general chat. You'll see
everybody's hackathon project and you'll

41
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
see the submissions and there's a lot of
working examples that you can click on and

42
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
actually use their product.

43
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
So if you want to participate in, we're
working on doing a community vote as well,

44
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
like we do every time. So there'll be, we
just have to vote on that in the

45
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Sigmanauts. So there'll be a reward for
community voted projects on the hackathon.

46
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
That's neat because, you know, you have
the hackathon requirements which are

47
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
awarded by the EF and then you have
community projects where we can use

48
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
different metrics and standards to rank
and grade and have you vote on. So it

49
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
gives everybody more of a chance at the
uniqueness of their project to perhaps

50
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
receive a reward for their efforts.

51
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
But there's a lot of cool stuff. kushti,
did you take a peek at some of the

52
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
hackathon final projects that came out?

53
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Yeah, well, watched probably, so all of
them published over the Ergo platform

54
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Twitter. So, yeah, well, it's quite
interesting what people are doing with AI

55
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:52,000
and Ergo. So I'm also trying to use AI,
but... For testing, right?

56
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
You use it for running test examples?

57
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,000
To write tests, so some trivial code, but
yeah, so I tried to write down some

58
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,000
sub-blocks related algorithms
implementation. Yeah, it seems, well, it's

59
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:14,000
about, you know, some pretty dangerous
hallucinations. So yeah, I found, well,

60
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,000
it's probably more productive to write
codes manually, right, than to get through

61
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,000
reviewing AI-generated code with some
subtle issues, but they're actually quite

62
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:32,000
critical ones.

63
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Right, right. It gets very difficult. I
find that if I write something from

64
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
scratch and something goes wrong, it's so
much easier to debug it as opposed to

65
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
having AI spit out an entire app, and then
you're literally going through the app as

66
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
if somebody else wrote it because they did
and you're kind of learning and figuring

67
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
it out. It takes much, much longer to bug,
debug and troubleshoot an AI app as

68
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
opposed to writing your own code.

69
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
But that being said, I think I said this
last week, I can't remember if I said it

70
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
in a Sigmanauts meeting or an AMA, but
I'll say it again. The interfacing with

71
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Ergo platform, kushti, when I use AI to
code, or even when I don't, it's the easy

72
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
part. It's insane how easy it is to
interface with the tooling and the

73
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
blockchain, the node, the explorer, all
the API endpoints. So easy. The hard part

74
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
is the actual app itself.

75
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
So I always find myself wrapping up the
endpoints and how I'm going to interact

76
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
with the chain, and that's done super
quick. And then the rest of the time is

77
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
spent trying to get the damn front end to
work properly or the back end and that

78
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
kind of stuff. So it's really nice to be
on a chain where integrating with a

79
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
blockchain is not the issue ever, usually.

80
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:58,000
It would be interesting to get into some
high-level definition of financial

81
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:06,000
contracts using templates, contract
templates we have in Ergo. AI, so probably

82
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:14,000
then not so much, you know, freedom for AI
to get here into its hallucination, so it

83
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:22,000
would be quite interesting, and yeah,
well, results should be solved, but yeah,

84
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:30,000
well, we need to do some things, but yeah,
well, there are some MCP efforts for

85
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:38,000
getting LLMs working with ErgoScript and
yeah, I haven't tried them yet, to be

86
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:46,000
honest, I need to do.

87
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:59,000
But yeah, so what's great about AI, you
can do some trivial things like tests,

88
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:06,000
right? So when you have like five tests
already and I need to do like five new

89
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:13,000
ones with just different conditions for
inputs and outputs, then yeah, well, it's

90
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:20,000
saving hours, right, easily.

91
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:29,000
So, well, you can do copy-paste, right,
and then going through hundreds of lines

92
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:36,000
of code to find those conditions and save
them, and it's quite boring, and AI is

93
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:43,000
reducing efforts heavily there. So yeah,
that's great, and also using AI for now,

94
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:50,000
well, writing some proposals, right, but
it's not I think quite useful to use its

95
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:57,000
output right to just hide in our code
space and send like some people are doing

96
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:04,000
but yeah yeah yeah well you can prompt and
then get some structured ideas right and

97
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:11,000
then just fill your document but actually
with your own wording because well AI is

98
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:18,000
too kind of lengthy and

99
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Double explains things, double reasons
things. It's fairly somewhat obvious at

100
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
this point still, especially if you're in
correspondence with a person already. I

101
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
got an email the other day from somebody.
They were requesting something. It was a

102
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
couple of paragraphs long. And I wrote
them back on Teams. And I was like, did

103
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
you put this through AI to make this
request? And they're like, yeah. I was

104
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
like, ugh. So it can be pretty obvious
sometimes.

105
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's too wordy usually,
right? Too much water and sometimes also

106
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:04,000
some hallucinations there.

107
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,000
What's your tool you go to when you do
use AI? Is it ChatGPT or Claude or

108
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,000
something else?

109
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:22,000
So for text, it's just DeepSeek. So,
yeah, it's free and it's... You want me to

110
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:29,000
click? No, just the websites. They have
this quite interesting reasoning mode,

111
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:36,000
which is quite funny sometimes. But yeah,
I'm not using it heavily, so it's just, I

112
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:43,000
don't know, maybe once a week, once a
month, something like that.

113
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:55,000
And for all codes I'm using, yeah, Claude
Sonnet and Cursor IDE. Also tried IntelliJ

114
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:04,000
IDEA with its own AI assistant, so it's
front-end. So many back-ends, I believe,

115
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:13,000
such as Sonnet, DeepSeek and so on, but
yeah, it's not working so well for me at

116
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:22,000
least. It's quite interesting but also
quite limited.

117
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,000
You need to be inventive to bypass the
limitations, to boost your productivity

118
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,000
and not to have it downgraded.

119
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Yeah, no, no, exactly. When I was coding
with Mark and Kenan for the hackathon, the

120
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,000
tools were using OpenWebUI and LiteLLM.
There's a certain way you can get them to

121
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,000
kind of talk to each other. And the AI
platforms I was using really thought it

122
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,000
knew how it worked, and it did not. And I
find myself arguing with it at 2 a.m. and

123
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I was like, what am I doing? Just stop
wasting your time and just write the damn

124
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:04,000
thing yourself.

125
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,000
So that's what you end up doing, but you
get to that threshold and you're like,

126
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,000
okay, this thing obviously thinks it knows
what it's talking about, but it obviously

127
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,000
doesn't. So I think that can be dangerous
to somebody who doesn't know what they're

128
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,000
doing and it's gonna waste a lot of their
time.

129
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:31,000
All right, and yeah, so a lot of things
going on around, right? There was some

130
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:37,000
buzz on Twitter in regards with Kaspa
integration into Rosen Bridge and Tari.

131
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Right, that'll be great, yeah.

132
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Well, as far as I know, both are now
communicating with the Rosen team.

133
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I just hope that people can really get
over this siloed approach of tribalism,

134
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
right? I think we see that again. I saw
that on Twitter the other day when Kaspa

135
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
was posting about somebody's posting about
Kaspa joining Rosen Bridge and something

136
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
and somebody posted from Kaspa about how
much better Kaspa is and that kind of

137
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
thing. And I had to switch off the main
account, switch to my own account and make

138
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
kind of a not terrible comment to them,
but just a reminder that there's no need

139
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
to beat your chest about this kind of
stuff. Like, come on, bud.

140
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
It's just such a waste of effort to see
that happen. There's no need for tribalism

141
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
in that sense. Especially when Ergo is
better than everybody else, kushti, you

142
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
know?

143
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Right, but also, I mean, so you know, if
there is news about, you know, integration

144
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:46,000
with some centralized exchange, so no one
would say that, I don't know, like Kaspa

145
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:54,000
is better than Binance. I mean, it's
similar. Yeah, true, true. I mean, Rosen

146
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Bridge is just application. So yeah, so
it's in the same field as centralized

147
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:10,000
exchanges, right? Not chains. So I mean,
what's the point to start a holy war here?

148
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Talking about centralized exchanges,
they're disgusting. I'm not sure what's

149
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:27,000
bad they did in the last days since the
last AMA, but I'm pretty sure they've

150
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:35,000
committed to a lot of nasty things as
usually. Like, I don't know, launched 100

151
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:43,000
meme scams from their own department labs
and so on. Just every day they're doing

152
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:51,000
some pretty disgusting stuff.

153
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
All right, so do we have Dan now?

154
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
We have Dan the Man Freed Man.

155
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Wow.

156
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Wow. And you're talking about doing
disgusting stuff. What did you do QX? What

157
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:11,000
was that? What happened? We talked about
this already. We talked about the stuff.

158
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
It's great to see you, Dan. I've missed
you since last week. What's new in Palm

159
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Economy, Dan? How's it going there?

160
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:27,000
You know, it's going all right. There's a
lot of palms. A lot of palms. Yeah. A lot

161
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:34,000
of palms. Actually, Theo just came back
from Africa, from Nigeria. And so we are

162
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:41,000
going to be onboarding cocoa and
pineapples.

163
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Nice.

164
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Two of my favorite things. Yeah, yeah.
Cocoa and pineapples. I said cocoa, not

165
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:58,000
coke. But unlike when you see these are
pineapples, not pinecones, which is

166
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:06,000
probably, you know, what some people call
you. Now, pineapples over there, they

167
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:14,000
apparently have a problem with... Well, so
the supply chain has a problem with

168
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:22,000
standardization, so they don't have agreed
on standards and QA for these pineapples.

169
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:29,000
There's actually a photo that Theo took,
that he took in, I'm not sure if it was

170
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Benin or Nigeria, it was either Nigeria or
Benin. I think it was Benin, actually,

171
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:41,000
where they literally throw away like some
ridiculous amount, like 30% or something

172
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:47,000
like that, just because they can't
standardize it.

173
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,000
So this is actually one of the reasons
why they're so interested in Palmer Pro is

174
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:00,000
because it'll help them track the entire
process so that they can do QA a lot

175
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,000
better, as well as other things that are
needed for soft commodities operations to

176
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,000
keep track of stocks, keep track of
growth, processing, and all these

177
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,000
different things.

178
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:24,000
So, yeah, there's a lot of interest
there. And also, in Nigeria, the cacao

179
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:33,000
trade. I don't know if people know about
this, but cacao is chocolate, and people

180
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:42,000
know chocolate. Well, chocolate is
actually, there's quite a lot of shady

181
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:51,000
shit happening with cacao because of the
various different regions and middlemen

182
00:18:51,000 --> 00:19:00,000
between, say, the west where a lot of this
is used and a lot of the African countries

183
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:09,000
that produce this cacao, some are actually
government-controlled monopolies. Some of

184
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:18,000
them are actually suppressed.

185
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,000
There's a lot of well, not a lot, but in
some regions, there's a lot of

186
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:28,000
manipulation going on. And so what that
does is it actually creates real

187
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,000
inequality about the cacao farmer, what
they get versus what this stuff is sold

188
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,000
for. And actually, the prices of cacao,
are you paying attention, QX? What are you

189
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,000
looking at? Somebody giving you a treat?
You look like a Doberman that's about to

190
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:48,000
get a treat.

191
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I put you up on this big screen over
here, Dan. I have like three huge screens

192
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
in front of me. I have like a whole
console.

193
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Don't put me up on a pedestal, okay?
You're already like 5'3". You don't have

194
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,000
to. Keep going about like a cow. Yeah, the
cacao, the cocoa. Yeah, and so the

195
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:10,000
international prices of cacao actually are
going up. It's getting more and more

196
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,000
expensive. But that really does not
translate to the producer. And a lot of it

197
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:20,000
is because lack of market access,
gatekeeping, and also lack of quality

198
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,000
control and assurance mechanisms.

199
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:36,000
And so again, that's something that we're
going to be providing for them through

200
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Palmyra is those mechanisms through
Palmyra Pro using tokenization and

201
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:48,000
basically track and trace using Lithos
Protocol to standardize these things and

202
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:54,000
to give them a better chance of just a
more equitable, because I don't like to

203
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:00,000
use fairness because it's like who decides
what's fair, right?

204
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,000
But if you actually create a more
equitable situation, right? So where you

205
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,000
have the opportunity for people to
participate at their capacity, not at like

206
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,000
what some middleman says or government
says they can and how much, you know,

207
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:24,000
like, okay, so how much is the government
gonna rob us today? Cause they're the only

208
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,000
ones they can get the stuff out of the
country.

209
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:34,000
You know, once this kind of stuff is kind
of mitigated by the technology that we

210
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,000
have, and I think, you know, I mean,
that's kind of the ethos of what Ergo is

211
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:44,000
about. I know Alex is really passionate
about Africa, and I mean, I think that's

212
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,000
kind of like the, some of our core values
are about that, right? So you kind of give

213
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:54,000
them the tooling, create an equitable,
opportunity-inclusive environment and give

214
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,000
people the opportunity to kind of take
advantage of it.

215
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Did they take advantage of it? And, you
know, just kind of leave it up to their

216
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
initiative, right? It's the same with
Ergo, because, you know, we actually have

217
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,000
these conversations at the office. I
talked to Luca about this quite a bit, you

218
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
know. And that's just about Ergo. It's not
really specifically about Ergo. It's just

219
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,000
about just in general ethos of the
blockchain space.

220
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
You know, there is this sometimes, not
all the time, but sometimes in some

221
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
ecosystems, what you get is this like
sense of entitlement. Like we deserve to

222
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
be here. You know, we're, you know, like
why did these guys get to have all the

223
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
fun? We deserve this space. We, you know,
we're getting, we're oppressed, we're

224
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
suppressed.

225
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,000
And to a degree that might be true, you
know, with various different micro or

226
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:56,000
maybe some macro environmental, you know,
I guess, whatever you want to call them

227
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,000
causalities. But for the most part, you
know, it's about providing the, a

228
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:06,000
blockchain is supposed to provide the
tooling and the environment for innovation

229
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,000
to thrive. What happens after that is not
up to the blockchain.

230
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,000
It's not up to Alex to go out and tell
people to use Ergo. It's about people

231
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:24,000
using Ergo and then doing business on Ergo
and then getting that business out there,

232
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,000
right? And this is why I chose to start a
business on Ergo and this is why I chose

233
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:34,000
to, instead of going out there and
evangelizing or whatever the word is, Ergo

234
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,000
to the masses and saying use Ergo, I'm
using Ergo.

235
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,000
You know, I thought that that's the best
way to lead is to I create an enterprise,

236
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
a real enterprise, the kind that I keep
talking about, and I've been talking about

237
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,000
for years, on Ergo, and I do it myself.
You know, this company was built, was

238
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,000
started around Ergo technology.

239
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
And this is actually what I hope others
would do is take the initiative to start

240
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
their own business using this technology.
And so like to get back to what I was

241
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
saying, you know, we have to kind of stop
with this feeling of entitlement. You

242
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
know, nobody owes us anything. You know,
we owe it to ourselves. We owe it to

243
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
ourselves to use technology to build
stuff.

244
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,000
This is why I'm such a big supporter of
something like ErgoHack, you know, because

245
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
that's the community taking initiative and
building something and building something

246
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,000
and then then kind of deciding, you know,
if it has legs, if it doesn't have legs,

247
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,000
right? And a lot of really cool innovation
came out of that. I mean, they're building

248
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
things like, say, Rosen Bridge, for
example, you know, and that came out of, I

249
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,000
mean, and that's, you know, that's an
innovative new technology that is really

250
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,000
pretty much one of a kind.

251
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:58,000
So yeah, it's like we should all not have
that kind of feeling of bitterness and

252
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,000
saying, well, these guys are bigger than
us, they don't deserve to be there. It's

253
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:08,000
like, no, fuck that. It is what it is. If
you think that this blockchain is so good,

254
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:13,000
and it is, Ergo is that good, build on
Ergo. Go for it. Do it.

255
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:21,000
And even if, you know, maybe Ergo is not
gonna be number one on the price charts

256
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:27,000
right above Bitcoin, but you're gonna get
enough business through Ergo for Ergo to

257
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:33,000
stay relevant and stay strong and evolve
for a long, long time. I think that's the

258
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:39,000
best way that you can assure that this
ecosystem stays relevant and blossoms and

259
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:45,000
the rent.

260
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Good rent then.

261
00:25:52,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Right, so yeah, it's about giving the
same access, right, to free markets to

262
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:08,000
everyone, well, regardless of color,
right, and other factors.

263
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,000
It's transparency as well, right? Same
access transfer. So the thing that I think

264
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
humans in nature, especially when you get
up into the level of middleman as Dan is

265
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
talking about, there's ultimate like
temptation for corruption, right? Look at

266
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
the olive oil business, right? Look how
fucked up that is, right? You know, just

267
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
opportunities to keep on shortchanging
people.

268
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
And whatever, if you want to do that
stuff, great. But make it transparent to

269
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
the user. Whereas, you know, the
blockchain hopefully can do that,

270
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
especially with what Dan's doing. So if
you want to sell shitty olive oil, great.

271
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
But let the consumer know that they can
trace it back and see which part is actual

272
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
real olive oil and which part is, you
know, pine oil or whatever the heck

273
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
they're using as a substitute.

274
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,000
And then let the user choose if they want
to buy a cheaper version of that as

275
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,000
opposed to the real thing. Same with
cacao, same with pineapples, all that kind

276
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,000
of stuff, whatever. Corruption will be
visible at least in that aspect. And if it

277
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,000
works out and that's what people want,
then so be it.

278
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:13,000
And that's actually a really good point.
If we are going to be in this kind of

279
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:20,000
decentralized new way of community-driven,
non-communist type of community-driven

280
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:27,000
stuff, right? If we're actually gonna do
it like, you know... in a sustainable way.

281
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:34,000
You can't on one hand, you know, not want,
you know, or want minimal government

282
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:41,000
interference or minimum regulations or
minimal like control.

283
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
And on the other hand, wait for somebody
to come and wipe your ass because it's

284
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
like, those guys are doing bad stuff. You
should really, you know, you should really

285
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
like, like that's not, you know, somebody
should tell like, Mom that they're selling

286
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
fake olive oil is like, well, you tell
people that are selling fake olive oil

287
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
because you're going to use the technology
that is at your disposal to show that you

288
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
have real olive oil.

289
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,000
And this is what we're doing in Greece
because we're working with the producers

290
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,000
over there. We're helping them do that
because there is actually a huge problem

291
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,000
with Greek olive oil, just like there's a
problem with Italian olive oil as well.

292
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Just a lot of fakes out there, a lot of,
you know, it's kind of like the Egyptian,

293
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:27,000
some of it is like, kind of like the
Egyptian, what is it, the Egyptian linen

294
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
or the Egyptian silk, whatever it was,
that effect.

295
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:41,000
The Egyptian cotton, yeah, yeah, it's
like, if somebody Egyptian touches it, it

296
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:46,000
already becomes Egyptian cotton. Doesn't
matter. It's like kosher, kosherizing

297
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:51,000
things. Like the rabbi winked at it, it's
now kosher. Anyway, but I mean, actually,

298
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:56,000
actually, that's actually something else
that I've been really considering getting

299
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:01,000
into is kosher certified kosher
certification, because I mean, that that's

300
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:06,000
like, that that's like a given thing. And
you know what, actually, you know, us Jews

301
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,000
are actually pretty industrious and that
kind of stuff, where like, we don't fight

302
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:16,000
against technology.

303
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,000
So I think actually, and I haven't really
kind of, you know, put my feelers out, but

304
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,000
I think that potentially could also be a
really interesting field to get into and

305
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,000
to kind of like kosher certification halal
certification you know you could track

306
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,000
your favorite rabbi and only buy goods
that he certified like baseball cards for

307
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,000
rabbis yeah that'd be awesome you know
it's you can like track them like an uber

308
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,000
You know, there's a rabbi within five
minutes away from you. They can certify

309
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,000
your stuff kosher. Anyway, yeah, there's a
lot of opportunity out there. But like I

310
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
said, we just can't expect on one hand to
be free and on the other hand to expect

311
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,000
somebody to come and wipe our asses. I
mean, yeah, like you said, going back to

312
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,000
what you said, they can sell shitty olive
oil all they want, but it's up to you to

313
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,000
say, well, you know what? They're selling
shitty olive oil. I'm selling the good

314
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,000
stuff. I can prove it. They can't.

315
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
And then the consumer decides maybe they
still want to buy shitty olive oil. You're

316
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
not going to force them. You're not going
to guilt them into it. But sooner or

317
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
later, if it is a competitive product,
then they, you know, they will switch to

318
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
it. They will start using it the same,
like say the same thing with like electric

319
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
cars, right?

320
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Just think about, look at the electric
cars, look at the Tesla, right? Electric

321
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,000
cars have been around since like the
beginning of the 20th century, literally

322
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,000
from like the teens. I think the first
electric car was something like in the,

323
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,000
like literally right after the first Ford
started to come out, there was actually an

324
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,000
electric car already that was already
advertised.

325
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:03,000
And some said, oh, well, the technology
was suppressed by the petroleum industry

326
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:08,000
and the internal combustion engine
manufacturers and blah, blah, blah, blah.

327
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:13,000
But bottom line is that technology was
just not mainstream consumer viable. These

328
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:18,000
things had really short range. There was
not enough infrastructure set up for them.

329
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:23,000
They were too expensive. They were too
toxic. They were too impractical.

330
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:30,000
And for years, they were like that. They
were electric cars in the 70s, in the 80s,

331
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:36,000
in the 90s. And why did Teslas actually
become, and even before that, you know,

332
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:42,000
they were like the Honda Insight or
whatever I think it was called before the

333
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Teslas came out, you know, that was kind
of a thing thing, but not really a thing.

334
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:54,000
But why did the Teslas really blow up?
Because it's a mainstream viable product

335
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:00,000
that makes sense to people versus an
existing competitor like internal

336
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:06,000
combustion.

337
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
A Tesla makes sense because I can
actually use a Tesla the same way I can

338
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,000
use a car, you know, whatever around town.
Because there is a network, I can fuel the

339
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
thing up with, you know, I can charge the
thing up. It's got range, it's got power.

340
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
It's affordable. There is a support
network that makes sense.

341
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:27,000
And, you know, it's kind of like the same
thing with this, you know, it's when you

342
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:32,000
bring a mainstream viable product to the
market, even if that product is nouveau,

343
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:37,000
it can still penetrate the market really
well and become an actual real competitor

344
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:42,000
to the you know, to what's already out
there, if that is, like the support system

345
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:47,000
is there for people to say, okay, you know
what, like I said, going back to olive

346
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:52,000
oil, yes, there are all of these different
things, but if I get the good olive oil,

347
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:57,000
number one, it doesn't really cost that
much more. It doesn't really cost much at

348
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:02,000
all. There's like, you know, the price
difference is laughable, number one.

349
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Number two, it's better for me. Number
three, I'm actually getting real olive

350
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:18,000
oil, not getting like bullshit with olive
oil flavor. So that's just like, it's free

351
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:23,000
market competitive viable products that
are utilizing the technology that will win

352
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:28,000
this fight.

353
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Yeah. Yeah, I agree with Ergo as a
backbone for sure. All right, so we've

354
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:43,000
got, let me jump in to say that we've got
some preliminary things for the Ergo

355
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Meetup 2025 in Colorado. Dan, are you
going to be able to make it?

356
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:55,000
I yes, potentially I can actually October
September something like that September.

357
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:01,000
It's like October 11th or something like
that October 11th now. I just want to

358
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:07,000
confirm. I just want to confirm so there
was the What was that movie with with with

359
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:13,000
ice with iced tea? Surviving the Game

360
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Is that like a Disney movie?

361
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,000
No, it's not a Disney movie. It's about
like he's this this like homeless guy that

362
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,000
gets a job and he thinks he's a guide in
like, like a camping place. But he

363
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,000
actually is like hunted by a bunch of rich
people. He actually is like, yeah, because

364
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,000
because he's like, you know,

365
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
But Joe's got a bunch of rifles, so we
might be able to do that if that's what

366
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
you want.

367
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,000
That's what I'm saying. I just want to
make sure that it's actually not a way for

368
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Joe to trap us on his mountain and to,
what was it, the deadliest game? The Most

369
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Dangerous Game or deadliest game?

370
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Yeah, something like that.

371
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:01,000
The Most Dangerous Game, yeah. I just
hope it's not that. Or I hope it's not

372
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:08,000
like... what... Hunger Games. It's not
Hunger Games either.

373
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
It could be.

374
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Alright, awesome, awesome. So we have
preliminary, we have, I'll just bank

375
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:20,000
through it really quickly, but we have
Friday. When people arrive, we'll set a

376
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:25,000
time where we can kind of group up at
either a local bar or a local pub just to

377
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:30,000
say hi and meet and greet the people that
have showed up on Friday. Saturday morning

378
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:35,000
breakfast. That'd be on your own. We're
just going to start the thing at 10 a.m.

379
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:40,000
for kind of a meet and greet, and then the
first speakers will come on. First

380
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:45,000
speakers are LGD, LDG, and MiGoreng.
They're going to talk about the uniqueness

381
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:50,000
of palm staking and perhaps gluon theorems
as well, so that'll be a cool talk.

382
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,000
11 a.m., a little after 11, we're going
to try to get a food truck on site. and

383
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,000
that's when the beer can start flowing as
well. Joe is working or he obtained the

384
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,000
liquor license for the event, for the
venue. There's going to be a speaker at

385
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,000
lunch and that's going to be qx(), if you
guys are familiar with qx(). He's going to

386
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,000
talk about Lithos. He's going to do a
protocol deep dive on Lithos.

387
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:21,000
At 12:30 p.m., we're going to do
something unique. We're going to try

388
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:26,000
potentially a hackathon kickoff, a short
one that's an hour and a half. It's going

389
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:31,000
to be called AI Hobby Devs vs. Old Timer
Devs. And the rules are that it's going to

390
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:36,000
be a sealed envelope with a dApp that
nobody knows about that's going to be

391
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:41,000
doable by hand coding devs in an hour and
a half.

392
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,000
And it's going to be unsealed there and
read to the two teams. And the

393
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,000
stipulations are that AI devs, when they
create the app, they need to try to mimic

394
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:53,000
what a front-end would look like if a dev
was hand-coding it, and I'll get to that

395
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,000
later. Non-AI devs are allowed to pillage
Stack Overflow or their own code from a

396
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,000
project to make it faster, of course.

397
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Judging will be done by three selected
members of the community who will do so

398
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,000
blindly, meaning they cannot watch the
hackathon. They have to go get a beer

399
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,000
somewhere or get a cigarette for the hour
and a half or whatever. Just don't look at

400
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,000
the screens when the hackathon's going on.
I know, right?

401
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,000
So the team goals are build the best app
with the least amount of UX bugs and try

402
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,000
to fool the judges into thinking your
build is actually the opposite team's

403
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,000
build. So judging is based on best app
with the least UI bugs. That's one point

404
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,000
per judge per team. And number two, the
judge has to name the team who designed

405
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,000
the dApp. And if the team fools the judge,
then they get that point.

406
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,000
So the winning team will get a donation
from the Sigmanauts, an award from the

407
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Sigmanauts. We have to vote on how much
that is. So I think that'd be kind of a

408
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,000
neat comparison hackathon. Let the core
devs and the hand coding devs do their

409
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,000
thing. Let the AI kind of hobbyist devs
crank some stuff out. See if they can fool

410
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,000
the judges to see who wrote what. And also
create a neat little dApp that will

411
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,000
actually function well.

412
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
So that'll be a fun little thing to watch
while we're all drinking a lot of beer.

413
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
2:15 will be an afternoon speaker. That'll
be Aaron on VR. He's going to talk about

414
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Machina Finance, which would be very nice
to hear in person and ask questions about

415
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
because we don't know a ton of that. We
just know what Joe's posted on Twitter and

416
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
all that kind of stuff.

417
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:35,000
4 p.m. will be a group hike. We're going
to go to the Paul Intamin Nature Trail,

418
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:41,000
suggested by Mark the Shark. I hope that
dinners at 7 We can do IHOP on Saturday

419
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:47,000
morning, Dan. Saturday morning will be
IHOP. I'll put that in there.

420
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
I like where it's going.

421
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:55,000
7 PM will be dinner. We're still taking
suggestions for where that is. And

422
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Sunday's breakfast at Urban Egg. We have
to do a group reservation there, so we

423
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:05,000
need to know counts. But I was going to
say, kushti, are you able during this time

424
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:10,000
to zoom in and give an afternoon welcome
or something like that?

425
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Oh, let's see. So I'll try to get a visa
in the first place in July and then, yeah,

426
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:23,000
let's see. I mean, the chance is probably
minimal, but let's see.

427
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,000
That's amazing. If you can't get a visa,
then that'd be great if you could zoom in

428
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
and we'll have you up on the screen. We'll
also live stream. We'll live stream all

429
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,000
the talks to the community. We'll also
live stream the hackathon. I'm going to

430
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,000
bring my gear so we can extract the
people's monitors, essentially. And we'll

431
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,000
live stream all their code monitors on the
screen so you can see the two different

432
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,000
teams.

433
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,000
So it'll be quite the watchable event
from off the in-person event part of it

434
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,000
too. But super excited to see people that
are coming and see everybody there and to

435
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,000
execute this thing. So that'll be fun.
Great. I'm glad you two are going to try

436
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,000
to come. That's fantastic.

437
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:10,000
It's in October, I think, because I'm
going to be in the US in August for Rare.

438
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Actually, I might have to be there in
September because there's a tea thing.

439
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Anyway, yeah, I'll do my best to make it.
I think I can work it out. Yeah, just like

440
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:34,000
I said, make sure that Joe is not going to
hunt us. Just make sure, okay, QX, you

441
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:42,000
left now, but then, you know what?

442
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,000
If he invites you back up to his mountain
resort, he probably should be worried.

443
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Okay, so I'm not going to brag, but I do
cardio. And I tested it. I don't really

444
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:59,000
exert myself in just running through the
station or whatever. But I have put it to

445
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:05,000
the test before, and I'm just like, holy
shit, I'm not dead. So I don't know if

446
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:11,000
you're there yet or not. I don't know how
far you can sprint away from the men

447
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:17,000
hunting you, QX.

448
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,000
You just have to be faster than the
slowest guy, Dan. That's it. That's the

449
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,000
only requirement. So I think we'll be
fine. So that's what I'm saying. Are you

450
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,000
the slowest guy? I'm pretty fast. We'll
see. We'll have to do a foot race. Let's

451
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,000
drink a lot of beers and do a foot race.

452
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,000
You're pretty fast at IHOP. That's about
it.

453
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,000
All right. We got a question from
Kufurums. He wants to put some Ergo miners

454
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,000
in Argentina. Is there any source where I
can read like a step by step? That's

455
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,000
awesome. I would say Kufa, you should join
the Sigmanauts mining group. And even if

456
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,000
you don't mine to that pool, there's a ton
of channels in there where you can talk

457
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
about mining, you can talk about card
tuning, you can talk about what rigs to

458
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,000
do.

459
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Mark the shark's in chat here. He runs
the mining pool. So yeah, jump in the

460
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Sigmanauts mining pool. I think you'll get
a lot of community response there and help

461
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,000
you out. It's very non-competitive, very
accepting, very, very welcoming. What

462
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,000
else? We got any other questions, Dan?

463
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:22,000
All right. And that time, so just now,
Ergo Foundation, it seems, announced a

464
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:29,000
raffle for Banxa integration. QX, maybe,
you know, more details about that?

465
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
I don't.

466
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:36,000
All right. So guys, please check the news
channel. Let's see.

467
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:42,000
That is Banxa, OnRamper and Banxa
integration. Oh, interesting. This may

468
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:48,000
have been what's been in the works for a
while. Yeah. I didn't think this had US.

469
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:54,000
This is fantastic. Oh, yeah. I don't think
it has New York. This is fantastic. Yeah,

470
00:42:54,000 --> 00:43:00,000
it doesn't have New York or Hawaii or LA.
So there were a few. Yeah, I remember

471
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Glasgow talking about this. There's just a
few US restrictions, but that's OK.

472
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,000
I have my Peruvian passport to buy this
stuff anyway.

473
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:21,000
But they're everywhere, right? This New
York. But can you actually go from New

474
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:28,000
York to some upstate town by there? That
doesn't work.

475
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:32,000
You could know you need to put in your
driver license on this site,

476
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,000
unfortunately. So it gets you. Yeah,
unfortunately. But it's OK. You know, I

477
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,000
still have my path, at least. I can either
buy it with my wife's Peruvian passport.

478
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:44,000
She buys it or else I buy it through
Coinbase. I do the ADA. Well, actually,

479
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,000
smarter, I buy stable coin and then
convert it over to after it gets out of

480
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Coinbase. I'm not going to say why I do
that, but I think people can understand

481
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,000
why someone would do that.

482
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Why do you do that?

483
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:07,000
I think you know, Dan. That's awesome.
That's fantastic. Great. Yeah. So

484
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:12,000
everybody go to ergoraffle.com. I'll
actually post a link right in chat right

485
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:17,000
here. There we go. If it'll let me post a
chat. There we go. I just posted it in

486
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:22,000
chat. Go ahead. Let's, let's community
race for this puppy. 20K is a drop in the

487
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:27,000
bucket to give direct on-ramp access.

488
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:31,000
And what would be awesome too. So Joe and
I were both looking separately as well for

489
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:35,000
kind of like MoonPay US on-ramp options.
And the option that I found, of course, a

490
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:39,000
while ago did not have US yet. They were
planning to do it but you know that was a

491
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:43,000
year ago and they still haven't executed
that plan so and Joe found one as well

492
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:47,000
that was fairly around this price as well
but I can't remember what the deal with

493
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:51,000
those is but this would be awesome could
you guys imagine something like this

494
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:55,000
directly integrated into Rosen Bridge you
go to Rosen Bridge you click what you want

495
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:59,000
on whatever chain you want you type in you
hook up your credit card you make the

496
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:03,000
payment boom you exit from Rosen to
whatever chain that is connected to that

497
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:07,000
you want. No more like Coinbase to
SimplePay or whatever the hell that stuff

498
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:11,000
is, you know, off, you're just boom boom.
Fantastic.

499
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Now, guys, don't get your hopes up too
much. The fee on this is probably gonna be

500
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:26,000
a little bit more expensive than like
going through a centralized exchange, but

501
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:31,000
that's very attractive to a lot of people,
especially in a market as it is now when

502
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:36,000
the token prices are supposedly going to
be much higher in years from now. So yeah,

503
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:41,000
awesome. This is fantastic. Great job, EF.
This is great.

504
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,000
All right. Good job. Good job.

505
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,000
We got any other questions, Dan, kushti,
that you want to answer?

506
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Yeah, yeah. Do we have, so, yeah, we have
10 more minutes, so let's take two or

507
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:59,000
three questions, because... All right,
let's see.

508
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000
This one's for you, kushti. How do you
think ChainCash and Dexy will play in the

509
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,000
market? Any chance at attracting users
that weren't here before, essentially, new

510
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,000
users? Getting new people because of it?

511
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Yeah, so, well, for ChainCash there is
need, right, to find end users because,

512
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:27,000
well, it's kind of like assembly language
layer for monetary systems, I believe. So,

513
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:35,000
yeah, you can use it on very different
levels from small communities to, well,

514
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:43,000
international trade between corporations
and so on.

515
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:49,000
You think there'd be like an opportunity
with ZenGate or Palm Economy? You know,

516
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:53,000
they're already in those kind of places
with suppliers?

517
00:46:54,000 --> 00:47:01,000
That's what we're actually discussing and
that's what I'm also talking about with

518
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:08,000
some parties, but I cannot announce
anything. Yeah, well, you know, we have a

519
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:15,000
variety of assets, good assets now, well,
available. For example, if we take Africa

520
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:22,000
for international trades, like tokenized
real world assets, right, and well,

521
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:29,000
cryptocurrency for forecasts. And then,
yeah, they can be combined using

522
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:36,000
ChainCash.

523
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:43,000
There are some other schemes on Ergo,
which are of interest. In particular,

524
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:50,000
well, insurance with stable coins, that's
where I think Dexy Gold, and then Dexy

525
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Silver, Dexy Lithium, and so on. Stable
coins would be useful, right, so not just

526
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:04,000
to be used in DeFi, right, just as a
hedge, for example, if you hold some

527
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:11,000
portfolio, so you may have some, well,
ERGs there, right, and also some gold,

528
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:18,000
right, to hedge.

529
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Stable coin based gold algorithmic stable
coin based but I think another good option

530
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:38,000
is to have a buffer rights and trading
physical assets by using stable coin

531
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:47,000
digital twins so for example using Dexy
Gold to do insurance for physical gold

532
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:56,000
non-delivery, right, non-delivery risks.

533
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:04,000
And yeah, to also sell, for example,
non-produced tokenized lithium, right, so

534
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:11,000
you may use, well, Dexy Lithium buffer for
insurance. That would be quite

535
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:18,000
capital-efficient, right, even considering
capital-inefficient designs such as, well,

536
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Djed, Gluon, right, for security, but
basically in most of algorithmic

537
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:32,000
stablecoins, right, for security of
pegging, you are paying with capital

538
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:39,000
inefficiency, but then there are some hot
talks, I mean, how to use them in real

539
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:46,000
world applications.

540
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:59,000
And I think this is not an issue, right?
If you are using algorithmic stablecoins

541
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:08,000
as a buffer, right? So you just need for
some are not so big amounts, right, to

542
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:17,000
provide insurance for non-delivery, right,
and like that, right, you can also use

543
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:26,000
them for settlements on the right. So,
yeah, well, there are lots of different

544
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:35,000
possible applications here.

545
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:45,000
So, I'm discussing and there are also
some simplified designs such as basis,

546
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:52,000
which is mostly off-chain simplified
variant of ChainCash proposed recently

547
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:59,000
over the forum. And currently, some pals
of mine are working on Gitcircles, which

548
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:06,000
is kind of framework to create community
currencies for developers of open source

549
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:13,000
projects, right, using similar ideas, but
actually they think to start even with

550
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:20,000
simpler options, so with just on-chain
tokens and on-chain DeFi, such as using LP

551
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:27,000
pool, just right to sponsor an open source
project, for example, but yeah, I think,

552
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:34,000
well, off-chain option would be quite
appealing in the future, right? And yeah,

553
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:41,000
so for ChainCash itself, so yeah, well, we
are doing different talks under the hood,

554
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:48,000
and then probably it would be better to
consider some concrete applications,

555
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:55,000
right, and make initial UIs towards that.

556
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Awesome. All right, we've got a couple
more.

557
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:10,000
But maybe Dan also can have some opinion
on the Dexy Gold and the other algorithmic

558
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:18,000
stable coin assets in the presence of
physical twins.

559
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Yeah, so this is actually something that
I spoke about before. This is kind of like

560
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:30,000
the continuation of what I spoke about
when I mentioned this months ago on

561
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:36,000
socials that we would be working on a
hybrid lithium, pegged lithium backed

562
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:42,000
stablecoin. And so this is actually what
kushti's talking about right now. So we

563
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:48,000
actually, you know, I spoke with kushti
about this several times, spoke with Sam

564
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:54,000
about it several times. It took a little
bit of time to flesh it out. And really, I

565
00:52:54,000 --> 00:53:00,000
mean, that's what, you know, that's
essentially what we're talking about here.

566
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Yeah, and so I think that this is
actually, this would be very big player in

567
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:20,000
regions where you have restricted
movement. In the case of lithium, for

568
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:28,000
example, if you have, for example, market
manipulation, and so you have restricted

569
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:36,000
logistics, for example, you have a smaller
lithium mining facility and you are being

570
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:44,000
thrown, you know, monkey wrenches in your
plans because the logistics corridors are

571
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:52,000
controlled by somebody, right? That
happens.

572
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:56,000
One of the biggest issues with lithium
mining is actually logistics. And in fact,

573
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:00,000
the big companies, you know, the Chinese
companies and whatnot, they actually bring

574
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:04,000
in their own logistics. They literally
just bring the whole thing in. They don't

575
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:08,000
even bother trying to put it together
locally. They bring it all in just with

576
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:12,000
them.

577
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:17,000
So if you're a smaller organization,
that's actually a big major thing for you

578
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:21,000
to consider is logistics or lack of
logistics. And so again, what that creates

579
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:25,000
is a delay in delivery. So it's not a
complete inability to deliver, but it's a

580
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:29,000
delay in delivery. Another one is
potential price manipulation by some

581
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:33,000
adversarial actors.

582
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:42,000
So you have some of these bigger
producers or lithium producers, they will

583
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:48,000
manipulate the price because they control
a good chunk of a certain region's lithium

584
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:54,000
production. And if the lithium price is
too low, they'll stop producing the

585
00:54:54,000 --> 00:55:00,000
lithium. Right, and since they actually
have the logistics network and the smaller

586
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:06,000
places don't, the smaller places won't be
able to take their lithium to the buyer.

587
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:14,000
And so they're going to have to wait. And
so even if they have a buyer for the

588
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:18,000
lithium, they won't be able to make
delivery. So what do you do in that case?

589
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Well, in that case, you still want to keep
your operation going, right? You can't

590
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:26,000
afford, if you're a smaller operation, to
shut down like the big ones do. And if

591
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:30,000
you're a multi-billion dollar operation,
yeah, you can shut down and whatever, you

592
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:34,000
know, you, you, you'll be okay. It's all
kind of balanced out, but a smaller guys

593
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:38,000
is going to kill them.

594
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:48,000
So what do you do? Well, if you have
this, lithium peg, lithium backed stable

595
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:55,000
coin they're using, and you have this kind
of this, you know, insurance feature built

596
00:55:55,000 --> 00:56:02,000
into it where you can actually still get,
still get payment and utilize the

597
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:09,000
stablecoin based on promised reserves.

598
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:14,000
But for the coin to keep stability, it
has to then accommodate with pegged assets

599
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:19,000
and with algorithmic assets, then that way
you can basically have a chance to sustain

600
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:24,000
your business until you can actually
fulfill that. And so it becomes

601
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:29,000
algorithmic at that point. You can still
pay for new things. You can still utilize

602
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:34,000
the asset. And then when you make
delivery, then it goes back into the

603
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:39,000
reserves.

604
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:48,000
So that particular part of the lithium
can go back into the reserve. We can

605
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:54,000
basically fulfill a lithium delivery so
that it becomes backed again instead of

606
00:56:54,000 --> 00:57:00,000
pegged. I think there's quite a lot of
real-world practical applications for

607
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:06,000
this. Of course, it needs to be fleshed
out, logistics of it and everything needs

608
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:12,000
to be fleshed out. I think this is a big
deal and it could potentially really

609
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:18,000
create that opportunity inclusion that I
keep talking about. I'm just really

610
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:24,000
excited to be able to work on this with
kushti.

611
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:32,000
Wow, he just spilled the beans. Alright,
it's 10 of 2. Let's see, we got anything

612
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:39,000
quick that we can do? It's like 3am for
Dan there. He's got to be tired.

613
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Yeah, I got I got a I got a Palm Discord
AMA right now that I'm Oh for so All

614
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:48,000
right.

615
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:53,000
Sounds good. We'll wrap it up. Just
reminded everybody to please I spoke with

616
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:57,000
Joe this week after the AMA last week. We
are going to put his medium votes for

617
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Rosen up on Paideia for votes. So if
you're a Sigmanauts we have to vote on our

618
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:05,000
decision there.

619
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:09,000
And just in short, that's part of those
proposals is to provide liquidity to the

620
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:13,000
DEXs, as well as do some air drops to
Cardano side with Rosen ERG so that we can

621
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:17,000
buff up our wallets for potential
centralized exchange listings. So if

622
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:21,000
you're not a Sigmanauts and you don't have
power to vote, you can still rally the

623
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:25,000
Sigmanauts. You can still rally all the
GARD's that are also voting.

624
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:29,000
You know, think of them not as your
representative necessarily, but if you can

625
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:32,000
give them a compelling reason to vote for
why you think they should vote for that,

626
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:35,000
then don't be afraid to talk to them. Get
out there and campaign, essentially. But

627
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:38,000
yes, great.

628
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:44,000
And I'll post something on the web with a
tentative schedule, as well as the GitHub

629
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:50,000
sign up and the little document sign up
for the Ergo Meetup. So please sign up and

630
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:56,000
join if you're going to make it. Great.
Close it out, kushti, please.

631
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Yeah, so have a good day, Ergonauts, and
yeah, well, have a busy time, and yeah,

632
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:12,000
well, let's get the wider adoption
together.

633
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:16,000
I'm all for that. Let's do it. Great.

634
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,000
Great to see everybody.

635
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Yeah. Thanks a lot, everybody. Yeah. So I
guess what? Next week, same time, same

636
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:23,000
place, same channel. You got it. Sounds
about right, yeah. Probably the same

637
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:26,000
people.

638
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:31,000
Maybe, probably, would be good to see Joe
again.

639
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:35,000
Yeah, let's see Joe. Let's get Joe here
as well. We got MiGoreng can warm up as

640
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:39,000
well for his speech at the meetup. Yeah.
Get them all tuned up.

641
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Why are you going to let this guy on?

642
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Yeah, he sees all right.

643
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:47,000
He's all right sometimes. All right guys.

644
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Ciao.

645
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:51,000
All right guys. Thanks a lot. Good day.
Bye. Yeah. Barely alive from Japan signing

646
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:54,000
off.
