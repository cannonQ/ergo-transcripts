1
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Hey.

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Hello everyone.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
My pleasure to be here again.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
And today, well, there are three of us.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So we have mgPai again.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Hey, everyone.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Nice to be on again.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It's great to be here with you, mgPai.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I've missed you a lot.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Oh, is that the case?

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
All right.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Where's your TMG pie?

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Oh, I mean, I just we all have nothing in
my hands.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
You just woke up at nine o'clock, sir.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Are you OK?

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm not OK. Nice.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
All right.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
So what's new, kushti?

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
You've been busy, real busy.

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:14,000
You know you will be safe let's say. All
right so yeah a lot of things going on so

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:23,000
well fixing some issues with 6.0 as yeah
Dusek is doing well quite awesome audit so

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:32,000
finally some good quality audit is coming.

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
So, yeah, well, fixing issues being
found.

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Then, yeah, so for sub-blocks, yeah,
working on, well, prototype implementation

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,000
of, well, blocks generation, so, well,
spreading transactions.

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Input blocks and so on.

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:02,000
So maybe next week even I will have some
demo for local DevNets, well local miner

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:10,000
based I mean because yes stratum is not
ready stratum proxy and so on.

29
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:17,000
So well that's just initial prototype
local miner based.

30
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Then what else?

31
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
So, yeah, well, and gentlemen, as you are
probably both mining in the testnet and

32
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
only you, right, then, yeah, let's
consider a 6.0 activation date in the

33
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
testnet.

34
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:43,000
So, yeah, maybe by tomorrow so that there
is one issue how to be fixed and then yeah

35
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:51,000
we can do another release candidate 6.0
release candidate with public testnet

36
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:59,000
activation details and well yeah testnet
has some custom soft fork activation

37
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:07,000
parameters so that means we can have
activation quite soon then and then yeah

38
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:15,000
well audit to be continued so I've started
a raffle actually well to raise some funds

39
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:23,000
for rewarding Dusek and then yeah well
with audits done, and I also will recheck

40
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:31,000
everything a few more times, and then we
can think about watching mainnet

41
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:39,000
activation, maybe starting from March,
something like that.

42
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
So, yeah, a lot of things going on.

43
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Also, well, Dexy Gold audit is done, so
all the 18 contracts reviewed.

44
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:09,000
And, yeah, so currently, well, the issue
is too, well, Polish backend.

45
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
And then, yeah, well, consider how
front-end would like and who will work on

46
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
that.

47
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:28,000
So, well, maybe and hopefully and already
pre-confirmed that C8 will do UI.

48
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Yeah, well, other options are not so
viable at the moment.

49
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I'm also pushing guys to start a new
SigmaUSD Oracle Pool version 2 based.

50
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:05,000
For Oracle Pool updates, I finished the
code to produce needed transactions.

51
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'm going to test in the testnet and then
we can consider how to update the mainnet

52
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
pool.

53
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
So yeah, a lot of things going on in
parallel.

54
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Also, there are some talks going on
within I think to propose actually some

55
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:38,000
things in regards with reworking things
based on experience I've got from ErgoDevs

56
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:47,000
as well as other organizations we have in
the community such as Sigmanauts, Ergo

57
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Foundation and so on.

58
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:06,000
And yeah, well, posted recently, well,
Core Track roadmap based on my own

59
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:15,000
observations and also feedback got from
other developers.

60
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
And yeah, thinking to do that for other
tracks, well, we need to consider what to

61
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
do with pools, so trying to get from
Palmyra what they're planning to do with

62
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Lithos Protocol and so on.

63
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Then yeah there is need to get well
information from Oracle Pools so I'm

64
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:43,000
pushing guys to do there so yeah well a
lot of mess there yeah big because it's

65
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:50,000
not so you know centralized shitcoin with
team I mean all that's bizarre.

66
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Yeah, we have different scams basically.

67
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
But yeah, you know if you want to
coordinate and well, even get a picture

68
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
from what's going on, that's complicated.

69
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
And that should be complicated, I guess.

70
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:22,000
That's the point of having a normal
community, not stimulated one like

71
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:31,000
shitcoins are doing with, well, sponsoring
mercenaries and so on.

72
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:37,000
All right. What's on your end, guys?

73
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I think mgPai should go next.

74
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Yeah, sure.

75
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
So let's see.

76
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
So over the last, I think, few months or
so since I've been on here, I haven't had

77
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
too many updates.

78
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:59,000
But one thing I've been discussing with a
few members in the development community

79
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:06,000
is the standardization of off-chain bots
and framework.

80
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I think that's quite important, because
for those of you who don't know, off-chain

81
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:18,000
bots are needed to process transactions
that go through more complex smart

82
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:24,000
contracts, such as your DEX transactions,
NFT marketplace transactions, or certain

83
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,000
ones, and then DuckPools.

84
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
They all use these off-chain bot
executors, and the problem with them and

85
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
they're more specific.

86
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
They're all specific to UTXO blockchains.

87
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
And the problem with them development
wise is that it takes a lot of time,

88
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
effort, research and work to actually have
one running.

89
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
That's why development on these chains
just takes so long compared to something

90
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
like EVM, where you don't need any of it.

91
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Of course, the downsides of not having an
EVM, right?

92
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
It might make development experience
better, but it makes the blockchain much

93
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,000
heavier and have a lot of bloat and all,
and you can't run a node as easily.

94
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
So the problem on Ergo, and frankly on
Cardano as well, is that there's no

95
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
standardization of this.

96
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
As a developer, you just got to do
everything from scratch, build everything.

97
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
And everyone has their own way.

98
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I looked at DuckPools' code.

99
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
It's in Python.

100
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
And they're using some node API to write
everything.

101
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Then Spectrum is on the other end, where
it's a very complex and heavy code base.

102
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Then my own framework is also different
compared to how both of them do it.

103
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I would like to think it's in the middle
between the complexity of DuckPools and

104
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Spectrum.

105
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
And then everyone just has their own way.

106
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
And we kind of got to fix this.

107
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
And recently, Fleet SDK, the JavaScript
framework for building Ergo, has been

108
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
getting really good.

109
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:17,000
It's supporting a lot of things that were
needed from the Java and the Ergo AppKit.

110
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
So recently I've been playing around with
that and experimenting with writing my own

111
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
off-chain in a different language, in
TypeScript, and it's going pretty well.

112
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
There's not many bottlenecks left.

113
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
So I think that's the next step for
developers or the DevDAO is to create a

114
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,000
standardized framework for off-chain,
maybe record a few videos and have some

115
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
good documentation on how to go about it.

116
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Like maybe kushti was mentioning that
Dexy Gold is coming up, the audit is going

117
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,000
well, the UI is in progress by C8.

118
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
So maybe it'd be a good framework or a
good opportunity to demonstrate how

119
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
off-chain works by maybe writing it in
Fleet SDK using or to execute Dexy Gold

120
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
transactions.

121
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,000
And another thing is that I've been doing
over the past almost year is learning a

122
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,000
new language called Go.

123
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
And the benefits of this language is that
it's very good for concurrent

124
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
applications.

125
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
So it just processes things more
efficiently, or it's easier for developers

126
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
to process things more efficiently.

127
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,000
So, you know, we have another community
member, the guy who's doing the Keystone

128
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,000
integration, PG, and he's working on a Go
library for Ergo, right?

129
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
So the development and it's like almost
like it's almost good, you know, just a

130
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
few more issues.

131
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
But the development of this would be also
nice because Go is a really good language

132
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
to do this in, to do off-chain.

133
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
And so we're really looking forward to
that.

134
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
So, you know, as time goes on, the
development experience is looking really

135
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
good for Ergo.

136
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:10,000
We're getting more and more tools at hand
to attract a diverse set of skills.

137
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,000
So I think that's also the next frontier,
along with kushti doing his own updates on

138
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:22,000
the node.

139
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
That's just fantastic, mgPai.

140
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I love your hat.

141
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Where'd you get your hat from?

142
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Yeah, this is actually some new merch I
got from Crypto Chips.

143
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I was talking to the founder of Crypto
Chips.

144
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I'm like, hey, we need some Ergo hats and
all going.

145
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
So he sent me a good nice prototype of
what he can achieve so the community might

146
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
see this drop in the future.

147
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:54,000
You're extorting free swag from
suppliers.

148
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I'm prototyping here.

149
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
That's awesome.

150
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Well, speaking of swag, I put up an
announcement last week.
