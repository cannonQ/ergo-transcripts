00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Happy New Year, Ergo.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Welcome to 2025.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
How you doing, kushti?

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Happy New Year, guys.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:25,000
So yeah, I'm now trying to update a
pinned post in the Telegram group.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
What's a pinned post in the Telegram
group?

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Oh, so this is my announcement, actually.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Oh, nice.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Perfect.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
A bit late, but anyway, so yeah, it's
just January 2nd, right?

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:47,000
So everything is still quite chilling.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Yeah, catching up on sleep, starting a
new year. Have you done anything

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
fascinating already this year, kushti?

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Not quite, so I'm actually working on
sub-blocks CEP, so planning to present it,

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I don't know, like tonight or tomorrow,
something like that, but yeah, just slowly

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
working on that.

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:22,000
We've been interrupted constantly, so
yeah, let's see.

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Not sure it will be done today, but yeah,
I'm working.

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Well, that's exciting. You think
sub-blocks will see them, we'll see them,

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
at least some proof of concept testing
soon.

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Yeah. So what I'm working now is how to
pack transactions into input blocks

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:55,000
sub-blocks right and yeah then how to
update state and yeah, what could be rules

23
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:04,000
for different transactions because some
transactions are depending on, well, block

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:13,000
header contents, right, so predicted block
header, so basically next block and, yeah,

25
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:22,000
so validity of transaction can be changed
from one input block to another.

26
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
So, well, the current proposal is to
allow them in order or ordering blocks

27
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,000
only so well full blocks right in
terminology so like every two minutes on

28
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
them but they are like 99% of transactions
it's possible to well, confirm them

29
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
immediately.

30
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
And then, yeah, the question is how to
update state, how to form candidates and

31
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
so on. So you're working on that.

32
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,000
And yeah, so once this is fully clear and
there is some prototype code, then yeah, I

33
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,000
think other parts are quite
straightforward.

34
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,000
But yeah, still a lot of work, but yeah.

35
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I think in a few days it would be quite
clear how to get and what could be time

36
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:29,000
estimation about getting through the
hardest part.

37
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
So these transactions forming and state
updating and then, yeah, it's more or less

38
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
straightforward.

39
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
A lot of work, but yeah, quite
straightforward.

40
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
All right. So is my sound good?

41
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
It sounds great, kushti.

42
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It's doing great.

43
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Well, on our side, the Sigmanauts mining
DAO is launching a meme token that we

44
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:06,000
found during storage rent collection.

45
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
So for those of you that don't know, if
there's a box that's reached its age of

46
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
four years and it doesn't have enough ERG
to cover storage rent, the whole box is

47
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
destroyed and claimable by miners.

48
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
And if that box contains any tokens,
those tokens also go to the miners.

49
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
So there's a token that CannonQ launched
with the new launch platform and it's a

50
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
PHP token.

51
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
It's meant to be a meme token that is
gonna be educating.

52
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
So I think there's still some room left
if you guys want to help out with that

53
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
launch.

54
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:53,000
But it's kind of a cool concept as we
come along.

55
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I think we got lucky with that. I think
we got the whole supply of PHP.

56
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Somebody had made it as a test token four
years ago and left it in one box.

57
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
We're not going to get that lucky as time
goes on, but there are some cool tokens

58
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
that were made early on that we will
hopefully grab if we do happen to get

59
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
those blocks stuffed in there for that.

60
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
So super, super fun concept. They're kind
of recycling and rebirthing these meme

61
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
projects as storage rent collects them.

62
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Super neat. Do you remember what that
was? Do you remember what that token was

63
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
back then, kushti?

64
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
No, any idea who minted it.

65
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I don't know. He found the wallet. He
found out where it came from, what

66
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
exchange it came from. They brought money
from an exchange and bought ERG from an

67
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
exchange, brought them over and minted the
token and then send the ERG back.

68
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:55,000
And that was it, I think for that
transaction. So specifically who it is.

69
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Yeah, I don't know if you show me
address, maybe I can tell because back

70
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
then there were not many people able to
mint tokens, maybe.

71
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
But actually there were wallets back then
with token minting, so.

72
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Oh, wow. So somebody may have just been
playing around and hit a button and then

73
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
exited kind of thing.

74
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Pretty neat. Yeah. What do it stands for?
If it's like the web PHP or some other.

75
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Who knows, I mean, that's just me today.
But yeah, I mean, there are some addresses

76
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I can tell about, like Scala Hubs, for
example.

77
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,000
And yeah, there were a few other folks
playing with tokens back then.

78
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
But they also could be just some coin
barn wallets user.

79
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:57,000
So yeah, that's what it's supported.
Talking meeting back then.

80
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Okay. Interesting. Very cool.

81
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
So there's that. We also in the mining
pool, we had a fun little bet that I

82
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
offered in chat.

83
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I said if we mine a token within the
first 69 minutes of 2025, I'd donate 50

84
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,000
ERG worth of project tokens to the bonus
token wallet.

85
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
And we found one with like four minutes
to spare.

86
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:31,000
So Mark, I think it's going to be
distributing those over some new, I sent

87
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:37,000
over some Paideia, some air Doge, or no,
some Bober and one of the things as well.

88
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
So Mark should be sending those out soon
to current miners of the Sigmanauts mining

89
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
pool.

90
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Oh, Kevin says Philippines is what PHP
stood for. It must be in the description

91
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
perhaps. Super neat.

92
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:59,000
So he does now Philippines. Yeah, well,
no idea. But yeah, so probably some

93
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Sigmanauts from Philippines then.

94
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Gotcha. So that's Sigmanauts mining DAO.
That's going nice and strong.

95
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Oh, I got a Christmas present, kushti.
And it's like a handheld gaming computer.

96
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
But here's the first thing that I put on
it fully.

97
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Oh, nice.

98
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Yeah, so the thing runs, let me click on
it. The thing will run with controller

99
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:41,000
mapping, which is really handy.

100
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Nice here.

101
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Everything works very nicely, very
smoothly. You can remap the E and the K

102
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
keys. You can car race.

103
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I find it much, much easier on a device
like this.

104
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:59,000
So I can't wait till Cyberverse comes to
mobile.

105
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
That's going to be fantastic.

106
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
And speaking of Cyberverse, they also
have their Ronin Mint coming up on, I

107
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
believe, the January 6th, where they're
doing cross-chain.

108
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Everybody knows they're on Cardano
already, but also the Ronin network, where

109
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
they won that competition and placement
there.

110
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
So there's going to be a mint there. So
if any of you guys want to get some

111
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
exclusive NFTs that are just minted on the
Ronin side, then you can follow their

112
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
tweet and whitelist your wallet.

113
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
And have fun over there as well. Super
cool.

114
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:38,000
But I mean, it's hard to ignore the fact
of what the recognized value of Cyberverse

115
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:44,000
has done since Ronin, since they've won
that competition at Ronin.

116
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
So I'm really interested to see what's
going to happen. Right now there's almost

117
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
a hundred players live on a Cyberverse,
which is quite a high watermark, but I've

118
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
seen.

119
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
So super exciting for that.

120
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
If you have a Steam Deck or one of these
guys, try it out. Remap the keys. It's

121
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
absolutely fantastic.

122
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
It makes mining a breeze when you're
mining Cyberian Ores and watching TV kind

123
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
of thing. It makes it super easy.

124
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Yeah. All right. What else? Sigmanauts
are doing strong with our new multi-sig.

125
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I think we started a transaction to send
some tokens for a little bit of

126
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
liquidation or donation. I think it was as
a vote upon idea that we pass that we're

127
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
just executing.

128
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
So that's going very well.

129
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I've also tried to set myself some goals
for 2025 quarter one at least and that is

130
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
one of them is to help organize the Rosen
Bridge guards a little better see if we

131
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,000
can get some automations there and get
that going as well as some other things

132
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
But yeah, that's pretty much it for the
initial start of the new year trying to

133
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
wipe the sleep off my eyes kushti, what
about you?

134
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
What are your plans besides the blocks?

135
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Yeah, so discussing with developers in
Ergo Developers Group what could be

136
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:15,000
realistic and nice plan for 2025.

137
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Which is, yeah, so what I proposed and
what I'm thinking about is mostly oriented

138
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:35,000
towards what I'm calling peer-to-peer
digital free banking, including options

139
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:45,000
for peer-to-peer smart contracts powered
on ramp for Ergo and also cross-chain

140
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:55,000
tests, which would be huge, especially for
assets which are now well-being ignored,

141
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:05,000
right, censored by centralized exchanges
such as privacy coins, right, and well,

142
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:15,000
proof of work assets to some degree.

143
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Then, yeah, so I think well, with
sub-blocks still, there is need for some

144
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:35,000
layer 2s, right? Well, the only question
is what are desirable properties and

145
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:44,000
what's concrete layer 2s, right? Would be
beneficial.

146
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:53,000
So I think there is I need to start
discussions, right? Well, applications are

147
00:12:53,000 --> 00:13:01,000
already there and we can think about
optimizations about it.

148
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:09,000
But yeah, so the idea is to have, what do
we need to have is peer-to-peer on-ramp,

149
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:17,000
right? Uncensorable, decentralized
on-ramp.

150
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Yeah, I mean, for most of DeFi, the Ergo
network is already working quite fine,

151
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:31,000
right? So, well, getting along in minutes,
right, is already... I mean, in

152
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:38,000
peer-to-peer setting, I mean, like issuing
bonds and getting it filled, like it's

153
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:45,000
already a big deal.

154
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Well, we need for speeds, maybe low fees,
specific use cases like, well, money

155
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:04,000
transfers, right? where some stablecoin
based layer 2s would be beneficial than

156
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:13,000
what's on ramp contracts.

157
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Maybe, but yeah, so if it's about
multi-sig escrow, then yeah, so even

158
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:31,000
current network is enough probably.

159
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,000
So how do peer-to-peer via on-ramps work?

160
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Also, there is a forum post by Mr.
Stahlfeiger on Ergoforum, but basically

161
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:49,000
the idea is to use somewhat like Bisq,
maybe a UI like that, but yeah, with

162
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:55,000
on-chain escrows.

163
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
So we're talking that miners would, let's
take miners for example, if people are

164
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
mining 20, 30 ERG a day with their big
rigs and they have, you know, saved up

165
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
hundreds and thousands of ERG and somebody
comes in on this peer-to-peer fiat arm

166
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
ramp, essentially it'd be a bid.

167
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
They'd say, okay, I'm selling the ERG for
this much or I want to buy the ERG for

168
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
this much.

169
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,000
And the contractor would look for some
off-chain oracle that this cash

170
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,000
transaction happened in the fiat world, so
it would release the ERG? Or how would

171
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,000
that work?

172
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Oh, so, yeah, well, maybe it's better to
put ergoforum post from Mr. Stahlfeiger.

173
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,000
But yeah, basically it's like a multi-sig
escrow, right, from participating in the

174
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,000
exchange.

175
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Yeah, and maybe some arbiter party.

176
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:14,000
So that's how hodl-hodl, for example,
working for Bitcoin.

177
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I see.

178
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
And yeah, so there is need for UI, but
maybe even MewFinance is cross would be

179
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
not.

180
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:32,000
But yeah, I mean, we need to find, we
need to start experimenting and then find,

181
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:39,000
right, so what could be proper UI and
well, concrete schemes around that.

182
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Then, yeah, so transfers, Then there is
need for more stable coins.

183
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,000
There are already talks started about a
new USD pool.

184
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Finally, here people are organizing the

185
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Then there is some work towards silver,
right, oracle.

186
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Then there are plans to tokenize lithium
with also having physical lithium in the

187
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,000
equation.

188
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:31,000
And then, yeah, so with all those assets
and cross-chain assets, the next step I

189
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:38,000
believe is to have well-expanding tools
for well monetary expansion right for

190
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:45,000
expanding monetary supply on top of
monetary base which is about ERG and other

191
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:52,000
blockchains like ChainCash and so on but
yeah that's the next step right so it's a

192
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:59,000
bit later to get done.

193
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
So yeah, well, that's what I have in
mind.

194
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:15,000
But there is a lot of other people in the
community building with different visions.

195
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I don't know, physicals, right? Selling
physical stuff.

196
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Right, right. We just sold, we sold three
Mac, no, four Mac Pros, I believe. We

197
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
shipped one to middle Europe, three to the
US.

198
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,000
And then I just sold my wife's personal
M1 16 inch MacBook Pro from 2021 or two or

199
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,000
whatever that year is. as well because she
got a new one for Christmas it was amazing

200
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,000
it was fantastic I'm actually about to
ship that out today after I leave work to

201
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Western Europe so it's insane how easy it
is to do you know mint a token with the

202
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:54,000
information

203
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Post it up on MewMart and then just wait.

204
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,000
It is interesting though, kushti, it's
kind of a game to where you're like, okay,

205
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,000
do I list it in ERG so that it's more
attractive for people just to swipe it up?

206
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Or do I list it in SigmaUSD because I'm
worried about maybe a 10% price drop or a

207
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,000
10% price increase, and then I'll have to
be listed after that.

208
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
So it's interesting the process of
listing, of choosing what you're going to

209
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
do.

210
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I decided to list in ERG just because it
was easy, and the price did dip a little

211
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
bit from when I listed it.

212
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
But I was watching it and then of course
it went back up now.

213
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
So it doesn't matter in the end but it
was super neat.

214
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:53,000
So yeah, I encourage everybody if you
have items that you want to sell ever and

215
00:19:53,000 --> 00:20:01,000
you want to become a seller talk to HQx at
MewMart and get certified for a seller

216
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I think he's got a robust list of
personal questions about your... No, I'm

217
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
just kidding. I don't know what he asks.

218
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
But it's going to be based on trust, of
course.

219
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
So if you screw people over, you're going
to be pulled immediately.

220
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
And if you're an unknown entity, you're
not going to be probably allowed to list

221
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
there.

222
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
So that's kind of the trust thing there.

223
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
So yeah, I encourage you guys to go there
and look at it I'm gonna probably post

224
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
some more things kicking around my house
and I think we have some Mac minis I said

225
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
here that we can raise money for the
Cornell DAO as well That we can post as

226
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,000
well, you know those kind of they're like
i5 Mac minis with 16 gigs of ram or

227
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
something like that good for good for
little headless servers somewhere Yeah, so

228
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
stay tuned for that physicals are really
really cool.

229
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
It's so nice to not have to you know, I
guess a good thing for the, for the

230
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
seller, at least my wife was saying, oh,
should we, you know, should, do we ship it

231
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
yet?

232
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Do you know the money's not in our bank?

233
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Should we ship it yet?

234
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
And I was like, yeah, yeah, we can ship
it.

235
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I said, the money got sent via a smart
contract.

236
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I mean, it's in my wallet.

237
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
It's not like PayPal can claw back.

238
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
It's there for good.

239
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
You know, so it was a really nice as a
seller to know that, you know, the buyer's

240
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
not going to screw me over at all.

241
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,000
But here, Escrow also could be used,
right?

242
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,000
You could, yeah, 100%. Teller and some
trusted watcher, right?

243
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Yep, yep. Speaking of that too, I spoke
with, speaking of Escrow and fundraising

244
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:45,000
at least, I spoke with Quokka for an
update as well as Crass and

245
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:52,000
And Quokka sent me the front end that
he's been working on that's done

246
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:58,000
essentially for the new Sky Harbor and the
guy working on the smart contracts.

247
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I think the deal was they had an in real
life job that was extremely demanding,

248
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
which I mean, an excuse is an excuse.

249
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
And it's been a while since the
fundraiser.

250
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,000
But I'll keep pushing on them on quokka
to get that out.

251
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
And that brought up another topic,
kushti, about some sort of escrow

252
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
fundraising.

253
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
So the idea would be, at least we
discussed it in the Sigmanauts.

254
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
The idea would be that if you fundraise,
those funds could go into a smart contract

255
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
and then a third party could say, okay,
here's a milestone you've met, we're gonna

256
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
give you a third of the fundraising.

257
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Here's another milestone, we'll give you
another third of the fundraising.

258
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Here's a final done, okay, we'll give you
the last third.

259
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
So I think that's a great way to go in
the future.

260
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Then we're not stuck at these periods
where, hey, where's the product?

261
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
You fundraised eight months ago, and it
should have been done in three months, and

262
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
you still haven't done it kind of thing.

263
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
So we can avoid those things.

264
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Manually, I think Sigmanauts are
positioned to be able to do that right

265
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
now.

266
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
If anybody wants to fundraise as a
project and do that, you can put our

267
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
treasury as the address.

268
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
We can track it actually in a sub
address, a derived address in our

269
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
multi-sig, and we can track it.

270
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
and release based on the terms set in the
auction that people agree to.

271
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
So happy to do that now as Sigmanauts if
anybody wants to fundraise and kind of do

272
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
that.

273
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,000
But of course, probably HQx might be
working on something else as well at some

274
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,000
point, as if he's not busy enough with his
new life kind of thing.

275
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:33,000
So yeah, that's really exciting and super
fun, I think.

276
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Yeah. What time is it? 9.25. We got maybe
got some questions.

277
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Yeah, so not so much updates this week.
There was no developers chat yesterday,

278
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:49,000
obviously.

279
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Yeah, holidays really take a burden on
people, that's for sure.

280
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:03,000
looking forward towards 2025 so it seems
that there is increased interest now and

281
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:11,000
yeah it's getting well more and more hot
topic so

282
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Well, people do understand the value of
decentralized communities, right? Well, it

283
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
seems again.

284
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:26,000
It's funny, kushti, it's funny you say
that, because I think people understand I

285
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:31,000
think people understand their desire for
one, right?

286
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,000
But I don't think they put a definition,
at least mainstream.

287
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
You see influences every once in a while.

288
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
I'd say every week.

289
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,000
There's some sort of eureka moment by
some stupid influencer who's like, oh, you

290
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:48,000
know, if only there was this project that
was decentralized and peer to peer and

291
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:53,000
didn't do rugpulls and didn't do this and
actually had utility and was doing stuff.

292
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:00,000
And it's like, OK, you know the issue,
but you're too daft to understand or

293
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,000
actually participate in the execution of
it, like Ergo and those kind of things.

294
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
So it's funny.

295
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:12,000
I think people recognize the lack, but
slowly, slowly we see them trickling over

296
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:18,000
and making that connection to the actual
realized product, which is Ergo.

297
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:23,000
So I always laugh when I see those posts.

298
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Yeah, so actually, well, I'm
participating now with talks with some big

299
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
influencers, right?

300
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,000
And yeah, it seems that they see value,
right? And all that stuff.

301
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:39,000
The only problem is that they are trying
to extract value as well as they know how

302
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:44,000
to do that, right?

303
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:51,000
So I mean... They do. just to find Ergo
and making a deal so I mean it's quite

304
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:58,000
interesting that they are looking for a
project what they call a blockchain

305
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:05,000
project without basically then they are
trying to make a deal with it right there

306
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:12,000
so

307
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:23,000
That's a little bit skinny. Right. Yeah.
I mean, that's the current state.

308
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:34,000
So I think it would be, we will get back
to 2019, 2020, something like that.

309
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Hopefully in coming months.

310
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:48,000
We need to have all those people, so it's
not just the own issue.

311
00:26:48,000 --> 00:27:01,000
That's how the whole space was shaped in
the last few years.

312
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
For example, centralized exchanges.

313
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:14,000
like everything in the space is just
blockchain with team it's not even to

314
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:24,000
explain them that the different options
then yeah well influence and so on so the

315
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:34,000
so well getting corrupted with it's right
but yeah well I'm quite positive about

316
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Well, what's known in the community,
right?

317
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:48,000
How well, different, mechanism balance
and check forming and, how are different,

318
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:58,000
coming, wouldn't, do, any demo to, to, to,
to eat with, ERG right financial interests

319
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:08,000
or what's the business financial interest
and so on so when i used to be a pro

320
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:18,000
phonics so yeah we had some big guy you
know coming and making calls developed

321
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:28,000
co-co-op receiving for some reason and
well

322
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Half of developers were anonymous, they
made some type instead of jabber chat.

323
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Even in such environment they tried to
get some commitments from co-developers

324
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:57,000
showing the rights of certain players.

325
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:12,000
with a core development space.

326
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Hopefully we will see it here, but we
will prepare anyway.

327
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:30,000
I mean, we need to prepare for a big,
because anyway, they will cut it.

328
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:40,000
And then, yeah, the query is how to avoid
corruption.

329
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Yeah. You're breaking up space. You're
breaking up a little bit, kushti. You want

330
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
to kill some bots on your machine?

331
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Oh, I have a few problems here that are
kind of critical, so probably not now.

332
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Let's continue. I mean, if it's, if it's
okay.

333
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
No, you're okay. You're about 90%. So
it's not terrible. We get what you're

334
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
saying.

335
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Yeah. Back to influences part. I'm
hesitant to, I was hesitant to call them

336
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,000
in floors, influencers when in actuality
they're not influences.

337
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
They're promoters. They're being paid. to
promote a product, whether they believe in

338
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
it or not.

339
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:30,000
I think a true influencer is trend
setting and setting a trend based on what

340
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:35,000
they believe in and what's great and
something that's actually that they're

341
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:40,000
involved in naturally and organically.

342
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
That's an influencer.

343
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:47,000
So these things we see on YouTube and
Twitter, those people are promoters.

344
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
They're paid promoters.

345
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
So it's a really I wish people could see
the difference.

346
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,000
There are people out there that are
influencers that take the time, that

347
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,000
discover things and are doing it because
they actually utilize the product and

348
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
maybe have self invested in the product
because they believe in the product and

349
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
then they preach about it.

350
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
That's an influencer and they set trends.

351
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Most of the stuff we see out there right
now are promoters, that's for sure.

352
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:25,000
It's given me really sour taste for those
kinds of things, at least.

353
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Oh, kushti, we have to pick some random
numbers for the ErgoSanta for MewFinance

354
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:35,000
right now.

355
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:42,000
All right. All right. Yeah. So it's got
to be the range.

356
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Why don't you pick a number from 25 and a
half to 50 and I'll pick a number from one

357
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:58,000
to 25. and a half you ready so from 25 to
50 yeah you go 25 to 50 I'll go one to 25

358
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:06,000
all right let me think so you start on me
I'll go first I'm going to pick 13 all

359
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:14,000
right 13 is my number what's yours kushti

360
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:21,000
13, so let's... 25 to 51.

361
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:28,000
25 to 51, so 48.

362
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
All right, 13 and 48, there you go, HQx.

363
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
So for those of you that don't know,
ErgoSanta is a fun little thing that's

364
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
been running for a couple years now.

365
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:41,000
People donate things to projects and
people donate things to an address.

366
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
And then you go and buy tickets and you
open those tickets and it's part of that

367
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
distribution.

368
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
And then there's some grand prizes.

369
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:54,000
So we just drew the random tickets.

370
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:02,000
I'm wrong, HQx? Oh, whatever. 13 and
what'd you say 48 kushti? 48 yeah yeah so

371
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:10,000
yeah perfect all right yes h here we got
you 51 buddy

372
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Perfect. Great.

373
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
All right, what's next? Should we try to
hit some questions, kushti? Let's see what

374
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
we have.

375
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Oh yeah, let's try.

376
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Okay. I've been told to stop swearing
because kids are watching. Noted white

377
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
cat.

378
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:30,000
I will refrain from the field of F's that
I've been saying.

379
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Let's see. We have, Jonas, Jonas would
like to know, do we have multi-sig wallets

380
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:40,000
on Ergo?

381
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:45,000
We do. We do. We have a very cool
multi-sig called Minotaur right now, which

382
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,000
is on version two.

383
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Huge upgrade from version one.

384
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
They're still, I think, in the pipeline
working on built-in messaging so that you

385
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
don't have to manually transfer the
signatures to each other with Google

386
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Sheets or something else like that.

387
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
or the commitments, but it works very
well.

388
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,000
We just did a transaction test a couple
weeks ago on version two of the Sigmanauts

389
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,000
treasury.

390
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
We pounded it out in like 30 minutes
after some struggles with learning, but

391
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
it's pretty good.

392
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
And then kushti, we also have MGPi is
kind of on the back burner, but he's

393
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
developed a multi-sig called Moria.

394
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
which is a web-based multi-sig.

395
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,000
You go there, you connect Nautilus to it,
and right now I think it's a test version

396
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,000
of Nautilus, a special build, because
there had to be a little tweak to it to

397
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
work.

398
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
So you connect that to it, and that's
your signing key, and the server handles

399
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
the rest of the stuff.

400
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,000
So you sign, it tells you who's next, and
then they sign, it tells you who's next,

401
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,000
it stores it all, and then it submits it
for you.

402
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,000
That will be a much, much easier
multi-sig experience than Minotaur and

403
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,000
passing the signing keys around or the
signing JSON around yourself after you

404
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
sign it.

405
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
But I think we're waiting on some code
being inserted into the final build of the

406
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
production.

407
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Yeah, there is need for centralized
server here.

408
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
I know. Yeah, there is.

409
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Yeah. But yeah, I think there is also
some alternative work on multisig server,

410
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:29,000
right, for Nautilus, but I've forgotten.

411
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Maybe by Captain Nemo even.

412
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:44,000
I mean, well, the trick is centralization
of holding those JSON signatures and

413
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:49,000
commits while it's in the process.

414
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
So for those of you that don't know how
multi-sigs work, you have a wallet that's

415
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,000
your signing key that's essentially your
password, right?

416
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,000
And then it combines all those public
keys of your signing keys and creates a

417
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,000
smart contract that's the multi-sig that
only allows threshold spending based on

418
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,000
four out of seven, three out of six, three
out of five, depending on how many yes

419
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,000
signatures you need to push it forward.

420
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,000
So there's two rounds in these scenarios.

421
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,000
There's a commit round where you sign it.

422
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
And then there's a signing round where
you continue back up the tree and you sign

423
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,000
again to actually sign it after the
commit.

424
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,000
And then the last person in line
publishes it.

425
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:35,000
So the idea is you have to pass around
this sometimes you know, 50,000 character

426
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:40,000
string of JSON file, and it builds as
people tack their signatures on.

427
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,000
So right now, we use Google Sheets for
Minotaur and most of the multi-sigs that

428
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,000
I'm part of, and you just paste it in the
cell and you copy the previous one and you

429
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:53,000
do that and you copy the previous one,
paste it in, that kind of thing.

430
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:00,000
So that works, but sometimes when you
have a lot of outputs, and a lot of

431
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:06,000
inputs, you run into a 50,000 character
limit in a cell in Google Docs.

432
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:12,000
So then for the old Sigmanauts multi-sig
that we had to extract everything out of

433
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:18,000
to the new one, we ended up just passing a
text file around in the chat.

434
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Yeah, there's the issue of, like Moria
Finance, do you centralize that process

435
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,000
and go from there?

436
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Or do you develop some sort of on-chain
messaging system, which I thought was

437
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Captain Nemo's or Minotaur's idea that
they would try to implement something like

438
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:42,000
that in the future where there's some sort
of on-chain messaging where maybe the JSON

439
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:47,000
is submitted to a block and that's looked
for and brought up there kind of thing, or

440
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:52,000
maybe it just hits a mempool and then
vanishes, who knows?

441
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,000
It could be anything, but yeah,
definitely trade-offs in that, kushti.

442
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:02,000
I mean, what are the chances that if I
start a commit, kushti, and I'm multising,

443
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:08,000
there is not much a centralized entity
could do to screw with it, right?

444
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,000
If before the next person commits to it,
right? They would be known that it was

445
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,000
messed with or could it be messed with
along the pathway?

446
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Yeah, but so you know what's good about
multi-sig and Ergo.

447
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,000
So what makes it unique in comparison
with other blockchains?

448
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:30,000
So here is threshold signatures is real
cryptographic threshold signature.

449
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,000
So it is preserving zero knowledge,
right?

450
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:39,000
So for example, if there is you, me and
Joe in a signing rig and two out of three

451
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:45,000
signatures are needed, right?

452
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
And you and me are signing them.

453
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Not any external observer knows that,
right?

454
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,000
And if we are doing that complicated
procedure, then yeah, well, this privacy

455
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:59,000
is preserved, right, in the ring.

456
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
So only three of us.

457
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:07,000
I actually know, right, who are your real
signers, right?

458
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Because, well, in this case, Joe also
knows that, you know, he didn't sign.

459
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:19,000
And then, yeah, it's possible to conclude
who are the signers.

460
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:25,000
But, yeah, it's not possible to prove,
maybe, but you need to check, actually.

461
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:30,000
I mean, Joe cannot prove that to outside
world.

462
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
But I need to check that.

463
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:37,000
I mean, if just two of us were in the
signing ceremony.

464
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:46,000
But yeah, so the server also knows,
right, who are the miners for real.

465
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:53,000
So in addition to Moria and Minotaur
wallets, which is usable and actually

466
00:39:53,000 --> 00:40:00,000
quite good right now, I'm using it.

467
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,000
So there is also alt application, desktop
application, zero knowledge treasury,

468
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,000
which can be used.

469
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:11,000
It's kind of simple DAO tooling, so you
can create proposals there.

470
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:22,000
And yeah, basically what with
multi-signature.

471
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Is that what the EF used?

472
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Not yet, so it was used by some Dark
Funds, Zero Funds, which was made of me,

473
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Philippo Units, Martin MX, back in 2020.

474
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,000
So we donated some money, received some
donations to support some privacy-oriented

475
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,000
projects on Ergo.

476
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:54,000
And yeah, so this tooling is using
multi-sig for kind of voting rights.

477
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:00,000
So you can create proposal and then,
yeah, other signers are signing or not.

478
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:05,000
And if enough signatures collected, then
payment is done.

479
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:09,000
So kind of a very simple DAO tooling,
actually.

480
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:13,000
And yeah, also with preserving privacy of
waters, which is quite, quite interesting

481
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:17,000
also.

482
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Speaking of privacy, kushti, I saw a
question on the line yesterday. I think it

483
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:30,000
was. They're running the open source tool
mixer.

484
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
And they're wondering if they could
change the hops after they've already

485
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
submitted.

486
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
So if they wanted to augment or increase
the amount of hops it takes while they're

487
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,000
in the middle of a mix, do they have to
wait for the mix to finish?

488
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Or can they change that on the fly?

489
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Do you know? Have you ever come across
that before?

490
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Yeah, so I think you need to wait and
start a new mix.

491
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Gotcha. Okay. That makes sense.

492
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:04,000
All right, let's see. White cat wants to
know is Dan still in the team?

493
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,000
I'm not sure what he means by in the team
in the team. He's an Ergonaut or not.

494
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Yeah. Dan's sleepy. It's like 2 a.m. In
Japan right now.

495
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:17,000
And Dan's been doing a lot of traveling
to Argentina, for the lithium, lithium

496
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:21,000
mining kind of stuff that they're working
on with Palmyra.

497
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
So Dan is very much around.

498
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,000
I wished him a happy new year, Merry
Christmas.

499
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
And he was alive and well.

500
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:34,000
So I think he's in Japan right now.

501
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:40,000
So I think he, I think he got back near
Christmas time or so.

502
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Yeah. Dan and Japan. Yep.

503
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,000
So we'll try to have Dan on again. It's
interesting, because either people hate

504
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Dan or they ask where he is.

505
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,000
There's never an in between for Dan.

506
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,000
So this will make Dan happy that he's
wanted by white cat.

507
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:01,000
I'm going to picture this and make an NFT
out of it for Dan.

508
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:06,000
All right, let's see. Oh, here we go.
qx() and kushti, what are you guys

509
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:11,000
grateful for on this new year period?

510
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,000
This is from Gabno.

511
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,000
What are you grateful for, kushti? On or
off chain?

512
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Is it the question?

513
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Yeah, yeah. What are you grateful for? On
or off chain?

514
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Well, he didn't say, so I'm going to say,
I'm going to leave it open for you.

515
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:37,000
I mean, what do I prefer on chain? What
do you think?

516
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,000
What are you thankful for in life and in
crypto in your experience with crypto in

517
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,000
life?

518
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Give just what do you what are you
thankful for? Are grateful for? I'll go

519
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:51,000
first.

520
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,000
You want me to go first?

521
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Yeah, so still, well, what I'm interested
in is, yeah, to have crypto for real, you

522
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:07,000
know, so for like, I don't know, so, you
know, there are a lot of interesting

523
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:13,000
experiments in how to call this even, like
virtual space, you know, like, I don't

524
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:19,000
know.

525
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Well, those games like CryptoKitties,
then what do we have?

526
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:43,000
like i don't know so some tokens with
meme coins without utility and so on,

527
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:49,000
right?

528
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:58,000
But yeah, so what's good, what I'm
interested in connecting, right?

529
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Like, well, cryptography and
cryptographic assets, cryptographically

530
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:12,000
secure assets with real world, you know,
needs.

531
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,000
So that's the most interesting thing.

532
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,000
So then, yeah, cryptography per se, but
yeah, I mean, there is need for

533
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,000
applications, right?

534
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Otherwise you can spend decades with just
playing fancy.

535
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:36,000
games here like I don't know like
iterating our different cryptographic

536
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:42,000
schemes and so on like well discussing the
properties maybe proving something coming

537
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:48,000
up with the new schemes and so on but

538
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Yeah, I mean at some point I think there
is need for real-world applications

539
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:06,000
otherwise it's just I don't know so it's
about getting grants or just I don't know

540
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:14,000
some game in isolated space which is not
very interesting to me.

541
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:21,000
But then, yeah, also, well, software
development programming. But yeah, it's

542
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:28,000
also that there is need for real-world
applications.

543
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,000
All right, cool. Cool.

544
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,000
I would say I'm most grateful for the
time that we're, I guess, the timeline

545
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,000
we're in, right?

546
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:48,000
So sometimes I think, you know, it's hard
because, how do I put it? How do I put it?

547
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:53,000
You know, this is something totally new
and totally like, even though it's new,

548
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:58,000
it's still, and we have a lot of adoption
in the meme space and the speculation

549
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:03,000
space.

550
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Ergo is even kind of still true and new
to that.

551
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,000
So here we are kind of swimming against
currents of these things that degrade what

552
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:16,000
cryptography is and degrade what actual
these decentralized and peer-to-peer

553
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:20,000
financial tools are.

554
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:26,000
And we're fighting against that all the
time.

555
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:30,000
I don't know how many times I've been
somewhere and somebody will say something

556
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:34,000
like, oh, somebody got scammed on crypto
or look at this scammy crypto.

557
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,000
When they look at me, I'm like, That's
not what I do.

558
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,000
You know what I do is totally different
than these other kind of things that

559
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,000
you're hearing about.

560
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:51,000
So then I think about like how hard it is
to start these kind of new revolutions.

561
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:56,000
We're bucking against a system that's
been in place for a long time by very

562
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:01,000
powerful forces.

563
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:06,000
So here we are trying to come up with and
promote and encourage actual value that is

564
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:11,000
owned by people themselves, as opposed to
being at the will of people who have more

565
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:16,000
power and money than you.

566
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
So that's going to be another current
that we're hitting as well.

567
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:22,000
So I'm grateful that I can experience
that and we can experience that all of us

568
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:26,000
as part of Ergo right now in this
timeline, right?

569
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:33,000
So this is, this is a hard part. This is
like the fight. This is the struggle

570
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:39,000
where, you know, you see in the past
people give up and that's it.

571
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,000
And then some things never, you know,
keeps going.

572
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,000
That's where we're at. I feel in Ergo
because we're fighting against the general

573
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:50,000
idea that we need safety, we need some
bank to hold our funds and be responsible

574
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:54,000
for them for us.

575
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,000
We're fighting against a current of crap
tokens and meme projects that are just

576
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,000
extracting value and scams.

577
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,000
So it's not easy.

578
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:09,000
But at the same time, I'm grateful that
we're here to experience that because it

579
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:14,000
just strengthens my resolve that this kind
of stuff is what's important and what we

580
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:19,000
need.

581
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:26,000
All right, let's see. Oh, HQx messed up,
kushti.

582
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:30,000
He's 61 entries.

583
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
So we have to take 61 and divide it by
two.

584
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
So 30 and a half.

585
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Why don't you go from 30 and a half to 61
and I'll go from one to 30 and a half.

586
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:45,000
I'm going to take 27 is my number.

587
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
Oh, but mine is still the same.

588
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:52,000
So you'll stay at 48. Okay.

589
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Okay. So 27 and 48. There you go. HQx.
We've done it legitimately.

590
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:03,000
So we have the NFT wizard, new to the
channel has a few questions. What's the

591
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:09,000
high level mission statement of Ergo?

592
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:15,000
You want to take that question?

593
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:23,000
High-level mission statement of Ergo. So,
yeah, well, there is Ergo Manifesto,

594
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:31,000
right, about that in particular, and we
are doing Ergo Book to include more

595
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:39,000
materials, like Grassroots Manifesto,
which is not so-so known, right, by Joe.

596
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:53,000
So I think in very short, the idea here
is to provide grassroots-based

597
00:50:53,000 --> 00:51:05,000
counter-cyclical tools in the form of
peer-to-peer digital free banking.

598
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:10,000
which means a lot of things when you are
going to unwrap it, such as unsensorable

599
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:15,000
nature of interactions, right?

600
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:23,000
And then, yeah, well, you need to have
features which usually only banks have,

601
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:30,000
you know, even more.

602
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:36,000
You have your, well, passing money
emission rights to these peer-to-peer free

603
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:42,000
bankings.

604
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:47,000
So not commercial banks we have now,
which are emitting most of money and so

605
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:51,000
on.

606
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Then it means new principles of emission
and so on.

607
00:51:54,000 --> 00:52:01,000
So yeah, like hundreds of different
things, but yeah, in very short, well, the

608
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:08,000
mission is like that.

609
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Well, to me, I guess.

610
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
So what about you?

611
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:17,000
To me? Yeah, I would say a lot of that, a
lot of what Ergo's high level mission to

612
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:23,000
me is what I just spoke about earlier in
my rant about five minutes ago.

613
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:27,000
I think I think humanity at least has
gone through a period of uneducation,

614
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:31,000
right?

615
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:36,000
The removal of self-custody and the
removal of the importance of that.

616
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:44,000
They've traded comfort or power over
themselves and their own entities, right?

617
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:49,000
So, like I said, they've traded the
ability to know that if they screw up or

618
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:54,000
if they put their credit card number on a
wrong site, they can call their bank and

619
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:59,000
say, this was a fraud, and that kind of
thing, and get it pulled back.

620
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
So there's comfort in that, right?

621
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:06,000
I think the opposite should be true.

622
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,000
I think we need to re-educate, and it's a
slow, long road.

623
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
And I think there goes a position to do
that, as well as perhaps some other

624
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
projects.

625
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:21,000
re-educate that you're in control of your
funds on a network that I can trade and

626
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:28,000
create value for with everybody else in
the world, right?

627
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:32,000
So that means if I screw up, I screw up.

628
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
And it's a hard lesson to learn, right?

629
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:38,000
But it's gonna be a lot of that early on,
I think.

630
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
So I think Ergo facilitates that.

631
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Ergo facilitates and puts the power back
into the people's hands.

632
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:49,000
It allows somebody like myself to run a
Rosen Bridge watcher and verify on chain

633
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:54,000
that funds are being transferred in a
certain method and release those funds to

634
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:59,000
other people, essentially.

635
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:05,000
It allows me to go on to a decentralized
peer-to-peer website like SigmaFi.

636
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:10,000
and loan somebody, you know, a thousand
SigmaUSD.

637
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:15,000
or going to DuckPools and dump my
SigmaUSD into the DuckPools pool to earn

638
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:20,000
interest on it that nobody can really stop
because it's a smart contract.

639
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,000
So those kind of things are super
invaluable to me and Ergo facilitates that

640
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,000
100%.

641
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:32,000
It puts the power of finance back into
the people's hands that's been

642
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:37,000
intentionally de-educated, uneducated,
this is a word I'm thinking of but I can't

643
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:42,000
think of it, over the years, intentionally
to keep people in control, in control and

644
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:47,000
continuing to make money off that.

645
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Like I just saw the other day, yesterday,
right?

646
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:57,000
I saw the other day that a bank right a
bank that already makes interest off the

647
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:01,000
money that you put into it right so you
put money into a bank they invest your

648
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:05,000
money lend it out correct so a bank is
just had an announcement the other day

649
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:09,000
that a lot of banks do this of course with
with their pro checking accounts but

650
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:13,000
typically they have a free level of
checking account but they're removing

651
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:17,000
their free level of checking account and
making it so that you had to either direct

652
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:21,000
deposit into the account

653
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:26,000
or you had to carry a balance over like a
thousand dollars or they charge you a

654
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:30,000
certain amount for a month like that is
insane like this is exactly why

655
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:34,000
self-custody is important right where
they're already making money off the money

656
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:38,000
that we put in there and now they're just
pulling more and extracting more value out

657
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:42,000
of the money that you've earned that
you've put in there so

658
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Hopefully, crypto will change that.

659
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Hopefully, Ergo will be part of that, the
drive there.

660
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:54,000
It certainly has positioned itself to do
so.

661
00:55:54,000 --> 00:56:00,000
And it's proven itself over the last four
or five years that it's resilient.

662
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:04,000
And it doesn't matter about market
conditions on the outside or perception of

663
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:08,000
crypto as a whole.

664
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,000
That's what Ergo does.

665
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:15,000
So that's my rant, kushti.

666
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:19,000
All right.

667
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:23,000
I think, I think we've hit all the
questions. well, is Keystone integrated.

668
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:27,000
Do you have an update on Keystone? Do we
know?

669
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,000
Is that C8 that's working on Keystone?

670
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Yeah, there's, there's updates one week.
Oh, fine. It's, but well, it's, it's still

671
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:47,000
as far as I know. recently,

672
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Well, it's with deterministic signatures
solved for the consistent environment.

673
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:00,000
And then, yeah, Keystone. So, latest
update. Making good progress with the

674
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Keystone integration.

675
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:14,000
SDK part is mostly 10 PR is opened
against the case.

676
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Still being in the final push of
displaying transactions, signing data and

677
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:24,000
testing.

678
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:31,000
Pull request can mount here. Some link,
but is not updated for the latest changes.

679
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:38,000
So yeah, it's still quite well.

680
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Did you see the nice, the nice design on
Twitter the other day with the Ergo logo

681
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,000
across the back of the Keystone?

682
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:48,000
That was pretty nice looking.

683
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:55,000
Yeah. Yeah. And the view is selling, I
believe, Keystone pieces with something

684
00:57:55,000 --> 00:58:02,000
like that are going to, do you know what's
going on?

685
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
I don't know. I think it was just a
promotion. I don't think it's live yet,

686
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
right?

687
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,000
I'll buy one as soon as it is.

688
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:18,000
Oh, so, yeah. It's all right. Yeah. All
right.

689
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Well, 10 o'clock, I got another meeting
to run to kushti. I think your mic's

690
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
starting to finally break up a little bit.

691
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:30,000
So I think it's a good time to end it for
the new year right on time.

692
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:35,000
All right. Bye guys. Thanks everybody for
joining. Ciao.

693
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:38,000
Bye guys.
