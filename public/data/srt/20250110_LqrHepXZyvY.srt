1
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, everybody.

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Long time no talk.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Seems like I haven't spoken to you guys
since last year.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
And that's probably because I haven't.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So it's the first AMA that I am on for
this year.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Glad to be here.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
And so with me, of course, I have kushti.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Say hi to everybody, kushti.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Hey, everyone.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
How's it going?

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
All right, so what's been happening?

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Tell me what's been happening.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I've been away, I feel like I've been
away forever.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Yeah, so Happy New Year, Happy Orthodox
Christmas.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
And before it was, how's it called?

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Protestants, Catholic Christmas, I don't
know.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Probably both, right?

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
And yeah, so soon in three weeks, we will
have Chinese New Year.

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
So a long holiday season.

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
All right, so a lot of things going on.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I believe on your side as well, right?

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
So how is Lithos flowing?

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Right, right.

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
So we have quite a lot of smart contract
dissection and the auditing and things

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,000
like that happening right now.

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
So this is with Palmyra and we've been
going over our, well we're getting all the

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
smart contracts audited right now. We have
several utilities going on live. We're

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
gonna have the full traceability suite
also being basically going online and

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
going live and we're introducing a new
product that is going to be utilizing it

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
heavily.

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
So we have to make sure that everything
is working right.

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
And it is, there's no big issues or
anything like that.

33
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
But it's going to be really exciting
because we're going to have a new product,

34
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
part of the Palmyra platform that is going
to utilize the blockchain for traceability

35
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
on a more regular basis.

36
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
So that's exciting.

37
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Now from the lithium side, so that's also
very interesting thing that we've been

38
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
doing right now.

39
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
So the first thing that we started
working on, well, I think the first of

40
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
many vectors, of many vertices that we've
been pursuing in Argentina is the

41
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
decentralized lithium pricing index.

42
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,000
And so this is actually going to be an
opportunity to utilize Ergo oracles

43
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,000
because there's going to be a need for
many different types of oracles.

44
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And it's basically going to be kind of
almost a fee market type of system.

45
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
And the oracles, various different
oracles are just going to have a chance to

46
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
participate and to utilize a reward
system.

47
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:35,000
And so to kind of give the basic
breakdown of what it is.

48
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
With commodity trading, there's a lot of
times, most of the time, in fact, pretty

49
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
much all the time, with major commodities
out there like gold, silver, copper,

50
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
there's an index.

51
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
There's a unified pricing index that
basically says that the price of gold

52
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
today is this much.

53
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
LBMA gold, for example, and this is where
everybody goes and checks and trades and

54
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
kind of knows what's going on.

55
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
This does not exist for lithium, and as
weird as it is, as big as lithium is, this

56
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
does not exist for lithium.

57
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,000
There are many separate pricing indexes,
but they're fragmented.

58
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
There's one for the LME and the CME, the
London Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago

59
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Mercantile Exchange.

60
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
There are some that are being tracked by
the S&P.

61
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
In fact, our partners, Atómico Tres, they
are actually the ones that report to the

62
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
S&P.

63
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
They're the pricing providers for the
S&P.

64
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
And so it's pretty fragmented.

65
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
And so what happens is, because it's so
fragmented, it gives a lot of room for

66
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
price manipulation.

67
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
And so there's regions out there that are
less than honest about their price

68
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
reporting.

69
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
And so they try to manipulate the price
to make the price go up to get things

70
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
going along more so they can make more
money.

71
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
And so this screws it up for everybody.

72
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
And that's why there's no unified price
index because you don't really know who to

73
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
trust.

74
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:32,000
And so you only can go to only a select
few parties that you can trust.

75
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:40,000
And so this presents an opportunity to
create a unified price index that is going

76
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:48,000
to be utilizing a reputational scoring
system, and also utilize a specific

77
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:56,000
algorithm that was designed by Atómico
Tres that will actually basically

78
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:04,000
compensate for expected price manipulation
and kind of balance things out.

79
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
And so we're going to be putting that
into effect.

80
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
And so for this, we need oracles.

81
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
These different oracles, they need to
basically, they're going to be getting all

82
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
these price feeds from all over the world,
and they're going to need to bring those

83
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
price feeds on chain.

84
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
for the protocol to be able to average it
out.

85
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
And so there's going to be a lot of
opportunity out there for this.

86
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
And so for the price oracles, so how is
this going to make money?

87
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
The way it's going to make money is it's
actually going to be like a Bloomberg

88
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
terminal, which is a subscription service.

89
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
And so there's many different parties
that are looking for this.

90
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
They're looking for a clear, unified
price index.

91
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
And this one is going to be
decentralized.

92
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
It's going to be on chain.

93
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
It's going to be auditable.

94
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Very transparent, and this will attract
players into this ecosystem to utilize

95
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
this.

96
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Because like I said, this is a big
problem in the industry.

97
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
So decentralization is going to be a big
aspect of it.

98
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
And so the fees are going to be coming in
from people utilizing this.

99
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
And then these fees are going to be
partially distributed to the various

100
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
different oracles that are in the
ecosystem.

101
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:27,000
So hence, you will have this really
healthy Oracle ecosystem that is going to

102
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:33,000
be supplying information and bringing it
on chain.

103
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
So it's a very exciting project.

104
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
So we're at the end of the preliminary
planning stages right now.

105
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
We're going to start banging out some
code and some prototypes really soon.

106
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
And yeah, I'm really excited, like I
said, because it gives us the ability to

107
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
utilize various different types of
Oracles, including our Ergo Oracles.

108
00:07:53,000 --> 00:08:00,000
And it'll also give incentives for people
to spin up more oracles.

109
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
So yeah, just a really exciting project
to be able to spin up.

110
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
And that's not all.

111
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
That's only the beginning.

112
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I can go on about all this other stuff.

113
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
But that is really the first thing on our
plate right now.

114
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:21,000
So yeah, that's what's been going on in
the world of lithium and whatnot.

115
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
So, yeah, how about you, kushti?

116
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I mean, what's been going on in the
ecosystem?

117
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Yeah, first of all, that's quite
exciting.

118
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
So I think, yeah, Oracle pools is quite
natural design for multiple oracles,

119
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
right?

120
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
So submitting lithium prices.

121
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
And then, yeah, it would be good to have
lithium-based stable coins, right, for

122
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
different purposes.

123
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
So for clearing physical lithium and so
on.

124
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
So yeah, that's quite exciting.

125
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:00,000
So this will actually give us a base.

126
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
It's actually really neat. A tool to
create then the lithium stable coin that

127
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
we've been talking about, because we'll be
able to then get these unified price

128
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
feeds, so we're not going to have to kind
of guess who's giving us the right

129
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
information, who's not.

130
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
So yeah, it's a big, big value add I
think and that's why we're starting with

131
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
this and not with the stable coin.

132
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
We're starting with the lithium index
because there's going to be an immediate

133
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
impact with it.

134
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Right so yeah actually that makes a lot
of sense that's how we started with Ergo

135
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:40,000
actually so we started with oracles right
oracle pool design and then yes stablecoin

136
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:47,000
followed so that's yeah understandable
especially if there is no well established

137
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:54,000
price feed right as you told I mean if
there are multiple sources of truth then

138
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:01,000
yeah the first question is which one to
project on the blockchain right right yeah

139
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:08,000
that's yeah very interesting so in regards
with Ergo ecosystem so

140
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Yeah, well, it's like, you know, there
are no holidays, so a lot of updates.

141
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:31,000
So, yeah, well, in the first place, I've
published, well, a near final draft of

142
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:40,000
sub-blocks CIP, right, and doing some
prototyping codes now.

143
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:48,000
So that would bring maximum performance
possible for proof of work peer-to-peer

144
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:55,000
network right real peer-to-peer network
and real proof of work so the design is

145
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:02,000
based on distinction between input blocks
and ordering blocks and I believe for

146
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:09,000
other networks also going this direction,
right, like Cardano.

147
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:20,000
So I've heard that they also are planning
to use similar structure, but also well in

148
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:31,000
touch with Bitcoin Cash folks, developers
and so on.

149
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:40,000
They even have guys well somehow
associated with Bitcoin Cash, even have

150
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:48,000
some papers published on quite similar
design called Tailstorm.

151
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
And so on.

152
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
So, yeah, it seems different.

153
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Ideas are converging, which is not
surprising considering that we are in mid

154
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
2020s, right?

155
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,000
So, well, this field is established quite
well now if we are talking about

156
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,000
peer-to-peer networking and consensus.

157
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Well, still a lot of things going on in
regards with cryptography.

158
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
So we had extensive chat before New Year.

159
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
So that's for you then, probably not for
community.

160
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:33,000
So, well, we had a community chat on
post-quantum options, right, which was

161
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:42,000
quite hot topic in December because of
some new quantum hardware appeared.

162
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Then there are actually a lot of new
cryptographic schemes appearing like every

163
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
day.

164
00:12:51,000 --> 00:13:00,000
So just yesterday there was a new
announcement of well-efficient zero

165
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:09,000
knowledge scheme for incremental
verifiable computation called Micronova.

166
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:19,000
It's quite efficient even for validating
proofs in Ethereum contracts.

167
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:29,000
It could be adopted for verifying
something on Ergo as well.

168
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:39,000
So checking stuff like that and then yeah
so for our 6.0 well there is a security

169
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:49,000
audit ongoing right now so well Dusek
found a few issues to the moment, so I'm

170
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:59,000
finishing working on fixes and then we
will have public testnet deployments.

171
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:10,000
So, well, protocol client version for
public testnet 6.0 client, I mean, will be

172
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:21,000
published around the beginning of the next
week, if no more issues will be found.

173
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Then, preparing also new minor releases
for Sigma interpreter and the protocol

174
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:36,000
client.

175
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:45,000
So Sigma interpreter will contain a new
ErgoScript function, basically a form of

176
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:54,000
macros for, well, deserializing well,
typed scripts, which is useful to do kind

177
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:03,000
of P2SH contracts even in ErgoScript, so
before they were made in ErgoTree, so kind

178
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:12,000
of low-level language.

179
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Now it's possible to use, well, all that
stuff.

180
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:22,000
like P2SH contracts in a higher level.

181
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Language also, Merkle trees, finance
state machines and so on.

182
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
So actually a lot of exciting stuff.

183
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Then, yeah, a lot of things going on in
the community as usually.

184
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:48,000
So, just few days ago, liquidity pool was
launched for the first storage rent meme

185
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:57,000
coin, PHP, so someone minted PHP coin back
in 2020 and four years after miners

186
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:06,000
collected the whole supply of it and then
it was relaunched as a meme coin which is

187
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:15,000
quite interesting that you can recycle
tokens being lost and may make them meme

188
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:24,000
coins even.

189
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Then a lot of things going on in
MewFinance land.

190
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Check the vibrant community, the groups.

191
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
A lot of things going on there.

192
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Then, well, there is community attempt to
launch Oracle Pool version 2.0 based

193
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:05,000
oracle pool for USD so yeah well there is
a group for that please join also if you

194
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:16,000
want to participate and

195
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Yes, so in Dexy developers group we are
now talking how to deliver UI that there

196
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:37,000
is need for contributors to finish,
publish UI and to launch Dexy Gold.

197
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Finally, then hopefully Dexy USD and Dexy
lithium and so on Dexy silver so for

198
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:59,000
silver well connectors done so well now
it's time to launch an oracle pool

199
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:09,000
There is some progress with Nautilus
mobile.

200
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Finally, a contract is signed with a
counterparty.

201
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Audits of ledger code, so hopefully in a
few weeks then Ergo will be in Ledger

202
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Live.

203
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Keystone integration also going quite
well.

204
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
There is initial draft of PR in the
repository and IgniFox is working on

205
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
completing that.

206
00:18:52,000 --> 00:19:04,000
There are some positive news about
Binance Smart Chain Bridge testing.

207
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
And so on.

208
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:12,000
So a lot of news, well, getting on my
radar.

209
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:18,000
So probably much more is happening.

210
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:27,000
So check the updates published weekly and
check community groups and so on.

211
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:33,000
So yeah, well, it's quite busy time
despite holidays.

212
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Yeah, it seems like I'm not as active as
I was a few months ago actually in the

213
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:45,000
ecosystem, although we're obviously still
working on Ergo tech.

214
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:52,000
So we're obviously active, I'm just not
as hands-on as I used to be.

215
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Which is unfortunate, but I hope that in
this new year, I will have more time to

216
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,000
really kind of be hands on again,
especially with this bull market coming.

217
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I think there's going to be a lot more
excitement coming in.

218
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:14,000
We can participate in some ErgoHack plus
of course, mgPai is now in the EF.

219
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:20,000
So we have our own part of being part of
the EF.

220
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
which is cool.

221
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Yeah, yeah, it's very exciting to see.

222
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Actually, I was approached by a
Argentinian firm that is looking to mine

223
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Ergo, and so we're trying to figure out
how we can make it work.

224
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:46,000
It's a Bitcoin mining operation, and they
actually have a huge like a huge

225
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,000
operation, huge hash rate, but a lot of it
is ASIC.

226
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:58,000
And so they can't use ASICs for Ergo, so
they do have non-ASIC mining rigs, not as

227
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:04,000
many, but some.

228
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
They're still very interested in mining
it, especially since we're building on

229
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Ergo.

230
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,000
That's something that I'm really looking
forward to bringing into our ecosystem

231
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,000
once that progresses more, but we need to
talk a little bit more about me and you,

232
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,000
kushti, and I'm also talking to I was
talking to qx() about it.

233
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Who else was I talking to about it?

234
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
A couple of people.

235
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Yeah, so we'll figure it out and we'll
get them to participate in the ecosystem.

236
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
So it's super exciting.

237
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
So we got some questions here.

238
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Let's get to them, I guess.

239
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Well, I mean, we got this.

240
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Yeah.

241
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:57,000
And so for miners and so on, yeah, it
would be good.

242
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:02,000
So currently a lot of discussions how to
get more players in the ecosystem because,

243
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,000
well, it's what's making it actually
decentralized, right?

244
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:17,000
So, well, decentralization is not about,
like centralized team consisting of devs

245
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:26,000
cable connected with, I don't know, VCs,
maybe even producer.

246
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
talking about decentralization.

247
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:34,000
But yeah, well, it's about many players,
right?

248
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Well, it's good to have many big players,
right, in the ecosystem.

249
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:47,000
And then the question is how to onboard
them and how to make them...

250
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:54,000
It's a bit challenging because so many
are just set up for ASIC mining.

251
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Even though they want to come to Ergo, a
lot of times it's a bit challenging.

252
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:10,000
These particular guys actually, they said
that they actually see a lot of potential

253
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:16,000
in Ergo and they don't mind that they're
not going to be making a killing doing it

254
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:22,000
right now because they know that it's
going to increase and there's going to be

255
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:28,000
a lot of opportunity there for miners
going into this market right now.

256
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:36,000
So yeah, like I said, we'll figure it
out.

257
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
I guess the will is there.

258
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
We'll find a way.

259
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
So, yeah, good.

260
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:52,000
So, yeah, well, we need to get more and
more big players in the ecosystem, right?

261
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Yeah, and these guys are big, like I
said.

262
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Like these guys are actually pretty big.

263
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Like I said, the problem is that they
just don't have that many non-ASICs

264
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,000
machines.

265
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Like most of their mining operation is
ASICs, so it's...

266
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Yeah, but they do have some, we'll make
those work and then we'll see maybe what

267
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,000
we can do with the ASIC machines later on
down the line, figure something out.

268
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,000
But yeah, yeah, the hashrate there with
ASICs is humongous, it was like some crazy

269
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
number.

270
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Before I found out that about like 90% of
those machines were ASIC machines, I was

271
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,000
looking at this, I'm like, holy crap,
like, these guys are gonna be making a

272
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
killing.

273
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Do they have hydro in Argentina I believe
a lot of hydro they're right I mean I'm

274
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:50,000
sure they do you know one thing about
Argentina and I guess that was kind of

275
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:55,000
like me well I mean it's like no duh but
you just don't really realize it how big

276
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:00,000
it is until you get there and it's huge
you know Argentina is a damn large

277
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,000
country.

278
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,000
And so you get all sorts of climates out
there.

279
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:18,000
You have Buenos Aires, which is actually
a lot like Los Angeles, climate-wise.

280
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Really sunny a lot of times.

281
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
The weather is really good.

282
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:30,000
But then you go to other regions, and it
could get really hot or really cold,

283
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:36,000
because the South is so close to the South
Pole, that there's a lot of places that

284
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:42,000
are snow on the ground all year long,
mostly.

285
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:48,000
But yeah, there are places with
hydroelectric.

286
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:56,000
There's also places with hydroelectric, I
believe, in Paraguay.

287
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,000
So there's quite a bit of opportunity
there.

288
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Plus, they're also really into
sustainable power generation, so low

289
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:14,000
carbon footprint stuff, carbon credits,
and so they have all these other means

290
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:21,000
like wind and solar.

291
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:27,000
There's solar farms out there because
there's a lot of sun.

292
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
in Argentina.

293
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:33,000
I mean, there's really large patches of
desert.

294
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Like Catamarca, Catamarca is, a lot of it
is desert.

295
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Like a lot of it is like, I would say
Eastern California going into Nevada,

296
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Arizona and Nevada, it really reminds you
of that.

297
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:56,000
There's high elevations too that are not
as hot, but a lot like where we were in

298
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Catamarca and then in Jujuy and Salta,
that was just straight desert, no doubt

299
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:06,000
about it.

300
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
It was high desert, but it was desert.

301
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:16,000
And so there's a lot of solar farms out
there.

302
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,000
And obviously wind, there's quite a bit
of wind over there.

303
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
So yeah, a lot of opportunities, I think,
and I think they're really hungry for new

304
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
opportunities out there.

305
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,000
That whole economy is just really booming
right now.

306
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,000
There's a lot of people kind of waking up
and saying, hey, we got all these things

307
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,000
that we can offer to the world and all
these things that the world can offer to

308
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,000
us.

309
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
And let's see what we can do.

310
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,000
So, so yeah, very exciting, good stuff.

311
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
And a lot of opportunity for Ergo.

312
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Oh, we got, we got Jume.

313
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
I think he used to work for the CIA.

314
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
I'm not sure.

315
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Yeah, this guy, I don't know about this
guy.

316
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Anyway, let's get into some questions.

317
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
We don't have a huge amount of people
here, but we do have some really good

318
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
questions.

319
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
So let's go to Augustus Kent here.

320
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
So block rewards reduced to 18.

321
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,000
What effect does it have on the hash rate
and sell pressure?

322
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
So what do you think, kushti?

323
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:33,000
All right, so around the past weekend,
well, emission dropped to 18 per block

324
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:39,000
from 21.

325
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,000
And we are going to have a party in
coming days.

326
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:49,000
It was proposed by Chris Ray because,
yeah, for him, it's kind of a

327
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:55,000
psychologically important level, right, I
mean, to have emission falling below 20

328
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:01,000
and well if it's important for him then
why not to have party I mean it sounds

329
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:07,000
like a good reason to have party after all
right if it makes at least some community

330
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:13,000
members happy then why not.

331
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:23,000
So yeah we will have a party in coming
days in form of I don't know maybe Twitter

332
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:32,000
spaces or zoom call so please join maybe
with your favorite beverage like carrot

333
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:41,000
juice I don't know maybe tea with lemon
something like that so

334
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Yeah, then, sorry, what was the question
about?

335
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,000
It wasn't a pear juice, but yeah.

336
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Yeah, so it's wonderful.

337
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
It's wonderful.

338
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Yeah, refreshing and healthy beverage.

339
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Yeah, also helping to have parties, for
funny parties after all.

340
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
All right, so the question about the hash
rate.

341
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Actually, well, the hash rate was quite
stable, even increasing, because there was

342
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:23,000
a price increase around the same day.

343
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:30,000
So, yeah, it was very okay, the
transition to lower emission.

344
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Then, yeah, the question is also about
sell pressure, right?

345
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:43,000
So, well, effects are not visible.

346
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:52,000
maybe about this particular drop in
emission but yeah I think overall so you

347
00:30:52,000 --> 00:31:01,000
know like three years ago we had 67.5 ERG
per block going to miners and now just 18

348
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:10,000
and well yeah well effects are quite
visible if you are tracking deposits to

349
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:19,000
exchanges right so well it's now
definitely much much more rare event,

350
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:28,000
right, when you see like, I don't know,
50k ERG transfer to centralized exchange,

351
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:37,000
right, from a miner address.

352
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,000
So three years ago that happened like
daily, right, because the emission was

353
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
about 50k a day.

354
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:56,000
So now well, there were a lot of small
deposits, but for big miners there were

355
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:03,000
big deposits happening regularly.

356
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,000
So now, well, the emission is just about
13k a day and definitely much less

357
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,000
deposits.

358
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:24,000
And so if you if you visit ergo.watch
website, then a chart which is about total

359
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:37,000
amount of deposit addresses.

360
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
on centralized exchanges.

361
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:51,000
So, you see that currently, well, number
there is about early minimum value, right?

362
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,000
So, well, emission is going on, but yeah,
well, more ERG actually extracted from

363
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,000
centralized exchanges.

364
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:05,000
So, then, yeah, well, definitely, there
is a factor of reduced emission, so that's

365
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:10,000
quite visible.

366
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Well, centralized exchanges' balances are
going down and reaching minimum values,

367
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:31,000
breaking early lows.

368
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Well, week after week, basically.

369
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Which is quite exciting because, well,
centralized exchanges are not good, right,

370
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:49,000
and, well, if miners are using them, then,
yeah, well, reduced emission is helping to

371
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:56,000
extract, right, ERG from centralized
exchanges, because, well, having millions

372
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:03,000
in centralized exchanges is creating
certain risks, right, for possible

373
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:10,000
redistribution of ERG towards hackers and
so on because, well, centralized exchanges

374
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:17,000
are being hacked regularly, right, or
being shut down or whatever, so yeah,

375
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:24,000
folks better to avoid holding on
centralized exchanges.

376
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:30,000
So yeah, better to pull your ERG out of
centralized exchanges.

377
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:37,000
So yeah, well, in short, effects are
visible for emission reduction and well,

378
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:44,000
hash rate is doing well.

379
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
All right.

380
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
All right.

381
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
We actually got another one here.

382
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Let's see from Alex C. So any plans to
update the SigmaUSD protocol to mitigate

383
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:57,000
future bear whale attacks?

384
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Yeah, so there are discussions happening
in the developers' community.

385
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:14,000
There are five update key holders, so it
depends on the decision.

386
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:22,000
There are some proposals.

387
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:31,000
about introducing limits just for minting
both SigmaUSD and SigmaRSV.

388
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:39,000
There is probably better but also more
complicated and still not formalized

389
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:47,000
proposal about introducing dynamic fee
rights then making SigmaUSD closer to

390
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Dynamic Djed, right, Gluon to some extent.

391
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:03,000
So yeah, well, I joined Ergo developers
group and SigmaUSD group.

392
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:10,000
So for some reason, talks while migrating
from one group to another and then back.

393
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:23,000
So yeah, well, it's better to follow both
groups to follow all the discussions.

394
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Yeah, then next question.

395
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:31,000
What is the feasibility of a private
blockchain messaging on Ergo?

396
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,000
So, yeah, that's possible.

397
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:48,000
And there is, I believe, I reviewed once
an EIP draft about that, so how to get

398
00:36:48,000 --> 00:37:01,000
shared secret key from, well, your key and
just public key of another party.

399
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Right, and then how to derive encryption
key from that, and then how to encrypt

400
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,000
messages.

401
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:17,000
So, yeah, I forgot an EIP number, but you
can find it.

402
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Well, about concrete implementations, I
don't know.

403
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Well, maybe there was some implementation
done, or some hackathon, but I'm not sure

404
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:37,000
about that.

405
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Oh, next question to Dan, finally.

406
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:47,000
I'm talking too much probably.

407
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Dan, you're muted.

408
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,000
I'm not muted, I'm speaking to you
telepathically.

409
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:59,000
This is common knowledge.

410
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Fine, I was muted.

411
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Well, actually I wasn't, but I'm trying
to make you feel better.

412
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Let's see, yeah, finally one for me,
although I think I like questions for

413
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:16,000
kushti more because it's much more fun
listening to him explain.

414
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
All right.

415
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
How many languages do you speak?

416
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Which one do you speak most eloquently?

417
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
So let's see.

418
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
I speak fluently.

419
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:30,000
I speak Russian, English, and Japanese.

420
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:35,000
I speak Ukrainian or used to speak
Ukrainian.

421
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:41,000
But I'm really rusty, because I just
don't have anybody to speak Ukrainian to.

422
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
But it's like one of those things.

423
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,000
It's like riding a bicycle.

424
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Anytime I'm in that environment, it comes
back.

425
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,000
But again, it goes away again.

426
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
So it's a weird thing.

427
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:03,000
But mainly, those three and a half.

428
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Ukrainian if I had more if I had more
opportunity to just speak it would be four

429
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:19,000
But yeah, the ones that I use every day is
three English Russian and and the Japanese

430
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Which one am I most eloquent in I Mean it
depends

431
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:41,000
I guess equally English and Russian, I
would say it's about the same.

432
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:46,000
I can be eloquent in Japanese, but
sometimes I have my brain farts and then I

433
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:51,000
say something and it just sounds kind of
dumb.

434
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
And then I later on, I think about it and
I say, what the hell?

435
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Wait a second.

436
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
I know how to say that.

437
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Like, why did I say it like that?

438
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
I know how to say this stuff, right?

439
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:06,000
So it's a never ending battle to not
sound stupid.

440
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Yeah.

441
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:13,000
So I think that takes care of that
question.

442
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Alright, let's...

443
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Okay.

444
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Well, let's take this question.

445
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
I know we get these, but let's maybe
address it.

446
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:25,000
So yeah, Nabil's right.

447
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Yeah.

448
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Yeah.

449
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,000
So, what do you think about the current
marketing efforts in the community?

450
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,000
And would you have any suggestions for
improvement?

451
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Okay.

452
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
So, I mean, again, what has been, I
actually, this would be a really good qx()

453
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
question.

454
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Unfortunately, he's not here because
there's something about him and I don't

455
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
know.

456
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
He caught Ebola or something.

457
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
I don't know what the hell is wrong with
that guy.

458
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000
But anyway, yeah.

459
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
So what's been going on with marketing,
kushti?

460
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Have we had any kind of new marketing
pushes or what's been happening?

461
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Yeah, so about suggestions for
improvements.

462
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:14,000
I actually can talk a lot about
suggestions for improvements.

463
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:24,000
But then we had a community town hall
call on marketing back in November.

464
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,000
I guess, yeah, it was November probably.

465
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:36,000
And then, yeah, well, I tried to suggest
some things, but, yeah, it seems, well, a

466
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:44,000
lot of other people also have a lot of
suggestions and then, yeah, well.

467
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:53,000
quickly I've got lost in the talk so it
was about one hour and a half so well it

468
00:41:53,000 --> 00:42:02,000
changed well topics and well a lot of
things were discussed and so on so yeah

469
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:11,000
that's how well things should be maybe
right if we are talking about well

470
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:20,000
community which is not controlled by a
certain party right which is well

471
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:29,000
decentralized so well you may have a lot
of suggestions right the question is who

472
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:38,000
is going to hear them right and consider

473
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Still, I think there is need to improve
some things.

474
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:56,000
I am working on some improvements
personally.

475
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:01,000
My main focus at the moment is about,
well, promoting Ergo from a developer's

476
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:06,000
perspective to developers right.

477
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:16,000
So as we are now having some positive,
well, pricing right and, well, some buzzes

478
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:25,000
going around.

479
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Time to get more developers and well if
some people in the community are talking

480
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:41,000
about well very strange kind of talk so
which fiat price is possible for ERG token

481
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:49,000
rights

482
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Which is, I don't know, quite strange to
me because any fiat number is just a

483
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,000
mental trap, I guess, right?

484
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:05,000
So I mean, you can call any number and it
will be reached at some point, but what's

485
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:11,000
the point in any concrete number even?

486
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,000
That's quite strange to me at least.

487
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:23,000
But yeah, so what I'm thinking about is
how to get 10x developers right in 2025

488
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:31,000
for core and ecosystem development.

489
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:43,000
That would be much more solid right so
talking about well recognition and so on

490
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:54,000
and then so what's needed I think is some
strong messaging right so I'm looking at

491
00:44:54,000 --> 00:45:05,000
some successful communities around, such
as Bitcoin to some degree, and now Monero.

492
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:14,000
So what they are good at is about sending
strong messaging about pushing the memetic

493
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:23,000
warfare around, so that they're filling
Twitter now acts with memes that they're

494
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:32,000
filling other social networks that they
have.

495
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Well, strong supporters about pretty
simple and powerful messages, right?

496
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Well, Bitcoin maybe not so much these
days, but yet 10 years ago it was the

497
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
case.

498
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Bitcoin was very strong memetically.

499
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:57,000
That's why people did stick with it, like
me, right?

500
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Because, well, their community was pretty
small back then.

501
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Actually, it was quite strong, right, in
their messaging.

502
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:13,000
The same, well, I see now.

503
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:22,000
to a certain degree in Monero community
and well I think how to achieve the same

504
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:31,000
right and I'm pushing people around well
about achieving the same so about well

505
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:40,000
forming some strong messaging and creating
memetic warfare and spread it around.

506
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:45,000
It could be on different levels, so you
can attract developers.

507
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:53,000
with a certain kind of, well, memetic
push even, right?

508
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:58,000
And then, yeah, well, just ordinary users
like, I don't know, traders, enthusiasts,

509
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:03,000
hackers, and so on.

510
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:10,000
There are different audiences, right,
with different requests.

511
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:16,000
the different needs, new needs for
messaging, including.

512
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:27,000
And yeah, well, we have already some
brilliant people.

513
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:33,000
messages around, like Demurrage Louise,
for example.

514
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:38,000
I'm trying to do some things, but we need
some more, right?

515
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:46,000
So, well, unlike privacy coins, Ergo,
maybe it's quite complex, right?

516
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Like, well, financial and monetary
systems are, well, very complex as well,

517
00:47:54,000 --> 00:48:02,000
but you can just, well, push some aspects
of it, right?

518
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:07,000
So like Demurrage Louise is pushing
demurrage narrative to Bitcoiners and so

519
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:11,000
on.

520
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Because Ergo is quite unique here.

521
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Joy is pushing quite successfully
peer-to-peer finance.

522
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
narrative and so on.

523
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:29,000
So, well, there are many levels here,
right?

524
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:33,000
And many, many angles.

525
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:42,000
You can take a look at Ergo tech and not
just tech ads.

526
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,000
So, yeah, those are my thoughts.

527
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:52,000
So, what do you think about the question?

528
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:59,000
You have mutes again.

529
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:04,000
It's only 15 clicks to unmute myself,
sorry.

530
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:09,000
I mean, I think that, and what's
actually, this is actually, there's

531
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:14,000
actually really good comment from Wendy
Moon on this.

532
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,000
And so this is actually the very bottom,
sorry guys, I'm gonna go to the very

533
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,000
bottom of the comments here.

534
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:26,000
She says, when it comes to strong
messaging, Bitcoin has a simple message,

535
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:31,000
digital gold, money, Monero is privacy,
but Ergo has more complicated message

536
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:36,000
because it can do so many things.

537
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:40,000
How do we convey Ergo's message?

538
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:49,000
I kind of thought about that quite a bit.

539
00:49:49,000 --> 00:50:01,000
And this kind of has to be improved.

540
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:07,000
But to me, Bitcoin is digital gold.

541
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Ergo is digital clay.

542
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:13,000
That's what it is to me.

543
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:18,000
You can, it's ready to create and mold so
many different things and you can make it

544
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:23,000
in so many different shapes and things
that to me is digital clay.

545
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:30,000
And I know that might not be the best
kind of marketing phrase, might want to

546
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:36,000
come up with something a little bit more
eloquent or a little bit more.

547
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
I don't know.

548
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:43,000
I don't know a little something that
something that sounds a little bit more.

549
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:49,000
But just like I said to me, it's digital
clay because it's Bitcoin, it's Monero,

550
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:55,000
it's all these things put together.

551
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:00,000
And it's our thing has always been Ergo
was launched ready to go right out of the

552
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,000
box.

553
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:09,000
We had all these different things that
other blockchains took time to deploy.

554
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:14,000
They already deployed on Ergo from the
get-go.

555
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Just like clay.

556
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:19,000
You can take a piece of clay and build a
house with it.

557
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:26,000
You can take a piece of clay and build a
pot out of it.

558
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,000
It's so versatile.

559
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:36,000
And that's really the message of Ergo to
me is versatility.

560
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:42,000
And I think that we are the community
kind of what you were talking about, the

561
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:48,000
what some call tyranny of the majority or
herding cats, which is basically

562
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:54,000
centralization, trying to come up with any
kind of unified decision and decentralized

563
00:51:54,000 --> 00:52:00,000
communities like herding cats.

564
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:07,000
But from that also comes a very, really
clear diversity message.

565
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:14,000
So that thing that I said where it's so,
there's so much that can be built in it.

566
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,000
That's why there's all these voices here.

567
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:19,000
It's not just one voice for this one
thing that everybody's obsessed over like

568
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:23,000
TVL or something.

569
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:28,000
or I don't know something else that the
other guys are all obsessed about

570
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:33,000
transactions on chain that's all they care
about Solana's like all Solana made a

571
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:38,000
gazillion transactions on chain who gives
a shit did the garbage

572
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:46,000
It's the most disgusting messages from
the messaging probably, right?

573
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Well, that's the thing, and but that is
really the narrative of today's blockchain

574
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,000
field.

575
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Unfortunately, at least, the popular the
popular kids, that's what they keep

576
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:02,000
talking about.

577
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,000
And I see this stuff, like the Solana
Foundation out there was, I think we were

578
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:08,000
just talking about that, right?

579
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Just a little bit ago about how, like
Solana has crossed Ethereum in

580
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:21,000
transactional volumes.

581
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,000
Like, okay, who gives a crap?

582
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,000
A bunch of those transactions fail.

583
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:28,000
most of them are bots, and they're shit
to begin with.

584
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,000
And it's just like, okay?

585
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:35,000
It's, I mean, like, just because a city
is filled with people doesn't mean it's a

586
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:39,000
good city.

587
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:45,000
So, yeah, it's, with Ergo, it's
definitely different.

588
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:50,000
With Ergo, Ergo attracts a different type
of contingent.

589
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:59,000
And so this is why, like I said, the
message is this, a message of versatility.

590
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
And I think that's what's gonna work for
us.

591
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:05,000
It's a longer, it's a tougher message to
get across.

592
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:10,000
But I think that in the end, it will be a
message that works for us.

593
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,000
I mean, that's what my thoughts are.

594
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:18,000
And so for Bitcoin, there were many
messages, actually.

595
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:23,000
So digital gold, maybe not the first one,
historically.

596
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:27,000
So I've heard about magic internet money,
right?

597
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:32,000
So that was back in 2011, 2012, something
like that.

598
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Then, yeah, well, money without central
bank, that's what I bought.

599
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:44,000
So to me, it was mind-blowing to have
money with emission not dependent on any

600
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:49,000
trusted party.

601
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Somehow, this is not surprising people
these days.

602
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:07,000
This is, I don't know, quite like a
normal thing, but back in 2011, that was

603
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:16,000
quite revolutionary to me to have emission
without any trusted party for real.

604
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:23,000
So we don't have any illusion here.

605
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:30,000
without any trusted party which is not so
quite visible so maybe influential or

606
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:37,000
maybe replaced with federation or whatever
so no just no trusted party at all right

607
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:44,000
and algorithmic emission you have and you
have working kind of monetary system

608
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:51,000
around that then yeah digital gold

609
00:55:52,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Then, yeah, there was a push about, I'm
not sure about timing, about, yeah, just

610
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:08,000
21 million, right, so usually it works
well during high inflation period for fiat

611
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:16,000
currencies.

612
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Yeah, and for Ergo, we also have a lot of
messaging rights, like Demurrage Louise is

613
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:26,000
pushing for money with fixed supply.

614
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:30,000
The only one kind of money with fixed
supply, unlike Bitcoin, which supply is

615
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,000
going to zero.

616
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:51,000
My initial presentations back in 2019
were about digital gold with contracts.

617
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Right, so when you have digital gold but
also with possibility to have contracts or

618
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:07,000
to build trustless derivatives and so on,
so to have a high-level money systems.

619
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:15,000
Then yeah, a platform for money right for
monetary systems maybe it's quite complex

620
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:22,000
but yeah also working for some people then
yeah i mean a platform for peer-to-peer

621
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:29,000
finance platform for peer-to-peer
financial interactions and so on so well

622
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:36,000
there are different messages here right
and when you know some blockchain is if

623
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:43,000
the community is just saying I don't know
we are web 3 layer 1 project with

624
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:50,000
bazillion TPS I mean

625
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
This is just nothing, right?

626
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:58,000
I mean, you guys are just, I don't know,
trumping the air with unnecessary words,

627
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:03,000
right?

628
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:06,000
They're not telling anything, really.

629
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
It's smoke and mirrors, that's all it is.

630
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:14,000
It's smoke and mirrors, it's just, it's
things that people that are perceived as

631
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:20,000
smart because they're smarter than other
people, they're just kind of hijacking

632
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:26,000
this narrative and the narrative itself is
really dumb.

633
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:32,000
But because some people are just too
intimidated by, oh, this guy's so-and-so,

634
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:37,000
he did so-and-so, they buy into this shit.

635
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:40,000
And then in the end, I mean, in the end,
it does nothing.

636
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:43,000
In the end, it's moot.

637
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:47,000
And you are right, the messaging does
change.

638
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
It's not always the same messaging.

639
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
It's not always the same thing that is
being said.

640
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
And it changes throughout the years.

641
00:58:53,000 --> 00:59:01,000
And so, like I said, it is...

642
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:07,000
Look, like I said, it's all about the
versatility of the ecosystem, and that is

643
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:13,000
our strongest suit.

644
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:17,000
However we choose to describe that, to
me, is digital clay.

645
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:26,000
To others, it's Bitcoin with contracts,
digital gold with contracts.

646
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
It doesn't have to be all the same.

647
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:32,000
It can be several different ones and it
can be targeted for different groups.

648
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:35,000
But one thing is certain is that the
versatility is our strong point of

649
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:38,000
versatility is what we should be pushing.

650
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,000
All right.

651
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Yeah, I think it's about a good time to
wrap it up.

652
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:49,000
And oh, here's a nice message from White
Cat.

653
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,000
So thank you.

654
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,000
Thank you, White Cat.

655
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
It's great to be back.

656
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:56,000
And yeah, thank you for watching the
documentary.

657
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Part two is coming.

658
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Part two is going to be we're going to be
filming that when we go back to Argentina.

659
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:08,000
And this is also one of the reasons why
it's so important for us to start working.

660
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:15,000
And we are working on the lithium index
and all of this.

661
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:19,000
all this stuff, because when we go back
to Argentina in late March, early April,

662
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:23,000
we're actually going, we're already going
to deploy this so that we can then expand

663
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:27,000
on our efforts for that sustainable
lithium mining, because we're going to

664
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:31,000
have this index, most likely going to have
the stable coin launched, we're going to

665
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:35,000
have different projects coming on in
endeavor to utilize the STO and the ETO

666
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:39,000
platform.

667
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Gonna have other projects utilizing
Palmyra Pro, so it's gonna be very

668
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:49,000
exciting and it's gonna be really cool to
be able to go back there and to really

669
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:53,000
continue the work because it is super
exciting and you're making a difference.

670
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:58,000
You just see that you're making a
difference.

671
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
Anyway, guys, thanks a lot.

672
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:05,000
I will do all I can to be and go ahead.

673
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:09,000
Then maybe last question for you.

674
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
Do we have one minute?

675
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
So it's from FC.

676
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:17,000
Then when token launch for Palm, how much
has been raised from a stake pool, funding

677
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:21,000
crowns, grants, etc.

678
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:27,000
How many miles you racked up in 2024.

679
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
So three questions, so you may cut me.

680
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Right, right, right.

681
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:38,000
So the Palm Token launch, so it's coming
up really soon.

682
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:43,000
In fact, we're actually going to drop the
dates, I think, later on.

683
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:46,000
Well, I guess it's whoever you are in the
world.

684
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:51,000
In the next few hours, we're actually
going to drop the dates for TGE.

685
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:56,000
And so that's coming up real soon.

686
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:00,000
So just watch out for that on Palm
economy.

687
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,000
But like I said, I'd love to say right
now, but I'm going to mess up our entire

688
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:06,000
marketing comms.

689
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:10,000
And they're going to be really pissed off
at me if I just drop it right now.

690
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:13,000
So I'll give them the chance to do their
jobs, wait a few hours.

691
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,000
It's going to be announced.

692
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,000
But it's very soon.

693
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:20,000
We're basically kind of like the finish
line right now.

694
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:24,000
There's a lot of stuff in the pipeline.

695
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:27,000
We got the centralized exchanges,
although we don't like them much, but we

696
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:30,000
have to work with them.

697
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
We got some nice ones for people to trade
on.

698
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:36,000
We got also DEXs that we are going to be
launching on.

699
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:40,000
There's going to be liquidity that we're
going to be providing for this.

700
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
So there's going to be quite a lot of
action.

701
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
for the Palm Token.

702
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
Staking is going to go live soon.

703
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:51,000
There's going to be a new product that I
was talking about that's going to be

704
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:56,000
utilizing Palm that is going to also
utilize a lot of traceability, that is

705
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:01,000
going to also be a big value add for the
Palm Holders.

706
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:06,000
So how much has been raised?

707
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:13,000
So through everything, I believe it was I
have to look at the numbers, but I believe

708
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:20,000
it was somewhere in the neighborhood of,
1.5 million ADA, I believe, because we had

709
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:27,000
several different rounds.

710
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:32,000
But yeah, altogether, I think it's about
1.5.

711
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:36,000
And yeah, and so there's gonna be one
last tranche for the public sale that

712
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:40,000
we're gonna be doing right now.

713
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:44,000
This is gonna be part of the announcement
as well.

714
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:48,000
That's gonna be happening in a few hours.

715
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:51,000
Yeah, and so that will lead us into TGE.

716
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:55,000
And so yeah, TGE is happening, whether
you like it or not.

717
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
It's happening real soon.

718
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,000
It's happening.

719
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:03,000
Well, you'll know when it's happening,
but it's all lined up.

720
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
So just like I said, just wait for that
announcement and I think you'll be very

721
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
happy.

722
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:12,000
And again, thank you for hanging with us,
it hasn't been easy going getting through

723
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:17,000
the bear market right now.

724
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:23,000
One of the main reasons we kind of made
sure that we launch in the right time is

725
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:28,000
because, like I said on our discord, I
just.

726
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:32,000
could not, it would be irresponsible for
me to launch into the depths of the bear

727
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:36,000
market.

728
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:41,000
And I think that the Palm holders
appreciate that.

729
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:44,000
And I think they will appreciate it even
more because, but once we actually pulled

730
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:47,000
the trigger and a lot of these things that
are ready to go.

731
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
So yeah.

732
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:55,000
I'm really happy that we are doing it now
and that we have a lot more opportunity

733
01:04:55,000 --> 01:05:00,000
for everybody to have a really, really
happy TGE.

734
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:06,000
And how many miles have you racked up in
2024?

735
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:12,000
So, okay, so I have been racking up a lot
of Emirates miles.

736
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:17,000
But the problem is that only six months
ago that I discovered that I could

737
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:22,000
actually earn Emirates, because Emirates
are the most difficult miles to get.

738
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:28,000
But I was able to understand that there's
actually a way to get Emirates miles from

739
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:33,000
like booking hotels and stuff.

740
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:36,000
If you go through booking.com, you can
actually earn Emirates miles if you go

741
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:39,000
through their app.

742
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:43,000
So I just started earning like a lot of
Emirates miles.

743
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:48,000
So you would think I have a lot, but
they're all scattered all over the place.

744
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:51,000
Yeah.

745
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:53,000
I got KLM, I got Emirates, I got
Argentinian Airlines, I got like everybody

746
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:58,000
in Air Canada, but they're all just like
little by little by little.

747
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:02,000
I got Alaska Airlines.

748
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:05,000
So now the mission for this year is to
have like one unified place where I have

749
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:08,000
my miles.

750
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:12,000
It's most likely going to be my Emirates
miles.

751
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:15,000
And yeah, we're going to finally going to
be able to, I'm going to finally going to

752
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:18,000
be able to utilize that for if I take 50
flights, I'll probably be able to get an

753
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:21,000
ice cream or something.

754
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
Anyway, all right, guys.

755
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:28,000
Well, I think this is a good place to
leave it off for this week.

756
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:34,000
Thanks for all the questions and thanks
for all of your for all your input for

757
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:40,000
participating because that's what it's all
about.

758
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
All right, and so yeah, thanks for
joining kushti.

759
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:47,000
Like I said, I will be at many more of
these this year.

760
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:50,000
I will make sure that I make the time.

761
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:53,000
And yeah, and so until then, so I guess
what?

762
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:59,000
Next week, same place, same channel,
possibly slightly different time?

763
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:00,000
Possibly?

764
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:03,000
I don't know.

765
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
We'll see.

766
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,000
Because it is kind of late for me.

767
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:06,000
It's already 12, 10 a.m.

768
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:11,000
So yeah, hopefully we can do it a little
earlier next time.

769
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:14,000
But anyway, guys, thanks a lot.

770
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:21,000
And yeah, this is Dan coming to you
Barely Alive from Japan, but still

771
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:28,000
kicking, signing off.

772
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:31,000
Everyone.
