00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Hi everybody. Welcome to the, what do we
call it, kushti, we're calling it the Ergo

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
ecosystem weekly AMA?

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Yeah, so I had some discussions with
folks, well, Sigmanauts we had in Hong

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Kong, our consensus Hong Kong event, and
yeah, well, it seems, you know, like Ergo

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:50,000
AMA does sound quite strange, I mean,
considering that I mean, it's a protocol,

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:58,000
right, and the assets are not controlled.
And, well, there is no any party, right,

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:06,000
which can represent itself as Ergo, then
the question is what does Ergo mean. So,

9
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:14,000
well, Ergo ecosystem is then quite better,
right, in this regard. Just a word game,

10
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:22,000
maybe. But yeah, well, there is such
feedback.

11
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
All right. That sounds good to me. We put
it on the poster this week. We'll see how

12
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
it flies. But it does make sense. There's
no. Right. I mean, we have the EF as the

13
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
official Ergo Foundation entity, but from
there it's all ecosystem people that

14
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
broadcast here and do this. You're not
part of the EF. I'm not part of the EF.

15
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Dan, I think still an advisor, but yeah.

16
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,000
And also it's not official entities. So,
I mean, it was established not to control

17
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
the protocol, right? So, well, it's vision
document which I composed with the help of

18
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
MX, I believe, and some other folks back
in 2019. So, yeah, it's not saying that

19
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,000
this entity is, well, controlling the
protocol and this entity is official. I

20
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,000
mean, there is no such word everywhere. At
least we didn't make it because, I mean,

21
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
it's also quite confusing. I mean, what
does it mean, official?

22
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:34,000
So, what's... I mean, when you're talking
about something official, that does mean

23
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:42,000
some compliance and, well, responsibility,
right, and then control, but, yeah, well,

24
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I don't think Ergo Foundation has control
to start with, and then, yeah, it doesn't

25
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:58,000
make sense to tell about other things such
as responsibility and compliance and so

26
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:06,000
on. It was designed this way. It was never
considered as official, at least when it

27
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:14,000
was established.

28
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:26,000
At some point I also removed the words
official repository, because it's the same

29
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:33,000
problem. What does it mean, official code
repository? The term is not quite clear.

30
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:40,000
And also, you know, the problem is that in
Git, you can fork the code. And there are

31
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:47,000
like tens, maybe hundreds of forks of Ergo
repository over GitHub. And you can find

32
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:54,000
words official repository in those 100
repositories around GitHub. And that

33
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:01,000
doesn't make any sense. So, well, this
should be attributed outside, but then,

34
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:08,000
yeah, it's the same question. I mean, what
makes this repository official? What does

35
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:15,000
the term mean even?

36
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
What'd you rename the GitHub to? Did you
have DAO in there at all? Like the

37
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
ergo-dev-dao-github repository for that
stuff?

38
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:33,000
No, no, so it's ergo-platform, but yeah,
well, the repository is just... So it

39
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:41,000
wasn't the node code repository, so it's
now just saying what it is, right? So,

40
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:49,000
well, it's the node code, well, yeah, so,
well, it's the initial implementation,

41
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:57,000
right, so, well, to be considered as a
reference for further implementations,

42
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:05,000
like Sigma Rust, for example, is
following, well, the Sigma SDK

43
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:13,000
implementation, right, of ErgoTree and
ErgoScript, but well, this reference

44
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:21,000
nature is not making anything official. I
mean, I don't even understand such term

45
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:29,000
here to start with. Or does it mean
official? And who can give such status to

46
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:37,000
some codes? Right, well, no any
jurisdiction or whatever considered right.

47
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:45,000
So it's misleading. It's confusing and
does not make any sense.

48
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
No, and it also doesn't lend a hand to
resilience necessarily. If you have

49
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
official things, official things can be
taken down and pulled away, and that

50
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
doesn't look good for a project
necessarily. So if it's not representing

51
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
an open source peer-to-peer project like
Ergo properly, then there's no reason to

52
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
have it there, especially because of that
kind of exposure. So without those kind of

53
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
self-proclaimed official entities, you
have a bit more resilience to the

54
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
protocol, I think.

55
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Yeah and so what's also discussed in Hong
Kong and tell us about Hong Kong kushti

56
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:35,000
tell us about Hong Kong yeah so we heard
well like hundreds of conversations with

57
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:43,000
different entities and people around. And,
well, also talks with Sigmanauts. Well,

58
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:51,000
what we have currently in the ecosystem,
right, is, well, a variety of players or

59
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:59,000
commercial players established such as
Zengate right we had a lot of

60
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:07,000
conversations with Sam Zengate still then
yeah not legally established anywhere to

61
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:15,000
the best of my knowledge but still doing
some commercial activity such as Rosen for

62
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:23,000
example right so.

63
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Then, yes, some non-profit organizations,
community organizations, established

64
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:39,000
nodes, such as Sigmanauts, Ergo
Foundation, Ergo Devs DAO, and so on,

65
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:46,000
right? So, well, it's now maybe... Well,
the best representation of this core,

66
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:53,000
right, could be some kind of informal
alliance, right, and then there is

67
00:07:53,000 --> 00:08:00,000
actually some marketing group, well,
existing, just to think, such as

68
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Sigmanauts, right, some private groups,
but it actually has a lot of people from

69
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:14,000
community, like 60 or 70.

70
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:26,000
So then, yeah, well, the idea, which I
still need to write down there, actually,

71
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:35,000
because, well, spending a lot of times
after the trip, well, finishing

72
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:44,000
conversations, resolving different issues
and so on. So, well, the idea is to get us

73
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:53,000
in sync right there. And then, yeah, well,
try to represent Ergo collectively, right?

74
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Well, there are different representations
of protocols we have. Well, the core

75
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:11,000
protocol, right? And then, yeah, well,
some protocols on top of such as oracles

76
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:20,000
and so on right and infrastructure and
yeah that's totally perfect right to have

77
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:29,000
different views but then yeah well the
idea is to get in sync and represent Ergo

78
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:38,000
well as somewhat well some common grounds
which is shared, right, for different

79
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:47,000
builders of peer-to-peer everything kind
of future.

80
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:58,000
And then, yeah, well, there are different
users, right, for those entities. So for

81
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Zengate, it's, well, mostly about B2B,
probably, right, relationships. For

82
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:16,000
MewFinance, it's, yeah, very informal kind
of relationship right and the same for

83
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Rosen and so on but to say that it is B2C
even right if it's about again some

84
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:34,000
protocol as in case of Rosen run by like
hundreds of people right so then yeah it's

85
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:43,000
it's kind of I don't know like mostly like
digital corporation which is run by well

86
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:52,000
broad base of shareholders something like
that right.

87
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:03,000
How did that work for Bitcoin back in the
day, kushti, since you were around? How

88
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:09,000
did some kind of... Yeah, I guess so.

89
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:17,000
There were different efforts, right? So
initially it was like Bitcoin talk, right?

90
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:25,000
And well, I haven't been around back in
2010. But, yeah, from reading the forum

91
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:33,000
after, it seems it was like, I don't know,
just a bunch of enthusiasts trying to push

92
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Bitcoin as unstoppable money, well,
launching different initiatives,

93
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:49,000
initiatives such as, well, helping
WikiLeaks, for example, right, when it was

94
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:57,000
cut by established financial institutions.
So, well, it was maybe the first, well,

95
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:05,000
marketing campaign, big marketing campaign
for Bitcoin back in 2010, right? And,

96
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:13,000
well, there are opinions that, yes,
Satoshi disappeared after, probably,

97
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:21,000
because he thinks started to be quite
serious, right? It was not just a small

98
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:29,000
peer-to-peer effort, a peer-to-peer system
from enthusiasts, right? Well, starting

99
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:37,000
with Wikileaks campaign.

100
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:44,000
But then, yeah, there was attempt to do a
Bitcoin foundation, right well with

101
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:51,000
basically the same mission I believe right
as Ergo Foundation so yeah well I guess

102
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Ergo Foundation is kind of like third or
fourth iteration of the Bitcoin foundation

103
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:05,000
but then yeah well the foundation seems to
exist and then well what we had after and

104
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:12,000
what do we have now? Well, it was
established especially clear during the

105
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:19,000
block-sized civil war, right? So, well,
there are some commercial organizations

106
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:26,000
starting with Blockstream. So Blockstream
was a commercial company established back

107
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:33,000
in 2015 by like eight co-developers of
Bitcoin with the idea to develop

108
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:40,000
sidechains and then Lightning network as
well. So it's still doing more or less the

109
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:47,000
same, right? Not quite successful, but
Blockstream got successful in mining at

110
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:54,000
least.

111
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:08,000
mining Bitcoin, right, so it's also quite
a big miner. I don't know about these

112
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:16,000
days, but it used to be quite big. A few
years ago when I checked, it had like, I

113
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:24,000
don't know, 16% of total mining hash rate.
So yeah, Blockstream and then some other

114
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:32,000
commercial companies which are, well,
basically sponsoring co-development,

115
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:40,000
right? There are some grants, some
salaries for co-developers, but yeah, by

116
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:48,000
commercial companies. Then there are
miners for sure, big pools and hardware

117
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:56,000
manufacturers right so they're just one
company basically now but yeah back then

118
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:04,000
back in 2010 so back in block size civil
war times there were more right and so

119
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:12,000
well yeah in regards with protocol they
came into some agreements, right? Like

120
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Hong Kong agreements.

121
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Do you think they had not an easier time
per se, you know, because they're forging

122
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,000
the way with Bitcoin? Definitely a
different time, right? Because at no point

123
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,000
did people compare Bitcoin in the early
days to other... There were no other

124
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:46,000
market cap coins to compare it to and say,
why isn't Bitcoin rising as much or why is

125
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Bitcoin falling more than this project
over here? So I feel like while it was

126
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,000
difficult for them to pave that initial
way into cryptocurrency, they didn't have

127
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,000
the same, you know, it's a totally
different world now than it was back then

128
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,000
with other VCs pumps to compare it to and
those kind I mean the number one thing we

129
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,000
see in chats when people try to FUD us is
right. How come this isn't performing like

130
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,000
this or how come this isn't performing
like this? Meanwhile you look in Ergo's

131
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,000
fairly well following Bitcoin or
following, you know other chains as well,

132
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:26,000
but Bitcoin didn't necessarily have that
in the beginning. There wasn't that kind

133
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,000
of FUD, I'd say, that most chains nowadays
are exposed to.

134
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Well, there were no talks about pricing
at all back in 2010, right? Because there

135
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:53,000
were no exchanges. So, I mean, those
talks, yeah, well, certainly did not take

136
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:00,000
place at all about pricing. Yeah, about
competition, I don't know. So, well, I

137
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:07,000
think the biggest competition, the biggest
fear was, you know, the fear of total

138
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:14,000
crackdown and, well, the biggest fear was
and still is fear to go to real world,

139
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:21,000
right? So, and then, yeah, so Bitcoin find
itself in a little bit gray areas, right,

140
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:28,000
and still, well, the whole space is there,
and then, yeah, there is competition,

141
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:35,000
somewhat competition there, but, yeah,
well, competition for liquidity, right,

142
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:42,000
and going into this a little bit gray
zones, but, well, it's still, I think,

143
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:49,000
more or less the same challenges overall,
right.

144
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I mean even, well, if you see like, I
don't know, 1,000 different assets on some

145
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:16,000
centralized exchanges, some centralized
exchange, right, CoinMarketCap, whatever,

146
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:25,000
the question is, well, what's the real
world impact from like, well, any of them

147
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:34,000
right beyond like a few like I don't know
Monero Bitcoin so yeah I think the answer

148
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:43,000
is zero real world impact to those
projects. Yeah, so well, it's just about

149
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:52,000
games in sandbox, but then I mean, it's
quite strange. I mean, discourse, right? I

150
00:18:52,000 --> 00:19:01,000
mean, how successful Ergo is in, well,
games in a sandbox. I think it's one of

151
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:10,000
the things I see. It's strange optics,
right?

152
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Yeah. But the global idea of
cryptocurrencies and blockchains, I still

153
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
see the narrative is still even from
people like Michael Saylor, right? Who's a

154
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
big Bitcoin proponent, right? All I see in
the tidbits of him. I'm sure maybe deep

155
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
down if I watch a video of him explaining
things are going through it There might be

156
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
more but the bottom line is the only
tidbits I see from him on Twitter or the

157
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
news sites or other big influences like
that are that you know, specifically with

158
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Bitcoin, that Bitcoin is digital gold and
Bitcoin is the investment. At no point do

159
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I hear the narrative ever shifted to, you
know, this is a utility and here's how we

160
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
can layer onto this and build more
utility. And here's what we can

161
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
potentially do in the future. So you have
all these voices with pushing this big

162
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
narrative of, here's this investment tool,
here's this digital gold that's

163
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
non-inflationary, that your dollar will be
worth more if you invest in it. So that

164
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
trickles down to everybody. And I'm sure
that's what's contributing to the massive

165
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
speculation on all these pump and dump and
VC investments. I think it's going to be

166
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
hard, but I think the narrative needs to
change to not just here's some

167
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
deflationary currency that you can use.
It's internet magic money, but here's what

168
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
we can do with it. And here's how it can
help people in other countries. Here's

169
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,000
where it can help local shop owners.
Here's where it can help people sick of

170
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
things like eBay or other things. Here's
where we have a digital stable that you

171
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
can put your money into and fight
inflation there. So yeah, I think until

172
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
the, the main narrative changes to
utility, and what it can do, we're still

173
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
going to see a massive, you know, thought
process that cryptocurrencies for

174
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
speculation and for, and for pumping and
earning.

175
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Right. Well, actually, digital gold use
case is not that bad, right? Because,

176
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:22,000
well, it's, well, people need to store
value, right? Especially during turbulent

177
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:30,000
times. Fiat is totally unacceptable for
that. Basically, there is no stable fiat

178
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:38,000
currency. Yeah. So you can buy gold,
right? But it's quite inconvenient, right?

179
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:46,000
In many aspects then. Well, digital gold
is better, right? In many aspects. You can

180
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:54,000
send it.

181
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Easier accessible, easier to store.

182
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Outside, yeah, easily. You can accumulate
it easily. There is no need to, I don't

183
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:08,000
know, build storage, right? Some
underground storage in your backyard,

184
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:14,000
right? And then, I don't know, expand it
when you have more gold and so on. So,

185
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:20,000
yeah, well, it's more convenient, right?
But then, yeah, so if we are talking

186
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:26,000
about, well, not VCs, but even commercial
companies and then central banks and so

187
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:32,000
on, right? They have access to gold,
right? Well, especially central banks.

188
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Well, in some, in actually many
jurisdictions, they monopolized access to

189
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:44,000
gold, even so, gold producers have to sell
gold to central banks in the first place,

190
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:50,000
right?

191
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:04,000
But, well, if they have digital gold,
then, yeah, I think it's quite natural,

192
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:11,000
maybe for commercial companies, actually,
in the first place, to build money on top

193
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:18,000
of rights or to have trustless
derivatives. And here Bitcoin is quite

194
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:25,000
failing and Ergo could be superior, I
believe because you can have trustless

195
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:32,000
derivatives right you can combine
collateral with trustless like ChainCash

196
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:39,000
is doing right so you can have well many
issues for real world needs on top of

197
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:46,000
programmable digital gold which is quite a
different story well especially

198
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:53,000
considering that even if you have Bitcoin
right but well, it's just an asset on your

199
00:23:53,000 --> 00:24:00,000
asset sheet, right? The question is how do
you produce derivatives? Derivative

200
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:07,000
instruments to be used in international
trade, for example, right? Who will trust

201
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:14,000
your asset sheet, right, in like thousands
of kilometers away? in some remote

202
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:21,000
country. So, and well, here is trustless
derivative instruments, quite superior,

203
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:28,000
right?

204
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:45,000
So, yeah, well, had a lot of talks about
that, and yeah, it seems that there is

205
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:53,000
huge demand for that, right? So, and well,
it's it's developing in different ways

206
00:24:53,000 --> 00:25:01,000
around the globe, right? So, well, in the
US, for example, as far as I know, well,

207
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:09,000
there is prohibition for CBDC now, right?
But then there are commercial companies

208
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:17,000
like Tether basically doing free banking,
so issuing dollar, right? minting USD

209
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:25,000
rights according to some corporate
procedures basically. I don't know what

210
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:33,000
kind of oversight they have now but
initially I hate it was there was no

211
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:41,000
oversight, right? Well, it's hard to say
what's going on now, but yeah, probably

212
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:49,000
with relocation to Salvador, right? There
wouldn't be much oversight also, right? So

213
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:57,000
this is basically about going to free
banking, right? The system where, well,

214
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:05,000
money created without oversight from
central bank by private banks, right, so

215
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:13,000
currently money created by private banks
as well, but a tight oversight from

216
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:21,000
central banks talking about reserve system
assets control.

217
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Free banking, there is need for
transparency, right? Especially talking

218
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:51,000
about international trade, right? Global
setting, like this operating case. Yeah,

219
00:26:51,000 --> 00:27:00,000
well, I think programmable gold, again, is
a bit misjudged, right? It's not allowing

220
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:09,000
for derivatives. Yeah, well, at the end of
the day, there were a lot of Bitcoin

221
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:18,000
events about Lightning network and so on.
Well, it's still basically early stage and

222
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:27,000
what's Lightning guys, TAPS companies are
to do now is to get away the initial

223
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:36,000
peer-to-peer, totally peer-to-peer
Lightning design, right? So basically

224
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:45,000
compromising the initial design in the
name of convenience and so on and well the

225
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:54,000
whole Bitcoin DeFi movement I believe is
about getting trustless derivatives but

226
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:03,000
it's going slowly there are certain issues
on the way and so yeah.

227
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,000
How do we wedge in there? How do we you
know, it's got to be from what I my

228
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:18,000
posture on Bitcoin users, maybe just an
axis that I'm exposed to is that you know,

229
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,000
if it's not Bitcoin, it's nothing right?
So how do we that's that's a hard hard

230
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:28,000
market to bust into and especially say
look, you know your protocol is amazing.

231
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:33,000
It's Bitcoin. It's digital gold It's been
around forever, right? It's the first one

232
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Well, not first one, but you know first
big one But here's a layer with Ergo that

233
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,000
can turn your Bitcoin into you know
lending platform peer-to-peer swaps all

234
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:48,000
that kind of stuff. So how do we I mean,
that's a market we have to break into, I

235
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,000
think, right? So I think that should be a
lot of our focus as well, is not only

236
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:58,000
preaching that to those people, but
showing by example, as well as marketing

237
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,000
to them.

238
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Right, so then maybe it's better to start
with, well, entities which do need for

239
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:23,000
monetary expansion, right, so which are
using Bitcoin for reserves, right, on

240
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:32,000
other levels, so it could be some small
community, right, or a big corporation.

241
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Because if there is some guy which just
bought Bitcoin and then claiming

242
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:50,000
superiority of Bitcoin, I mean, that's
understandable story, but I mean, what can

243
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:59,000
you do with that? It's just a guy who
bought, I mean, like brick of digital

244
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:08,000
gold. And that's it, right? So it's not
about need for derivatives, right, or

245
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:17,000
whatever. So then I think it's better to
find some partners in the real world. And

246
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:26,000
here we also had a lot of conversations
and, well, it's too early to announce

247
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:35,000
anything but yeah well actually Ergo is
now well I think since second half of 2024

248
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:44,000
so well it's now under radar of many
entities so from even Bitcoin OG whales I

249
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:53,000
know about some to some big Middle East
funds and so on. Now it's also known that

250
00:30:53,000 --> 00:31:02,000
it's under the radar of some Chinese funds
and so on so yeah well I think I think

251
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:11,000
well well, the recognition is coming,
right? Because, well, it's kind of an

252
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:20,000
interesting time, right?

253
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:35,000
So, well, again, back to consensus Hong
Kong. So, well, partly it was like meme

254
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:43,000
coins funeral, right? So, it was quite
clear to most people that after this scam

255
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:51,000
space, well, this scam space is going to
be, recognized, right? I mean, it was

256
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:59,000
quite clear, since like early days.

257
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Are very clear than what it is. Yeah.

258
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it was quite clear
that it's about scams, but you know, I

259
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:15,000
mean, when you have like billions at
stake, so you have, you know, like, CEOs

260
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:22,000
of centralized exchanges talking complete
nonsense like meme coins will be the next

261
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:29,000
cycle, which is completely insane. I mean,
it's like, I don't know.

262
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
But it's like, it's like, it's like
burning. It's burning paper to keep warm

263
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
instead of wood, you know, or coal.

264
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:44,000
But when you have stake, when you have
stake in it, then you can tell even such

265
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:52,000
nonsensical things, right? Like scams will
be the next big thing. Yeah, I mean, scams

266
00:32:52,000 --> 00:33:00,000
are always making crypto, unfortunately,
right? But I mean, making a trend out of

267
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:08,000
scams. So yeah, even biggest centralized
exchanges, which tried to push such absurd

268
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:16,000
nonsense back in 2024, now stepped down,
you know, because, well, it's way too

269
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:24,000
much, right? So retail cannot consume this
anymore, right? Because, well, I don't

270
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:32,000
know, it's too scammy to start with. I
mean, it's a much bigger scam than all

271
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:40,000
those previous scams, centralized
exchanges supported.

272
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Yeah, I hear that. That's the noisiest
part, right? I mean, those people as well,

273
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,000
unfortunately, once those things dry up,
they're looking for the next thing. And I

274
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,000
think we just have to keep shouting
utility and usefulness and that kind of

275
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,000
stuff to perhaps be picked up in whatever
cycle is coming next, but yeah, it's

276
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:03,000
really tough to you know, go somewhere and
talk about it and the number one thought

277
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,000
on people's mind is a crypto scam. Isn't
that the Trump coin isn't that the meme

278
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,000
coin, you know kind of thing so it's a
hard battle of fight against but I think

279
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Sigmanauts are positioned in a good way at
least because we have the we have the beef

280
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,000
right we have the stuff to back it up and
say look, you know, whenever that happens

281
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,000
and somebody says it's a scam I say hey
look, here's what we have on Ergo. Here's

282
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,000
what we're doing. You know, that's totally
wind going by us that we don't technically

283
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,000
listen to too often except when people
come in and FUD so in those conversations

284
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:35,000
I say we have this we have something like
SigmaFi where if you want to buy a car and

285
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,000
you have crypto that you don't want to
cash out necessarily you can You know

286
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:43,000
speculate a little bit and lend it, swap
it for SigmaUSD, cash out and then pay

287
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,000
yourself back slowly to repay the loan or
DuckPools or those kinds of financial

288
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,000
tools. So there's so much stuff on Ergo
that I can point to to these people to

289
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:55,000
make them think oh really? You know, that
can be done. That's not just a magic money

290
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,000
kind of thing. So I definitely think we're
well positioned more than anybody else in

291
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:03,000
that matter.

292
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Right. And yeah, also more interesting
tooling is coming. So index funds, for

293
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:39,000
example, right. Well, another iteration of
ErgoRaffle, I think it would be much more

294
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:48,000
useful for just ordinary folks, right,
which are willing to collect ERGs for

295
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:57,000
their project, for example, but USD,
right, or maybe even gold-denominated

296
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:06,000
assets such as Gluon or Dexy Gold. And,
yeah, so for Dexy Gold, well, as UI, well,

297
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:15,000
the second attempt to UI is quite near.
Hopefully we can launch well in coming

298
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:24,000
days, weeks. Let's see.

299
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,000
You see the beautiful, yeah, you see the
pictures from C8?

300
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So then, yeah, so well,
the plan, you know, is to, well, resolve

301
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:44,000
storage rent issue for SigmaUSD bank box
and then yeah well I can issue take last

302
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:52,000
look and generate with AI some more tests
for Dexy Gold but yeah that's just I don't

303
00:36:52,000 --> 00:37:00,000
know like one day one and a half and then
yeah we can go live. So, yeah, the Dexy

304
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Gluon, but then, yeah, index funds. Index
funds, I see them as, well, brick also for

305
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:16,000
building financial infrastructure. So, for
example, for ChainCash, right, well, if

306
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:24,000
you are willing to put, like, multiple
assets in reserve, then you can do your

307
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:32,000
index funds, right, put assets there and
then use index funds tokens as a ChainCash

308
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:40,000
reserve basically right and by that you
may have like multi-asset reserve and so

309
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:48,000
on and yeah well another thing which could
be quite interesting and yeah I'm

310
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:56,000
currently checking is to have
collateralized off-chain cash right with

311
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:04,000
well clearing off-chain clearing, and then
redemption to layer 2, but then most of

312
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:12,000
transactions in small communities, for
example, would be cleared before

313
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:20,000
redemption, so you can use it for charity,
instead of providing loans, you can just

314
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:28,000
who provides donations to some African
village for example so you can put

315
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:36,000
collateral and issue payment notes and
then most of them would be cleared on the

316
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:44,000
way so you have like 20x of economic
activity versus your collateral which is

317
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:52,000
much improvements right in comparison with
donation.

318
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Is this like an offshoot of ChainCash,
kushti, using kind of the same idea?

319
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:21,000
It's just off-chain collateralized cash.
But yeah, also you can go further, right?

320
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:29,000
So for example, you can put your funds,
not in like on-chain contracts, bound

321
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:37,000
collateral, but to DAO treasury, right?
For example. And then, yeah, these DAO may

322
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:45,000
vote which are not created within
community to redeem, right, which are not.

323
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:53,000
So when there is need to go outside, for
example, for some community, right, they

324
00:39:53,000 --> 00:40:01,000
can vote on redemption, right, but
otherwise you can have money circulation

325
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:09,000
within community just like an LETS system,
right? So without any collateral, without

326
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:17,000
anything, just IOU community notes, right?
And then in case of international, well,

327
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:25,000
inter-community trading, so you can go to
treasury. Actually, that's quite used in

328
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:33,000
some parts of Mexico, even. There are some
communities in Chiapas, for example, which

329
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:41,000
are quite autonomous, but they need some
money sometimes, and to make this money

330
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:49,000
they are selling coffee some premium
coffee actually, but they're selling just

331
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:57,000
a little bit to cover expenses needed when
they're interacting with outer world and

332
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:05,000
so on.

333
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Yeah, so, well, it's just like tools,
right, what we do have in DeFi, I believe.

334
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:23,000
And, well, it's now time, as there are
enough tools, to go outside and, well, to

335
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:31,000
become a reserve asset for different
calibers from small communities to, well,

336
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:39,000
as it's permissionless, right, and then
you can expect big players, well, even

337
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:47,000
maybe state level actors at some point
like happened with Bitcoin right no nobody

338
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:55,000
predicted that by the way back in 2010 it
wasn't it was it was quite anti-state

339
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:03,000
right back in 2010 but yeah it's happening
so and well you cannot prevent right this

340
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:11,000
and permissionless system but what's what
should be in focus for builders, I

341
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:19,000
believe, is how to serve, well, real
needs, right? And, well, communities

342
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:27,000
people in need. And then, I don't know,
big players will come, I think, because,

343
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:35,000
well, everyone will realize what's real,
what's not here after all.

344
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:40,000
I mean, that's a hope, right? Yeah. Let
me just give two quick updates before we

345
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:45,000
jump into questions. Maybe one, we've got
to vote up on Sigmanauts at least from the

346
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Sigmanauts side. We've got to vote up on
Sigmanauts to send neuro yogi Mark the

347
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Shark to Disrupt, which is a big mining
conference in Miami. So I think it's very

348
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:00,000
important that we Ergo as a proof of work
chain, even though you know, it's, there's

349
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:05,000
a lot of ASICs and those kinds of things
at this conference. That's the center of

350
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:10,000
it that we send somebody down there to
mill around say the word Ergo get people

351
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:15,000
out there and let them know that GPU
mining is there and benefits of it and the

352
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:20,000
peer-to-peer kind of resilience of it. So
that vote is a couple days in a couple

353
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:25,000
days more left. Hopefully it's looking
positive and we'll be able to fund them to

354
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:30,000
get out there. We'll make them a bunch of
business cards big ones with like a wallet

355
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:35,000
on the front and in the back things like
the Sigmanauts mining DAO or Rosen Bridge

356
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:40,000
or those kind of things where yeah you
know if you're mining Bitcoin over there

357
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:45,000
with your ASIC and you have a large store
of them why not put them to use why not

358
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:50,000
bring them over to Ergo and use our
learning systems, use our DAOs to help run

359
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:55,000
those things. So that's a message there
that we're hoping to do. And I think Mark

360
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:00,000
will be very successful at it.

361
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:05,000
We also have a vote up. We've revamped
our SigShop. So you might see some new

362
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:09,000
postings on MewFinance. HQx is going to
handle all that front end stuff. And then

363
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:13,000
we've got myself to ship them out to you
once they come in. So we've kind of

364
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:17,000
divided up the work as opposed to all
being on one person. So those are up.

365
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:21,000
We've got all the inventory matched with
his site. So please order away, order your

366
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:25,000
stuff. We've got hats, sweatshirts, and
t-shirts. Once those run out, we'll talk

367
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,000
about doing different stuff and maybe take
votes on what you want to see next for

368
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:33,000
swag. So those are the two things out of
the Sigmanauts. Anything out of the

369
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:37,000
developers DAO question specifically
before we go to questions?

370
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Yeah, so we're also having first voting.
So yeah, the key is distributed. And yeah,

371
00:44:53,000 --> 00:45:01,000
well, I'm having some issues with my
voting to try to understand. But yeah,

372
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:09,000
it's quite exciting to see it's in action
in the form of DAO. So yeah, well, and

373
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:17,000
well, it's also good to see more
contributors. So well, we have some guys

374
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:25,000
back now, like Corbey Chalador, and some
new guys. So there was quite intense

375
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:33,000
developers chat yesterday. And yeah,
that's just the beginning, I believe.

376
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Nice, yeah, I'm looking at Paideia now.
You guys have your first vote up that's

377
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,000
active. 100% yes, it looks like it's going
to pass.

378
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So we'll do more. And
yeah, so there is also a fundraising I'm

379
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:59,000
doing for DevsDAO basically. So for
security audit of 6.0 to be made by Dusek.

380
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Actually, he already found quite a lot of
issues, right? Especially around

381
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:15,000
versioning. It would be good to do more
audit. We continue to check all the

382
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:23,000
things. But yeah, well, he found even some
non-trivial DOS possibilities. So yeah,

383
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:31,000
that's quite amazing. I think should be
rewarded. So please check raffles on

384
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:39,000
ergoraffle.com.

385
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:47,000
All right, very cool. All right, let's
dive in. We've got... Let's see. I had to

386
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:53,000
mute the Big 3D. He was being a little
special there, but let's see if he has any

387
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:59,000
good questions in the beginning. Well
we'll take this from him. It won't let me

388
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:05,000
show it actually. Let me see. All right.
All right. Let me show it. It won't let me

389
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:11,000
show this question, but I'll read it. He
says, the Big 3D says what's happening

390
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:17,000
with Kraken is Ergo. Will it be listed in
the future? So you don't know there was a

391
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:23,000
there was a comment by Dave I believe it
said his name Peter maybe I can't keep

392
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:29,000
track of the Dave and Peters on the on
there, let me look it up. It is Peter that

393
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:35,000
said that you know, it were there was some
misunderstandings in his his response

394
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:41,000
there but we as Sigmanauts are thrifty,
right and useful of our resources, so we

395
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:47,000
are currently trying to go through another
method to get our voices heard behind the

396
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Kraken lines. So keep you updated as it
can go, but we'll see what happens, right?

397
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:59,000
And furthermore, we always have Rosen-ERG
to back up on. That application is in.

398
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Peter's aware of it. You know, we got the
classic DM response of, you know, we have

399
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:11,000
a lot of things in our backlog, but we're
hoping our new countermeasure to penetrate

400
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:17,000
their defenses will go off smoothly. So
we'll see how that goes.

401
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:29,000
All right, all right. But yeah, well, as
I have some experience of talking with

402
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:37,000
centralized exchanges. Talks with MEXC
started, for example, back in 2019. I had

403
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:45,000
some calls and a lot of talks with one of
the top managers, actually. I don't know,

404
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:53,000
maybe because it was a small exchange
maybe back then. Quite small.

405
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Well, a lot of these things happen,
kushti, with personal relationships,

406
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,000
right? So, I mean, that's technically the
avenue we're attempting here. So, yeah.

407
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Right. So, yeah. Well, relationships and
also a lot of, but again, always

408
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:19,000
happening, right? With MEXC, it started
with like 5 Bitcoin, right? But finally,

409
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:27,000
well, it was community fundraiser. For how
much in total, like 60k? I don't know, for

410
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:35,000
40k, 60k, something like that. Yeah, and
well, yeah, and it was much better than

411
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:43,000
five Bitcoin, right? And well, it was also
about much bigger exchange in 2024 than

412
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:51,000
back in 2019. Right, so, well, you know,
if you are not listed, then you can always

413
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:59,000
be in talks, right, so they are not
finishing, so, well, there is no point

414
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:07,000
here, right, so, period, I mean, here,
well, until it's listed. Right. So well,

415
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:15,000
we have another rounds and, let's see,
well, whether, we will be successful in

416
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:23,000
these rounds or another one.

417
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Yeah. But yeah, I mean, that's just game
rights. Quite strange, but, well, yeah, I

418
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:41,000
think actually, well, it should be in
focus maybe at this point. Well, there is

419
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:49,000
need for some U.S. exchange, right, for
sure. Critical needs maybe depending on

420
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:57,000
community feedback but other than that so
it's always better to spread vision right

421
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:05,000
and well to take care about recognition
and getting more Sigmanauts on board and

422
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:13,000
we'll get more builders, right? And yeah,
well, to build liquidity around and so on.

423
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:21,000
And then yes, centralized exchanges will
come, right? Naturally. But yeah, well, at

424
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:29,000
the same time, it's good to continue to
talk, at least to get temperature right in

425
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:37,000
the room.

426
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:47,000
No, right. Yeah. I mean, brigading, too,
is also fun online, right? I love seeing

427
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:52,000
the Sigmanauts bomb, Twitter bomb Kraken,
and Dave and Peter. It's always fun to

428
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:57,000
see. That's, I think, that's a good
indicator of a live community, and that

429
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:02,000
shouldn't be stopped. That's great.

430
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:08,000
We have a comment for the website. I
think you need to update their website

431
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:12,000
team Some links are broken some CEXes that
listed Ergo, but not linked on Ergo

432
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:16,000
website. That's I believe you can suggest
changes to that or maybe that's dev docs

433
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:20,000
on the Ergo website, but that's Glasgow,
ping Glasgow. That man's happy to fix

434
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:24,000
everything and he will be surprised if
there are things like that so please ping

435
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Glasgow directly to make him aware of that
kind of stuff for the website.

436
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Let's see. Here's a question from Bobcat.
He's wondering, are there any plans to do

437
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:40,000
joint eUTXO hackathons with either Cardano
or Bitcoin ecosystems to increase

438
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:44,000
visibility?

439
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Yeah that'd be nice with Rosen right with
Rosen it's interoperable right you can

440
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:58,000
have a joint hackathon and have a common
token between them so yeah it's possible

441
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:04,000
but the question is would would others be
willing to do that right we're part of

442
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:10,000
somewhat part of the UTXO alliance so I
guess we could start it there yeah there

443
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:16,000
but you know actually it's interesting
idea so well I can I can bring awareness

444
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:22,000
to UTXO alliance calls and maybe it's what
to discuss with Cardano peers as well.

445
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:30,000
So in the last week we spoke about, we
spoke about a mini hackathon for,

446
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:34,000
sponsored by the Sigmanauts and it jumps
off of Mark's idea to specifically train

447
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:38,000
an AI model to not only write ErgoScript
and smart contracts, but to check it too.

448
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:42,000
So you have one that does both, or you
have a specially trained model to write it

449
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:46,000
in a special chain model to check it. So
those kinds of things could also be, you

450
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:50,000
know, that could be across many chain
collaboration with Cardano to get it to

451
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:54,000
write smart contracts and Cardano as well
as Ergo. So maybe we can see if Mark knows

452
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:58,000
anybody over in Cardano land or any
Sigmanauts do to see if anybody's

453
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:02,000
interested that that may be something
coming down the pipe.

454
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:18,000
No, let's see. Well, it would be funny
even to have maybe Bitcoin and

455
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:26,000
ErgoHackathon. But we need to do some
counterpart. Because we can do stuff like

456
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:34,000
DLC contracts and the different atomic
swaps and so on. So, well, things which

457
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:42,000
are quite quite common for both
blockchains, right? So I don't know. Let's

458
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:50,000
see. Let me also answer from FC Alex
thoughts. So if any on recent discussions,

459
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:58,000
that's Jack Dorsey, Satoshi, no comment.
Yeah. So, you know, Satoshi is not some I

460
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:06,000
don't know, philosopher, like writer, or
the internet, right, like fiction writer.

461
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:14,000
But yeah, so he is a developer, C++
developer, and he is using, he used I

462
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:22,000
mean, quite unique style of coding, right?
So then she show me Jack Dorsey C++ code

463
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:30,000
and I can tell her. But yeah, I'm pretty
sure he's not because I'm not quite sure,

464
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Jack Dorsey used C++ ever in his life. And
you know, Satoshi's C++, I mean, it's

465
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:46,000
quite unique, as I said, so it's not like
professional corporate developers C++,

466
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:54,000
more like hacker or InfoSec, maybe
developer C++. Right, so well, it's quite

467
00:55:54,000 --> 00:56:02,000
unique and it's a thing which you cannot
really fake, I believe, especially back

468
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:10,000
then, right, without AI and whatever.
Because, yeah, well, there are some things

469
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:18,000
like how you work with stack and so on,
which are showing what you are usually

470
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:26,000
doing. And so, yeah, well, based on that,
Satoshi was quite like a hacker, an

471
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:34,000
InfoSec developer, maybe. Not a professor
in cryptography, for example, definitely

472
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:42,000
not a corporate developer. not Jack
Dorsey, not Nick Szabo and so on, right?

473
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:50,000
Well, in regards with other candidates,
the first question is, show me the code,

474
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:58,000
right? Well, especially around that time.
So, for example, I found some Adam Back's

475
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:06,000
code from 2007 on the Internet, and yeah,
I can say that Adam Back is not Satoshi as

476
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:14,000
well right because well it's it's quite
different so and you cannot really change

477
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:22,000
style in like months you know right okay
let's see we've yeah sorry gone we've got

478
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:30,000
let's answer this really quickly for
people wondering.

479
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Why did Joe leave the foundation? I think
from my understanding Joe leaving the

480
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:54,000
foundation gave him more flexibility to
run his own projects, right? So now he

481
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:58,000
could focus more on Rosen Bridge which
needs a ton of focus, right? They're not

482
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:02,000
only dealing with you know, it's not like
they're dealing with one chain here

483
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:06,000
They're dealing with Cardano Bitcoin
Ethereum Binance and he's got a fairly

484
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:10,000
large team to run as well. So so all that
kind of stuff, as well as all of Joe's

485
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:14,000
musings, I believe led Joe to want more
flexibility in that kind of project

486
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:18,000
running. So that's why he took the leap
there. That's my understanding.

487
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:30,000
Yeah. And Joe's around. Yeah. Well, we
have talks like daily, maybe. Well,

488
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:35,000
almost. And yeah. So, he's also publishing
quite nice articles, these days. Right.

489
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:40,000
He's got like four or five that he sent
me.

490
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:47,000
Yeah. Very nice. Yeah. What's, what are
they? The, the internet?

491
00:58:47,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Yeah. Yeah, but also a new proof-of-work
scheme, tailored for high-performance

492
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:13,000
AI-oriented GPUs like H100. Yeah, that's
quite interesting.

493
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:18,000
Those 85 gig memory GPUs, what to do with
them after they get dueled for AI. He's

494
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:23,000
got a nice write-up on that. Pretty cool.
Yeah.

495
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:31,000
Yeah. Well, and also some modification to
the Bitcoin runes protocol to have

496
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:39,000
metadata which can be used then maybe for
Ergo applications.

497
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:46,000
All right. Let's see here. We have Bobcat
wants to know if there's any follow-up to

498
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Navjit the CEO at Iagon Yeah, Bobcat.
That's we spoken with him that's part of

499
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:58,000
the path that we're looking forward to
build a real relationship with somebody

500
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:04,000
behind the lines of Kraken so thankfully
Navjit has some connections and we're

501
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:10,000
moving forward with that the best we can
so very grateful for Navjit to reach out

502
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:16,000
to us on Twitter very thankful let's see
we've got you want to talk about.

503
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:26,000
All right. Let's see. Misfit toy has two
questions. They're centered around

504
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:31,000
sub-blocks, but he's saying, Mr. McCracken
from ADA, from Cardano says the biggest

505
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:36,000
hurdle for Ergo getting adopted more and
it's the slowness. Do you agree? Then the

506
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:41,000
follow up question is how fast will
sub-blocks make Ergo fast in Solana? He

507
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:46,000
says it'll be one of the fastest period to
peak, but not AWS. What's the difference

508
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:51,000
kind of thing. So I guess a general
question about, in summary, kushti, are

509
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:56,000
two-minute block times causing a slowness
and adoption of Ergo and will sub-blocks

510
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:01,000
appease those people who want fast
confirmation times?

511
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:11,000
Yeah, I don't know. So, well, I never
heard, for example, that's, you know, like

512
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:18,000
10 minutes blocks. Well, it's a problem
for Bitcoin adoption.

513
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:25,000
Right. What is it? 10 minute blocks on
Bitcoin? Bitcoin is 10. I can't remember.

514
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:33,000
So it's 10 on average, but yeah, there
was the case once when, you know, like

515
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:41,000
many years ago, I met one guy to cash out.
And yeah, we did wait for block, well,

516
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:49,000
some space for like, one hour and a half.
Yes. So sometimes you can wait like two

517
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:57,000
hours for Bitcoin block. And, yeah, well,
I, I never heard that this is a problem

518
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:05,000
for adoption. I mean, it, it depends on
what, what, what, what adoption looks

519
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:13,000
like. Right. So, well, it's, if adoption
is about, well, games and sandbox again,

520
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:21,000
like, well uh having a meme coin casino
right like pump.fun then yeah maybe yeah i

521
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:29,000
mean it's but i mean it's not some some
kind of adoption which is expected, right?

522
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:37,000
And Ergo protocol could not be good here.
Well, not because of block time, but

523
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:45,000
because of peer-to-peer nature, right? So
when you have like hundreds of laptops,

524
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:53,000
ordinary laptops, like you're using some
laptop, right? qx(). for running an Ergo

525
01:02:53,000 --> 01:03:01,000
node and so probably you wouldn't be happy
to see it's been overloaded because of

526
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:09,000
some casino, right?

527
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:21,000
Yeah, so then there are some specialized
networks which are not peer-to-peer

528
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:28,000
actually like Solana and so on and so on,
right, which are well suited for meme

529
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:35,000
casinos or tap games or all that stuff.
So, well, it's quite pointless to talk

530
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:42,000
about competition with them, because it's
different classes, right? I mean, you

531
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:49,000
cannot compare peer-to-peer network with
data center-based BFT, somewhat. But block

532
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:56,000
time, it's the same. I mean, if it's
peer-to-peer, it's it would be like Ergo

533
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:03,000
in a way right and then yeah if it's data
center based and yeah you can have a meme

534
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:10,000
coin casino right talking about adoption
right no not not just confirmation time so

535
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:17,000
that the question is what adoption is
right and so if we are talking about

536
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:24,000
things like, I don't know, programmable,
digital, gold-like assets for a resource

537
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:31,000
of any caliber, right? Then, yeah, well,
it's two minutes block is okay. And there

538
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:38,000
is no issue here.

539
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:48,000
Yeah, that's something that's

540
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:55,000
Yeah, then if we are talking about
payments, right, like the very natural

541
01:04:55,000 --> 01:05:02,000
thing you can do with money, then yeah, I
mean, it's then sub-blocks would make a

542
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:09,000
difference. But yeah, I believe after all,
with adoption, so most of transactions

543
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:16,000
even in regards with payments would be
off-chain, right? Because well, it's

544
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:23,000
whether you have sub-blocks or whatever
the question is. Can your laptop do that,

545
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:30,000
right? Also being connected with hundreds,
thousands of laptops around the globe. And

546
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:37,000
if it's about some crazy meme coins
casino, then yeah, there is no technology,

547
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:44,000
right, which can do magic here, right? I
mean, there is no magic. We have just a

548
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:51,000
data center based systems which are doing
great finance like meme coins casino but

549
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:58,000
then it's I mean it's simply dangerous for
the founders maybe even right to some

550
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:05,000
point because it's it's pretty much like
having PayPal right but also without any

551
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:12,000
licenses and yeah, also with a crazy
casino on top of with a lot of crazy

552
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:19,000
events happening like daily from
presidential rugpulls to now also

553
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:26,000
suicides, right, and live streams.

554
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Absolutely insane, yeah.

555
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:35,000
And so, yeah, and if it's run on top of
centralized system like Solana, right, and

556
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:40,000
so on, then at some point there would be
question of responsibility, right, of

557
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:45,000
organizers of all such systems.

558
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:50,000
Yeah, I think I think that'll come with
education custody I think I think you know

559
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:54,000
people just touching systems based on meme
tokens. That's all they see right They see

560
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:58,000
why isn't Ergo able to support this or why
aren't people flocking to Ergo for this

561
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:02,000
kind of craze and I think it's a matter of
time in the ecosystem and a realization of

562
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:06,000
what blockchain the sustainability of
blockchains actually is in the future and

563
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:10,000
that's what Ergo is, in my opinion,
peer-to-peer networks, finance, tooling,

564
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:14,000
that kind of thing.

565
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:23,000
So it's just an education thing, I think,
when people make that distinction of...

566
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:31,000
Yeah, going back to Satoshi, so he also
stated pretty clear why peer-to-peer

567
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:39,000
structure of network was chosen, right,
and why Bitcoin is following certain

568
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:47,000
paradigms and Bitcoin not appeared out of
something, right. So there were more

569
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:55,000
centralized payment systems which were
shut down before, right? And so Bitcoin

570
01:07:55,000 --> 01:08:03,000
was actually quite a counter reaction to
those shutdowns, right? So yeah, I mean,

571
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:11,000
and well, it seems it's all it's all
silenced these days right so well for some

572
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:19,000
reason we need to to have something with
totally idiotic discourse rights, which is

573
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:27,000
completely ignoring the history of
cryptocurrencies, of Bitcoin, of payment

574
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:35,000
systems, after all, pre-Bitcoin payment
systems. Then the next question, how fast

575
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:43,000
will sub-blocks make Ergo faster than
Solana? Yeah, so it could be maybe faster

576
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:51,000
for some notion of confirmation, right?
But yeah, still still, it, it, it wouldn't

577
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:59,000
be about, you know, like, bringing, I
don't know, millions of transactions, to,

578
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:07,000
to, to hopefully laptops.

579
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:23,000
Hopefully we can program in some failed
transactions to them, given that same

580
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:26,000
experience.

581
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,000
Sorry.

582
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:30,000
Hopefully we can program in some failed
transactions just to give them the same

583
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:33,000
experience.

584
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:40,000
A lot of system messages to be counted as
transactions and so on. Yeah. So actually

585
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:46,000
a performance wise proof of work protocols
like Ergo are the best, but then yeah, you

586
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:52,000
need to consider that there is peer to
peer network after all. Right. And there

587
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:58,000
is commodity here. Well, because there is
need to have secure network, not data

588
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:04,000
center-based network with not so efficient
even BFT protocol, consensus protocol, but

589
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:10,000
also with very centralized approach to
everything.

590
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:17,000
We've got a good question from CLS90ZZZ
on Rosen. What happens if Rosen guards do

591
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:21,000
a mistake like Bybit multi-sign instead
once the Rosen-ERG price crash versus ERG

592
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:25,000
on Bybit? If you've got your funds out,
you're fine. But with Rosen, you look

593
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:29,000
exposed forever. So I can give a stab at
that question. You can correct me. If I'm

594
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:33,000
if I'm wrong. So Rosen has right so in
order to fake out Rosen you need to

595
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:37,000
socially attack the watchers and I guess
hack the guards, right? So you have to

596
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:41,000
socially engineer the guards or else find
out their locations and their IPs and what

597
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:45,000
machines are running them on and try to
hack that so remember, the Bybit Multi-Sig

598
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:49,000
error was going from a cold wallet to
another wallet, redoing the contract for

599
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:53,000
that. So if you're talking about watchers
and guards, first of all, you'd have to

600
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:57,000
get a majority of the watchers fake an
actual transaction right and then the

601
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:01,000
guards would find that transaction and
most likely they'd catch it and see that

602
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:05,000
it was a fake transaction right somehow so
you have that double layer there let's say

603
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:09,000
you compromise the guards on top of that
right the guards would have the guards

604
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:13,000
still need to look on the chain so you'd
have to essentially compromise both the

605
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:17,000
watcher system and the guard systems to
get a fake transaction through that way

606
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:21,000
right so let's go to the cold wallet side.

607
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:37,000
The way that we work from cold wallet on
the guards is we literally have cold

608
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:41,000
devices that we initiate transactions on.
So in order to fake us out there, you

609
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:45,000
would then have to compromise one of the
guards and initiate a cold signing

610
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:49,000
transaction that we see that. It's not
broadcast anywhere. We do it with our

611
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:53,000
local communications group. So in the
beauty about Ergo, the beauty about

612
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:57,000
pulling things from cold storage, even in
Cardano, is that we can see exactly what

613
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:01,000
address it's going to, right? There's no
complexity as there would be in something

614
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:05,000
like the Bybit attack where they can
change the multi-sig contract without you

615
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:09,000
even really knowing, right? They can mask
it. So on Ergo, everything's perfectly

616
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:13,000
viewable before we sign cold transactions
to get them into the hot wallet. We can

617
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:17,000
say, okay, here's the originating wallet.
Yep, here are the boxes in the originating

618
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:21,000
wallet. Here are the funds that are
transferring, and here's the wallet it's

619
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:25,000
going to, and it's visible every step of
the way. So that kind of Bybit attack

620
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:29,000
would be extremely hard or near impossible
on Rosen Bridge or Ergo. kushti, you want

621
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:33,000
to correct or fix?

622
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
kushti, you want to correct or fix?

623
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:52,000
I can add that Multisig is also done very
differently from Ethereum and Solana,

624
01:12:52,000 --> 01:13:00,000
right? Well, in Ethereum and Solana, for
example, it's about some predefined

625
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:08,000
contracts SDK contracts and well there was
issue with re-entrancy for example there

626
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:16,000
which resulted into wormhole hack of 120
million USD so in Ethereum that's about

627
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:24,000
well again some contracts not even
standard to the best of my knowledge then

628
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:32,000
yeah there were different contracts so for
example parity which also lost like

629
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:40,000
hundreds of millions back then probably in
current prices much more like I don't know

630
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:48,000
billions maybe because of yeah well
contracts had possibility for everyone to

631
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:56,000
nuke it and then yeah some schoolboy nuked
it and then, yeah, so he wrote on Reddit

632
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:04,000
or some forum, I've forgotten, like, oh,
yeah, yeah, your contract is allowing for

633
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:12,000
call suicide. And yeah, I just made
suicide call and it seems instead. So, you

634
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:20,000
know, for a lot of funds, so Parity funds
got from Polkadot ICO and also funds of

635
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:28,000
users of that library, multi-sig library,
but Parity were lost. Other contracts also

636
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:36,000
not immutable. I still need to check
details, but it seems it was the case. Not

637
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:44,000
an immutable multi-sig. So in case of
Ergo, Multisig is immutable, right? So

638
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:52,000
it's natively supported. There are no
re-entrancy calls and so on because, well,

639
01:14:52,000 --> 01:15:00,000
no re-entrancy here. And yeah, well, it's
also truly ZK, right? So from, if ZK is

640
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:08,000
used, ZK signature is used by guards. But
probably it's right, because it's about

641
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:16,000
some custom software, so then it's
possible. So then, yeah, well, it's very

642
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:24,000
different, actually, implementation of
Multisig. Well, on Ergo, blockchain versus

643
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:32,000
Ethereum and so on. Well, it's much
simpler and immutable, so safer in general

644
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:40,000
for users, I believe.

645
01:15:56,000 --> 01:16:01,000
Yeah. Yeah. They'd have to literally
change sources from that. So we'd see that

646
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:06,000
in the transaction, that it was actually
going to another wallet. So that would be

647
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:11,000
very hard to pull the wool over the eyes
of the guards in that matter. So yeah. All

648
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:16,000
right. Let's see. We've got, let's see,
one more question. I think this is a good

649
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:21,000
question. We have many whales in Ergo.
What advice would you give to them to

650
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:26,000
utilize a margin investment to maybe get
some type of return? or to help with

651
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:31,000
adoption with a large investment. kushti,
the amount of times I see arbitrage

652
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:36,000
opportunities on the chains that Ergo is
linking to, whether it was Rosen Bridge,

653
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:41,000
there's many arbitrage opportunities for
whales to utilize that. There's lending on

654
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:46,000
DuckPools, there's lending on SigmaFi,
they're supporting projects as well that

655
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:51,000
come up as well support early and and work
with them for your investment there, too

656
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:56,000
so that would be my spit out of what
whales can do to help bolster the

657
01:16:56,000 --> 01:17:01,000
ecosystem as well as their own their own
bags to help them work for them. We do

658
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:06,000
have we do currently have whales doing
some arbitrage across but not as much as

659
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:11,000
could be done. That's for sure We had a
whale try to tank DuckPools the other day,

660
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:16,000
right they they changed the, what's it
called? They tried to lower the price,

661
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:21,000
with lowering the price of ERG and the
demand on the SigmaUSD pool, it liquidated

662
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:26,000
a lot of users. So that's a not very good
way to make use your bags. So that's for

663
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:31,000
sure. I'm kind of dishonest, but it's
financial, you know, it's permissionless.

664
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:36,000
That's financial linked to tooling. So, I
mean, you got to watch out for that stuff.

665
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:41,000
But yeah, in the short arbitrage, SigmaFi
DuckPools, supporting projects are great

666
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:46,000
ways to make use your bags work for you.

667
01:17:51,000 --> 01:18:00,000
Yeah well and getting providing more
liquidity right so getting better

668
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:09,000
liquidity everywhere so it's quite
profitable for whales so well Cardano

669
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:18,000
whales it seems I know most of folks
provided liquidity on Cardano DEXes and

670
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:27,000
yeah it seems they're quite happy about,
well, APY, all that stuff, you know, and,

671
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:36,000
well, it's, it seems so liquidity
provision is also good for a price, right?

672
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:45,000
Because, well, people need to buy ERG then
there is need for liquidity, right? And...

673
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:50,000
Not just ERG, right? Not just ERG, there
are many opportunities on Spectrum, on

674
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:54,000
Ergo DEXes, as well where you can create
yield farms, right? Yeah, so if you want

675
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:58,000
to invest your Rosen-ERG bag, your ERG bag
into projects, and then provide liquidity

676
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:02,000
for those projects on DEXes, you could
also yield farm. So you'll be getting

677
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:06,000
extra token bonuses from those yield farms
too. So keep an eye out for those kinds of

678
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:10,000
things too, and snap those up when you
can.

679
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:21,000
Right, but then, yeah, so Spectrum,
Uniswap, PancakeSwap, then there is

680
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:27,000
Spectrum DEX, right, and here is also...
MewDex, MewDex, kushti.

681
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:35,000
MewDex, yeah, so there is also, well,
need for liquidity, so... there are many

682
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:43,000
pairs which can be created in order to get
from arbitrage just for example Gluon Gold

683
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:51,000
to SigmaUSD right pool it's probably not
there right but then you can naturally

684
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:59,000
earn through arbitrage with ERG pool and
the same for many assets actually so I

685
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:07,000
haven't seen even ADA to ERG and then
again, you can earn from arbitrage. So

686
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:15,000
bots will do arbitrage automatically.

687
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:20,000
If you guys watch the Rosen Bridge
website, you'll see 40,000 ERGs going back

688
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:25,000
and forth, 50,000 ERGs going back and
forth, hitting these arbitrage

689
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:30,000
opportunities. So it's being done, but it
needs some more competition, I think.

690
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:39,000
Yeah, but then there is need for more
thick Bitcoin liquidity, Bitcoin, and so

691
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:46,000
on, right? So, well, I think whales have
not just ERGs, probably also Bitcoin,

692
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:53,000
USDT, and so on, right? So then, yeah, a
lot of liquidity provision which would be

693
01:20:53,000 --> 01:21:00,000
good for Ergo, right? After all, because
well, the deeper liquidity is yeah, about

694
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:07,000
more possibilities everywhere. All right,
so yeah, it seems, yeah, it's time to end

695
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:14,000
the AMA, right?

696
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
We've gone, I've got to get back to real
work, kushti. All right, everybody, thanks

697
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
so much for joining. It's been a pleasure.
Thanks for all the questions. That was

698
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
great.

699
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:30,000
Alright, alright. Yeah, thank you
everyone. Thank you, bye.
