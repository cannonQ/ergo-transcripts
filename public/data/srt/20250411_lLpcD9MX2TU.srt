1
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, and a
hey, hey ho. And yeah, this, you know, do

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,000
not adjust your television. We are
controlling the transmission on this

3
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
YouTube channel, because that's how
YouTube works. But anyway, yeah, so this

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
is your weekly AMA with me and, wait a
second. OK, so we got kushti here. We all

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,000
know him. And so the other guy without the
hat kind of looks like the guy with the

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,000
hat they usually hear. But anyway, say hi
to everybody. Guys with and without hats.

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Good morning, everybody.

8
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Hi, everyone. My pleasure to be here
again.

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Morning? It's not morning, it's evening.
What the hell, what are you talking about?

10
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Quality extreme, yeah yeah. So there's a
lot of exciting stuff happening in the

11
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Ergoverse. I'm actually pretty excited
about the Disco Solaris crossover. That's

12
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,000
really cool. I always really like the art
and Disco Solaris. That's kind of like my

13
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,000
cup of tea, you know, that kind of stuff
like new futuristic stuff or whatever you

14
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,000
call it. I always liked it so I'm glad
that they bridged over to ERG and looks

15
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:54,000
like they're actually already moving some
NFTs. Do you have, do you guys have a

16
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Disco Solaris Ergo NFT yet? I don't, not
yet but yeah I'll try to buy some.

17
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Yeah, that's MewFinance is doing it
automated, right? So they'll read the

18
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
metadata on Cardano and dump it into
register over on Ergo and remint a token.

19
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
And they don't burn it all the way back.

20
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
They throw it in a lock contract. Yeah.
What's that? The Dark Lord or Dark Knight.

21
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Darko, Danny Darko, he told me that
they're mewing it over there. Like I said,

22
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I'm just happy to see that because I've
always been an admirer of Disco Solaris

23
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,000
when it was even just on Cardano. The
community has always been really cool. I

24
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,000
know the people that made that project.
You know, they always kind of try to just

25
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,000
kind of be really community focused. So,
yeah, I'm glad that they're on Ergo,

26
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,000
because I know they've always actually
been fans. So I'm glad that they finally

27
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,000
kind of decided to move to Ergo. So what
else do we have? Some emission reduction?

28
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,000
We emit less now?

29
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
We do. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

30
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Yeah, that happened the other day. We're
down to, what is it, 15, kushti?

31
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Yeah, so 15 now. And yeah, it's quite an
amazing house. Well, somewhat it was.

32
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I think it's a good opportunity to
mention that Sigmanauts Mining Pool remind

33
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
people that they're collecting storage
rent and that hopefully at this point can

34
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
do a little bit of offsetting compared to,
you know, taking into account the emission

35
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
reduction. So for those of you not in a
pool or in a pool and want bonus tokens

36
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
and storage rent, join up with the
Sigmanauts Pool, please.

37
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Wow, you sound really excited about that
QX.

38
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Was that too formulaic? That was too,
like, monotone, wasn't it? Yeah, that was

39
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:10,000
a little bit like... Hey guys, join up
with the Sigmanauts pool. Is that better?

40
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Now you're getting all choppy and
robotic. I mean, you know, you kind of

41
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
are, but still, though, you shouldn't be
as choppy and robotic as usual. Yeah,

42
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
yeah, so that's cool. What else has been
going on?

43
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Well, we're talking about an Ergo meetup
in Colorado Springs this September, early

44
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
October.

45
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I saw Joe talk about that. That would be
really cool. Yeah, actually, what did he

46
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
say that he was going to, he's thinking of
doing it?

47
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
It's either the first weekend in
September, which is like the third, or

48
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
else like the 10th, whatever the first two
weekends are. We're going to put out a

49
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
vote to see which one is more attractive
to the most people.

50
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Well, you know what would actually be
really cool would actually be to make it

51
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
around the time where Evo is happening in
Vegas, because you're going to have a

52
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
bunch of people like, I mean, Vegas is not
super close, but it's not super far either

53
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
from Colorado. I'll be there, so I'd love
to make it out. I don't know if I'll be

54
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
able to come out to the US just for that,
but if I'm already in the US, I could make

55
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
an effort to come out, and I'm sure others
would as well, since they're all in the

56
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
same. But anyway, that's something to talk
to Joe about, I think. But I think that

57
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
might make sense. I don't know.

58
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
So Rare Evo 2025 is when?

59
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
It's the beginning of August, I think.

60
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Oh, that's pretty close.

61
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Pretty close. It's April.

62
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I know, but planning, Dan, planning,
organizing. We got to get the band. We got

63
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
to get the strippers, that kind of stuff,
you know.

64
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Well, I already got those tokenized, so
it's good to go.

65
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I will put out a community vote and see
what people want to do.

66
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
This is not a democracy. This is like a
little bit of a democracy. It's controlled

67
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
by a select group of secret individuals.

68
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Joe's got a location that he's got to
check dates on that's not always

69
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
available, so we've got to work around
that. Hotel prices weren't terrible in the

70
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
area. I think around September it was like
120 bucks a night or something like that.

71
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Or you just pitch a tent on one of Joe's
2000 acres kind of thing. Doesn't Joe like

72
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
own a mountain or something or parts of
mountains?

73
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Yeah, just there's caves we can we can
you know, we can just go in a cave or

74
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
something and just you know Airbnb that.
Yeah, 100.

75
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,000
What else is happening? Was it last week
or this week? We had some GraphQL issues

76
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:12,000
if people were noticing. Two of the three
load balancers went down. Load balance

77
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,000
machines were not performing well, I
guess. So they just needed to bounce with

78
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,000
NGINX and they worked fine after that. But
that brought us to how Nautilus works.

79
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Right now Nautilus defaults to Sigma space
GraphQL. But hidden there's a hidden list

80
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:36,000
of rollover servers for GraphQL and right
now in the Ergo ecosystem we have at least

81
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:42,000
four or five maybe six public ones so
we're getting Captain Nemo a list just to

82
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,000
make sure he's got them all so that if
something like this happens again then

83
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:54,000
it'll keep rolling over to all the
available GraphQL servers kind of thing so

84
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:00,000
that was interesting to see those. It's
good to see where the choke points are

85
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,000
that we've overlooked before before things
go crazy, right? So that was good and bad

86
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,000
at the same time to see, I think. Dan,
what about, we get a lot of questions

87
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:18,000
about Palmyra and all that kind of stuff
lately, how's Palmyra going?

88
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Who?

89
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Palm Myra.

90
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Who's that? Do I know her? Oh, yeah,
yeah, yeah. So, you know, we got the

91
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:43,000
launch on the 14th of August. And this is
going to be the very, very first

92
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:50,000
cross-chain launch using Rosen Bridge. So
we're going to be utilizing Rosen Bridge

93
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:57,000
to launch on both Cardano and Binance on
BNB. So that's going to be really cool. So

94
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:04,000
we're using DEXs on both Cardano and
Binance. We're going to be launching on

95
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:11,000
MintSwap on the Cardano side and on
PancakeSwap on the EVM side. We're already

96
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:18,000
talking to Mo and Joe and making sure that
everything is kosher. We have staking on

97
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:25,000
both. The thing about it is, I was talking
to Mew about potentially doing something

98
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:32,000
over there. The problem is that so one of
the things that we ran into when we were

99
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:39,000
finalizing everything for TGE is we had to
get approval from the Seychelles FSA. So

100
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:46,000
the company that actually is minting the
tokens is a Seychelles company. It's not

101
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:53,000
from Palmyra. It's from a partner company.
And that company had to get a license from

102
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:00,000
the Seychelles FSA, which was the first
actually ever utility token license issued

103
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:07,000
over there, which is pretty cool, I think,
and that was issued for Palm. And that

104
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:14,000
took quite a bit of time, well, not quite,
but more time than we thought it was going

105
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:21,000
to take or hoped that it was going to take
because it was literally, we're literally

106
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:28,000
the first ones to go through the
regulatory process. And so we finally did

107
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:35,000
get it. The thing about it is that to keep
it classified as a utility token and not a

108
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:42,000
security, there has to be clear utility in
every chain. And so essentially what we

109
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:49,000
need to have is staking support for every
chain. So right now we have Cardano, we

110
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:56,000
have EVM because that's where our main
token supply is on. We still haven't built

111
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:03,000
it out for Ergo. So once we build it out
for Ergo, which is obviously in the

112
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:10,000
pipeline, then we're also going to be able
to start a liquidity pool on Ergo, as in

113
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:17,000
us doing it. Without that, we can't
officially do it because then that would

114
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:24,000
violate regulations and basically screw up
the utility token classification. But

115
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:31,000
that's obviously doable. You can bridge
the tokens through Rosen Bridge and use

116
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:38,000
them on Ergo as well. So if you want
RS-POM on Ergo, you have the ability to do

117
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:45,000
that. All right, but so what do you need
sort of like staking context? So for

118
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:52,000
basically we need to have staking support,
so we have dynamic staking. MGPi and Luca

119
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:59,000
developed it for Cardano and for EVM
because that's our two main token holder

120
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:06,000
groups are mostly Cardano and some EVM on
BNB. And so, like I said, that's what

121
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:13,000
we're using Rosen Bridge for is to be able
to move back and forth between these two

122
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:20,000
ecosystems. Like I said, for us to be able
to support Ergo officially, we would need

123
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:27,000
to have staking on Ergo or else it could
actually be classified as security on

124
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Ergo. So that's what we need. We need to
have staking support for staking on Ergo

125
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:41,000
before we can spin up any kind of
liquidity pools on Ergo. I was researching

126
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:48,000
this today because like I said, Mew, I was
talking to Mew about this and I talked to

127
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Sam about this. And yeah, that looks like
for us to be able to do that, that's what

128
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:02,000
we need to do. And like I said, it's in a
pipeline, but it's not gonna be available

129
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:09,000
at launch on the 14th, unfortunately, but
we'll get it going. Oh, I see.

130
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
But staking, so before Ergopad guys and
Paideia, well, did staking contracts, so

131
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,000
maybe you can talk with Louis about it.

132
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:32,000
There is something that we can
potentially do. I'm not sure because also,

133
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:39,000
yeah, we, Louis Wattray is also working
with us. You know, we're kind of like the,

134
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:46,000
we take all your best Ergo peeps and get
them to work for us. Haha. So Louis

135
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Wattray is also working on smart contracts
with us. So maybe potentially it's

136
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:00,000
something that he can look into because he
also worked on Paideia, right? He, or he

137
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:07,000
still is working on Paideia. I know that
qx() knows all about that. Is he working

138
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:14,000
on Paideia QX? What happened to you? You
sound really distant.

139
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Louie.

140
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Louie, yeah, yeah. We need Marty to work
on the front end of Paideia as well.

141
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Marty, if you're watching this at some
point, fix the front end of Paideia,

142
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
please. Thank you.

143
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Well, okay. But I'm saying, you know,
just right now, thinking about my own

144
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:43,000
project, I need to have staking support on
Ergo for me to do that.

145
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Yeah, you got it. You got it with
Paideia. You've got the tech there with

146
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
the Ergopad. It's all there. You just got
to put it together, Dan.

147
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Yeah, so yes, it's not, like I said, it's
on the roadmap. It's just like I said,

148
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:01,000
it's not going to be available on the
14th. So you would have to, if you want to

149
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:07,000
be able to do stuff with Palm, if you want
to stake with Palm, use Rosen to either go

150
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:13,000
to Cardano or to EVM depending on what you
want to play with. If you want to play

151
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:19,000
with both, play with both. I'm actually
really excited about this because I think

152
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:25,000
this is going to be... Well, I know it is
going to be the first official launch, a

153
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:31,000
multi-chain launch using Rosen, and I
would really like to see what it looks

154
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:37,000
like in action because that's actually
going to bring... We are lining everything

155
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:43,000
up to make sure that there is going to be
a bunch of trading arbitrage between the

156
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:49,000
two chains. And so it would be really
interesting to see how Rosen stands up to

157
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:55,000
real-time arbitrage. I think it'll do
well. we're betting on it. We're invested

158
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:01,000
in that decision, but I think it'll
actually do well, and I think that'll

159
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:07,000
actually kind of give other projects a
nice preview, I don't know why I said it

160
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:13,000
weird, preview of how you can do a
cross-chain launch using Ergo tech. It's

161
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:19,000
pretty exciting to me. And like I said, I
would really like to see how it all works

162
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:25,000
out next week.

163
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Yeah. Well, we've seen in practice or in
examples, arbitrage happening between

164
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Cardano and Ergo simply with, Rosen, Rosen
ERG. So, and, and, and Rosen Bridge. So

165
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,000
yeah, it seems to work well, at least, you
know, you'll, you'll notice that during

166
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,000
times of pumps, a lot of arbitrage is
happening back and forth between the two.

167
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,000
So yeah, cool. That'll be neat.

168
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Yeah. Oh, actually I got a, I got a
question, from, Luke, a Gray Smith. So

169
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:06,000
then if you buy a bunch of Palm tokens on
Cardano using Ada, do you lose my, do I

170
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:12,000
lose my Cardano voting power? I mean,
yeah, because I think Cardano, you can

171
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:18,000
only vote with, with, with Cardano. I
don't think they have like, what, what is

172
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:24,000
it? I mean, actually, I talked to Charles
about this a while back, but I don't think

173
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:30,000
there's anything like Babel voting support
or anything on Cardano just yet. It would

174
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:36,000
be interesting if there was. It would be
pretty cool if there was. But I don't

175
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:42,000
think there is Babel. I guess that what
you would call it, what would you call

176
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,000
something like that if you're voting with
native assets? Proxy tokens, I guess.

177
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Proxy, OK, yeah. I don't think they have
anything like that on Cardano yet, but

178
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:00,000
hopefully that's something that's going to
be in the pipeline. And like I said,

179
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,000
actually, I talked to Charles about this.
Couple of years ago, I think. It's been a

180
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:12,000
few years since I talked to him, and he
did think that that's actually something

181
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:18,000
that's been really interesting, but I
think it's just a matter of priorities of

182
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:24,000
what they want to deploy now versus down
the line. Yeah, so the answer is yes, you

183
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:30,000
would. I would imagine lose voting power,
but you would gain voting power and

184
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:36,000
participation power in the Palm economy in
a Palmyra ecosystem where you can actually

185
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:42,000
use those tokens for the Palm DAO, which
is going to be its own ecosystem. And

186
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:48,000
that's also something that we're going to
be launching. And actually, potentially,

187
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:54,000
once we bridge it, we'll also bridge it
over to Ergo. We're most likely going to

188
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:00,000
be using the Paideia infrastructure for
that for the DAO.

189
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,000
The ADA that you sell Palm for, it goes
into some sort of treasury, regardless of

190
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:16,000
whether you spend it or save it. You could
do some sort of percentage voting power

191
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,000
there because if, let's say, you poll
daily the amount of Palm holders on

192
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Cardano that have purchased with ADA and
directly into the treasury or the

193
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,000
liquidity pool. You could then, use that
ADA. Oh, well, this is, I guess this is

194
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,000
only for ICOs, right? If you actually hold
the ADA anymore, but if you hold the ADA,

195
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,000
you could offer a percentage of voting to
Rosen Palm holders and Palm holders and

196
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,000
you guys vote yourselves according to
their plans, depending if you have that

197
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,000
DAO infrastructure.

198
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Now we kind of make us see, I mean, that
essentially would make a DRAP on us.

199
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Yeah, exactly. Yep. I mean, that's, yeah,
but the thing is, DRAPs are delegating

200
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:11,000
their ADA. So, like, I don't actually, you
know, the DRAP, or people are delegating

201
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:17,000
their ADA to DRAPs like they do with
staking. So, you don't actually let the

202
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:23,000
DRAP custody the ADA. But if we're
custodying the ADA, then we, like, I mean,

203
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:29,000
theoretically, we can be our own DRAP, but
that's kind of, you know, well, first of

204
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:35,000
all, it's a bit moot because you know, you
got de-reps with that, you know, have way,

205
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:41,000
way more voting power than, you know, than
we would if we custody or if we did

206
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:47,000
de-repping with the ADA that we hold. And
also, you know, that ADA is being used for

207
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:53,000
other things. So it's like, you know, it's
kind of a...

208
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Yeah, I'm just saying it could be an
attractive alternative to saying, hey, you

209
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
buy Palm, you can still vote. You can
still have some voting power on the

210
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Cardano ecosystem.

211
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
It is possible, but I would actually
would like to see some sort of like proxy

212
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
token support for that, because I think
that would actually make it a lot more

213
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,000
interesting for people who are investing
in native assets in both Cardano and Ergo,

214
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
because with Ergo, if you have native
asset support for voting, then you could

215
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
potentially use Rosen to bridge some
assets back and forth between Cardano and

216
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Ergo. So you can use like Ergo tokens and
make them into RS whatever on the other

217
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
side. You can use RS ERG on the Cardano
side for voting. That would be kind of

218
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,000
cool, I think.

219
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Yeah. I mean, the tricky part is locking
up the ADA that you purchase that proxy

220
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
token with, right? Otherwise, it's double
voting rights at some point and you're

221
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
diluting the voting pool.

222
00:21:51,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Yeah, yeah. And, and, and, and you may,
it tells me to, whatever that means.

223
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I think you, I think you know what it
means then.

224
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I, well, that that's actually, you know,
our head of business development in

225
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Argentina, his name is Facundo Ramirez,
and his nickname is Kufa, but sometimes

226
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:21,000
it's FAKU. So he might be talking about
Facundo. I don't know. That's a

227
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:27,000
possibility. So maybe he's just saying
shout out to Kufa. So yeah, Jume, if it is

228
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:33,000
a shout out to Kufa, then shout out to
Kufa. If not, then I'm going to talk to

229
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:39,000
the CIA about this and you know what I
mean.

230
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Oh, he knows what you mean. kushti, you
got node 6.0 RC4 out successfully on

231
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,000
mainnet, no errors, fully synced. And you
were saying something like, you had a

232
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:56,000
tweet the other day that said that you
know of none of these infrastructure

233
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,000
upgrades have ever broken the chain,
unlike other.

234
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Yeah, but for RC4, you need to understand
that probably this version would be broken

235
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:20,000
after RC5, and RC5 would be identical to
the final release. There are some fixes

236
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:29,000
still needed to be included. So two pull
requests now under review, so once

237
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:38,000
approved and merged, RC5 will be released
and yeah, that's basically the final

238
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:47,000
version of 6.0. So, yeah, RC4 is not
stable release, still, right, but you can

239
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:56,000
sync the mainnet with it, at least. And,
yeah, well... To the best of my knowledge,

240
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:05,000
no any applications were broken due to
protocol upgrades. That's kind of

241
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:14,000
philosophy here, I guess, the non-breaking
development process. Application

242
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:23,000
developers may be confident that what
they're building will stay. The ecosystem

243
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:32,000
could be built as a kind of I don't know,
like a medieval cathedral, right? So

244
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:41,000
people built them for centuries and well,
still they're around us and yeah, well,

245
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:50,000
very solid constructions after all. So,
yeah, well, the idea here is to have a

246
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:59,000
good foundation for building digital
financial cathedrals, like solid

247
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:08,000
constructions. And non-breaking protocol,
core protocol development is absolutely

248
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:17,000
crucial here.

249
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Yeah, I'm looking at the node list,
kushti, and I still see there's nodes on

250
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:30,000
stuff as old as 5.0.9, for goodness sake,
back there in the active node list, 5.0.8.

251
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:35,000
And they're still trucking along, no
problem.

252
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Oh, that's okay. So you can use even
4.0.100, right? Something like that. But

253
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:53,000
what I was talking about is applications,
so if you have some application done in

254
00:25:53,000 --> 00:26:02,000
ErgoScript back in 2019, right deployed on
the blockchain around that time you can

255
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:11,000
use well it's right now so all the boxes
are spendable and exactly in the same way

256
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:20,000
as six years ago. And yeah, well, there
are more exciting things. So now we have

257
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:29,000
finally, Merkleized Sub-Syntax trees and
Merkleized Finite State Machines, examples

258
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:38,000
done in ErgoScript. And they're allowing
for a lot of cool things, like you may

259
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:47,000
have a wallet which is controlled by one
of, let's say, 100 policies, right? So you

260
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:56,000
may specify well, 10 or 100 different
spending conditions and instead of some

261
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:05,000
huge script, so you are just including
hash, Merkle tree root hash, right, and

262
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:14,000
well, policies are written under this tree
and then you present script, you're

263
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:23,000
executing during spending and while
proving execution of it so yeah that would

264
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:32,000
be helpful for some complex wallet
scenarios like Bybit, for example, right,

265
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:41,000
that's a recent scenario when hackers are
able to drain the wallets, right, so you

266
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:50,000
may have like different spending policies
protecting a big wallet like Bybit, right,

267
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:59,000
and well, to avoid, well, big scripts and
to avoid showing all the logic actually

268
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:08,000
also, so to have somewhat privacy, you may
use this Merkleized solution for storing a

269
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:17,000
lot of policies in a compact way. Well,
with Merkleized Finite State Machine, you

270
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:26,000
may have multi-stage contract execution
with states, well, been progressing right

271
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:35,000
from one state to another and when the
contract is reaching final state, well,

272
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:44,000
the UTXO is becoming spendable so yeah
it's even more powerful construction so

273
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:53,000
yeah may be useful in different contexts
and also to have some privacy so for

274
00:28:53,000 --> 00:29:02,000
example if you have some disputes in your
contract some dispute path then yeah you

275
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:11,000
need to show it only during the dispute
right otherwise if some escrow for example

276
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:20,000
is used in a dispute process so well the
identity of an escrow agent is hidden

277
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:29,000
right before the dispute starts and so on
so yeah a lot of possibilities and well

278
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:38,000
contracts were done back in 2018 but yeah
now are they available in ErgoScript form

279
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:47,000
so yeah you may check so a lot so of new
possibilities for ErgoScript developers,

280
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:56,000
which were available on a low level
before. And also for sub-blocks, so I'm

281
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:05,000
already doing initial tests of multi-peer
network. Well, actually I have two peers,

282
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:14,000
one on my laptop, another is on server.
So, well, I'm also doing debugging of

283
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:23,000
both.

284
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Is this what you called for the other day
where you want somebody to help you run a

285
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
DevNet, kushti?

286
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Yeah, so for now, well, it's better for
me to have, well, just two nodes of mine,

287
00:30:52,000 --> 00:31:02,000
both in debug session, right? So I'm doing
debugging of both nodes in parallel to see

288
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:12,000
how the peer layer is working. And then,
yeah, well, after some time it would be

289
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:22,000
good to have more peers with mining. So,
well, I'm doing CPU mining on both peers.

290
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:32,000
So, yeah, well, CPU mining is enough.
Well, also for Dexy we have found people

291
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:42,000
willing to hold update keys for the
initial periods and also we considered

292
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:52,000
bootstrapping. So, yeah, well, everything
is set for launch. May not launch. Then we

293
00:31:52,000 --> 00:32:02,000
may proceed.

294
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Dan, can you click on Ursa Miner's
question? It's a good segue into this.

295
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Let's see.

296
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Ursa Miner says, please explain how
oracles are safe from hacks or gaming of

297
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:19,000
price feeds like LBMA or Shanghai index.

298
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Do you want to take that one or you want
me to take it or what do you want to do?

299
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Well, I'm sorry, kushti can take it or I
can take it. That's fine. Either one.

300
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Well, I mean, I can talk about this
because actually this is something also

301
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:40,000
that we're going to be building out for
Lithos. I can chime in on this because

302
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Ursa Miner is talking about LBMA. LBMA is
a commodities gold standard. LBMA gold is

303
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:52,000
the standard for commodity trading for
gold. It has specific purity. It's 99.8, I

304
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:58,000
think. That's basically what makes it
uniform. If you have LBMA gold, then it

305
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:04,000
doesn't matter where the gold comes from.
Now, the problem here is that with gold,

306
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:10,000
it happens with, you know, with others
like lithium, it also happens where there

307
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:16,000
is price manipulation happening, right?
And so you have, well, so with gold, you

308
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:22,000
actually have more even price reporting
because there's a lot of places that

309
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:28,000
report the price. But with something like
lithium, you don't have enough places that

310
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:34,000
you have a uniform reporting standard.
What you have is you have these

311
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:40,000
disparities in price, which can then be
manipulated by producers that want to make

312
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:46,000
the price go up. Say there's some
producers in some Latam countries that

313
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:52,000
will stop producing lithium to make the
price go up. Even though they can't

314
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:58,000
produce it, they feel like they want to
make more money, so they just stop

315
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:04,000
producing it and increase demand. It's not
easy to do that with gold because there

316
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:10,000
are just too many, right? But essentially
what happens is even if you have a bunch

317
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:16,000
of reporting places, most of the time it's
actually, it's not a lot of small

318
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:22,000
companies that are doing it, right? It's a
lot, you know, most of it is just like a

319
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:28,000
handful of large companies and large
producers that are doing the reporting and

320
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:34,000
that are setting the prices. And even if
you have smaller producers for gold, like

321
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:40,000
for example in Thailand, they have their
own standard. But in Thailand, even though

322
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:46,000
you have a bunch of small producers, they
all are part of this like gold consortium

323
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:52,000
that will then set the price for that day.
And so again, even though you have, you

324
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:58,000
know, not decentralization, but
distribution, like a distributed consensus

325
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:04,000
for price discovery, you essentially only
have one central entity that will decide

326
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:10,000
what the price is, and then it will report
it up to the oracle or report it up to the

327
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:16,000
index. So that can be manipulated, because
even though you have distribution, you

328
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:22,000
always have the centralized points that
end up reporting, because not everybody

329
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:28,000
can report it. With the decentralized
oracle ecosystem, basically the more

330
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:34,000
oracles you spin up, number one, oracles
can be run without specific vetted

331
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:40,000
interests in keeping the price up or down.
Because if it's an effective oracle

332
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:46,000
system, it'll have its own incentive
structure that will incentivize the oracle

333
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:52,000
to produce proper data, right? So you
don't have data manipulation. That's

334
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:58,000
number one. So it's not reliant on the
incentive of the price going up or down.

335
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:04,000
It's reliant on doing your job because
there's an incentive structure built into

336
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:10,000
the oracle network of rewards and slashing
or whatever, however your network is

337
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:16,000
built. That's number one. Number two,
anybody can spin it up if it is

338
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:22,000
decentralized oracle network. So you don't
have to be like a gold consortium to spin

339
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:28,000
up a gold oracle, a gold price oracle. You
just have to have the hardware, and you

340
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:34,000
have to be able to participate within the
financial structure that extrudes these

341
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:40,000
rewards. And so that's a lot harder to
manipulate, just like any decentralized

342
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:46,000
consensus is, because it's a decentralized
consensus, right? So you always will have

343
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:52,000
a minimum, like a minimum consensus for
something, you know, for price or

344
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:58,000
whatever, right? So even if like, say, I
wanna manipulate it and I start up my own

345
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:04,000
oracle and I start giving out shit data,
it's still, you know, you still can't

346
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:10,000
convince everybody to give out shit data.
It's really difficult. Like it is with

347
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:16,000
these distributed consensus, with the
centralized consensus or, you know, public

348
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:22,000
ledgers. So, I mean, that's essentially
like, that's what the I think that's what

349
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:28,000
makes it makes it different, right?
Because even with the big indexes, the

350
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:34,000
information still comes from centralized
sources that have a vetted interest in the

351
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:40,000
price doing whatever it's doing versus an
oracle network as interest in channeling

352
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:46,000
proper data because their incentive is to
get rewards and not get slashed by the

353
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:52,000
oracle incentives. And if you do have some
adversarial players in the network,

354
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:58,000
chances are really good that you can get
enough non-adversarial players in the

355
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:04,000
network that would just want to
participate in the network and not try to

356
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:10,000
manipulate the price. And so that you can
then mitigate price manipulation or data

357
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:16,000
manipulation from adversarial parties. So
I mean, that's how I see it working. I

358
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:22,000
don't know what you guys think about that.

359
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Yeah, not bad, Dan. I'm impressed. Good
job. Yeah, so like you said, it's only, I

360
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:40,000
mean, the data we're bringing on chain
with oracles is only as good as the data

361
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:45,000
that's out there, right? So there could be
manipulation probably sooner on the

362
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:50,000
outside world than there is coming into
the chain. With Dexy, we have, what is it,

363
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:55,000
15 kushti right now with gold oracle.

364
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Something like that.
Yeah, hotline.

365
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Yeah, so right now, the only thing you
can slash on that is your participation

366
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:12,000
token. There's not a vested interest in
that, not a vested amount of money that

367
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:17,000
can slash, kind of like the Rosen guards
would be. But there is the incentive that

368
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:22,000
if I screw up or start reporting falsely
or get a bribe from somebody on the

369
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:27,000
outside, I'm going to cut off any sort of
income that I'd be getting from the gold

370
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:32,000
oracle token for the forever, you know
what I mean? It'd be done. I'd be an

371
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:37,000
untouchable, don't touch, blacklisted kind
of thing. So yeah, there's that incentive

372
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:42,000
to be a good actor there. And I do think
you're right, Dan. I think in these

373
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:47,000
circumstances, especially in the Ergo
ecosystem, you're going to have a larger

374
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:52,000
group of actors naturally that want to do
well and do good and continue a good

375
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:57,000
service. Yeah.

376
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Well, in oracle pools, if you're
providing outlier data, then your data

377
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:15,000
point is just excluded, right? And for the
rest, which is calculated, posted on the

378
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:24,000
chain. Then you need to convince the
majority of oracles, right? to post some

379
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:33,000
invalid data but yeah well as HQ said and
some other comment about that so yeah well

380
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:42,000
after all oracles well just passing data,
right? Pulling data right from outside and

381
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:51,000
yeah, there is not much you can do with
outside. Well, so you may pull from

382
00:40:51,000 --> 00:41:00,000
different source and do everything.
Average it out, yeah. Yeah, you can do

383
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:09,000
your own data provider. So for USD, well,
it's CoinGecko by default. And here, well,

384
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:18,000
I made my own provider once and here
posted data from a different source and so

385
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:27,000
on but yeah after all so well in most
cases oracles are well not not forming

386
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:36,000
data right so they're just pulling the
data from some source. And then, yeah,

387
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:45,000
well, it's interesting in regards with
lithium to use actual producers or market

388
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:54,000
participants as data providers. That would
be quite interesting.

389
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Yeah, that's actually something that I
started working with my business

390
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:13,000
development team on right now is actually
contacting market participants and

391
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:19,000
producers to work with us in delivering
this data so that there could actually be

392
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:25,000
arbitrage opportunities for different
regions for lithium, because right now a

393
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:31,000
lot of it is actually kind of fragmented,
right? So you've got different prices

394
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:37,000
coming out of different regions. You also
have another problem, which is logistics,

395
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:43,000
right? This is actually not just for
lithium. One of the biggest issues

396
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:49,000
commodities face is a problem with
logistics. For example, in the case of

397
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Argentinian lithium, one of the main
problems that Argentinian companies have

398
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:01,000
right now that have access to the lithium.
Even if they have land that has lithium

399
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:07,000
deposits and they want to spin up an
operation, it's not just about spinning up

400
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:13,000
an operation that will then process the
lithium brine and then extract lithium out

401
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:19,000
of it, but it's also about getting it out
of there. The customer's not going to come

402
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:25,000
to you. You have to ship it to them. What
you have to remember is that most of this

403
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:31,000
stuff happens in high elevations. Some of
you saw the, yeah, a lot higher than that

404
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:37,000
QX. Yeah, way higher than that, way
higher. If maybe some of you saw that the

405
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:43,000
documentary we came up with, The Lithium
Must Flow, we're at, I forgot what it was,

406
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:49,000
but it was like 10,000 or 15,000 meters up
or something. It was basically where if

407
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:55,000
you are not a fit person, don't run,
because your lungs will burn. And I mean,

408
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:01,000
I am semi-fit-ish. I do exercise. And even
I made the mistake of thinking that I was

409
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:07,000
more fit than I am. And I forgot that I'm
middle-aged. And I try to climb up a dune.

410
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:13,000
And then my lungs said, no, fuck off. and
then just burned a long time. So don't do

411
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:19,000
that. So point is that when you get up to
these elevations, you get logistics

412
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:25,000
problems. So just in the case of lithium,
lithium deposits are at high elevations

413
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:31,000
and they're in these remote areas. And so
you have to be able to get it out of

414
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:37,000
there. And so what happens is some
companies, like say the Chinese companies,

415
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:43,000
they'll come in there and actually ship
all of their logistics providers as well.

416
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:49,000
They'll take all their trucks over there.
They'll take all the drivers and

417
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:55,000
everybody. So they'll ship the entire kit,
not just start the facility in the higher

418
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:01,000
locally, but ship everything over there.
Everybody's gonna be Chinese, right?

419
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Everybody down to the drivers is gonna be
Chinese. The trucks are gonna be Chinese,

420
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:13,000
like all this stuff. And so, yeah, so
basically what you get is a problem in

421
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:19,000
logistics, which then has a, which then
creates a problem for delivery, which then

422
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:25,000
creates a problem for equal price
sustainability. And so, and so that's what

423
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:31,000
happens, you know, with, and then it can
also happen with gold as well. You know,

424
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:37,000
there's some areas, say like in Africa,
for example, that are gold rich, but you

425
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:43,000
can actually cannot get the gold out
easily. And that is why, you know, they'll

426
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:49,000
be sitting on gold deposits, but like
getting those gold deposits out of there

427
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:55,000
might be a problem. And therefore they
can't really do much with it. And they

428
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:01,000
have to, you know, have to rely on outside
means or lowering the price or whatever

429
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:07,000
else. So, yes, so basically, actually, to
get back to the original question here,

430
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:13,000
right, so the question here is the
question that was asked here is, are we

431
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:19,000
relying on centralized sources like
CoinGecko? Yeah, and in the case of

432
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:25,000
commodities, a lot of times you have to do
the same thing because there are just not

433
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:31,000
enough sources out there that, I mean,
like, say, for example, what Alex said,

434
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:37,000
you have to create his own pricing index
to be able to pull data so you wouldn't

435
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:43,000
have to use CoinGecko. So most of these
oracles will just pull stuff out of

436
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:49,000
CoinGecko, they'll pull stuff out of
CoinMarketCap or a couple of other ones.

437
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:55,000
So it kind of defeats the purpose. Well,
it's like, well, yes, basically just kind

438
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:01,000
of like a proxy for an API at that point.
You're not really a pricing oracle. But in

439
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:07,000
a real pricing oracle scenario, what you
actually want to have is that variety. And

440
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:13,000
it could also be part of the protocol.
Like, for example, only a certain amount

441
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:19,000
of oracles can report prices from these
particular places. You know, there should

442
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:25,000
be, there should be oracles that report
prices from like, you should see, you can

443
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:31,000
set your, your, your minimum threshold
for, oracles reporting prices outside of

444
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:37,000
these, you know, the CoinGeckos and the
more CoinMarketCaps, you know, just all

445
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:43,000
depends on that. But, but really, yeah,
just all about kind of getting a variety

446
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:49,000
of data and in commodities as well. You
want to have producers reporting because

447
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:55,000
you will get a variety of data out. And of
course, there's going to be some data

448
00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:01,000
bullshit going on there, but you can have
number one, an incentive structure to

449
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:07,000
mitigate that, and number two, a
mitigation protocol to an algorithm that

450
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:13,000
will counteract that kind of behavior. So
there's several different things you can

451
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:19,000
do if you get enough data. Because if you
don't have enough data variety, then

452
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:25,000
there's only so much you can do.

453
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Yeah, that's going to be interesting,
Dan, because people need to remember that

454
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:35,000
these oracles don't just exist for Palmyra
or Palmyra, right? These are going to be

455
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:39,000
on chain in public to everybody. So there
could be competing oracles, right? Your

456
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:43,000
oracles, Dan, that you've helped perhaps
set up with lithium could be more of an

457
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:47,000
average pricing than somebody setting up
oracles pulling on-chain data from other

458
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:51,000
lithium price providers that maybe is a
little faster to adjust price or rides a

459
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:55,000
little higher. So then it's up to the
dApps to decide which oracles they're

460
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:59,000
going to price from from there. So there's
actually a competition among oracle

461
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:03,000
providers, even though they're
decentralized and open source at that

462
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:07,000
point, which is interesting thought. Cool.
We got another question here before we go.

463
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Yeah, sorry, go for it.

464
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Yeah, so there is more here. So for USD,
for example, well, if you are not using

465
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:33,000
CoinGecko or CoinMarketCap, then you are
using some exchange probably directly,

466
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:40,000
right? And then you need for enough
volume. So what CoinGecko is doing, for

467
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:47,000
example, already is averaging data, doing
weighted average from different exchanges,

468
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:54,000
it's already improving quality of data,
three to five at least. And then yeah well

469
00:49:54,000 --> 00:50:01,000
for the lithium use case well if producers
are going to put data on chain it would be

470
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:08,000
quite interesting actually case where we
can create some alternative price index

471
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:15,000
right maybe also secured with some
on-chain protocols and so well

472
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:22,000
transparency which would be quite
interesting because well for existing

473
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:29,000
price it's not quite clear right well how
they formed and what manipulations there

474
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:36,000
probably it's not even possible to

475
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Well, there is manipulation. It mostly
comes from certain Asian countries. And

476
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:50,000
it's a problem because it literally...
First of all, it creates an opportunity

477
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:57,000
for more manipulation. It basically feeds
itself. It also stifles real business

478
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:04,000
because some of these guys just can't
really do honest business because there's

479
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:11,000
manipulation. Yeah, it's a problem.

480
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Yeah, looking at CoinGecko, guys, there's
at least a top 15 are considered somewhat

481
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:25,000
trustworthy of their combined score or
their combined price for Ergo. Spectrum

482
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Finance or ErgoDEX is 16, and it looks
like they're getting prices from that as

483
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:35,000
well. Yeah, so it's getting from DEX, it's
getting from CEXs for the CoinGecko price.

484
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:40,000
But yeah, I would say that is an issue
that for the oracle 2 is not going to do

485
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:45,000
is that we're getting it from one source
that aggregates other sources. It'd be

486
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:50,000
nice to aggregate the sources ourselves
inside the oracle protocol so that if one

487
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:55,000
thing goes down, it doesn't matter. We
still have 16 other sources that we're

488
00:51:55,000 --> 00:52:00,000
pulling an average again and weighting and
kind of thing. So yeah. Cool. Well, it's

489
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:05,000
10 o'clock, boys. I've got in real life
meetings. I got a hit.

490
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:08,000
You don't have any meetings. You just
have to... I'm not important. I'm not

491
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,000
important at all. You have to go and stare
at the wall again. Come on, you're working

492
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,000
for them. What do you guys do there
anyway?

493
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:20,000
All right. All right. And Sigmanauts, I
will be around, I don't know, on Saturday

494
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:26,000
or Sunday, my evening. So let's have some
community chats over the Telegram, just

495
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:32,000
text chat maybe about high-performance
proof-of-work protocols, sub-blocks, all

496
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:38,000
that stuff. So yeah, I'll see you around.
Awesome. Yeah, bye.

497
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:47,000
All right, everybody. Thanks for tuning
in. And yeah, next week, same time, same

498
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:53,000
place, same channel on YouTube. And until
then, this is Dan coming to you live from

499
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:59,000
Japan. Still have a bunch of work to do,
by the way. It's only 11 p.m. All right.

500
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:05,000
And to the sides here, I got, well, I got
QX and I got kushti. It looks all just all

501
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:11,000
wrong. Anyway, thanks. Thanks for leaving
us off on that QX. All right, we're gonna

502
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:17,000
sign off. See everybody. See you later
buddy.
