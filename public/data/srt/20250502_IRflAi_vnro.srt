1
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Hey.

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Good morning, kushti.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
How are you doing?

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Doing well, doing well.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
How about you?

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Good, good, good.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
A little sleepy, a little sleepy, but
hanging in there.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
How's your week been?

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
So it's busy, super busy.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:41,000
So yeah, just today had a call actually
with some guys from African government

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:50,000
about tokenizing real world assets like
minerals they're producing with the main

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:59,000
idea to find also funding model for local
small and medium-sized cooperatives, well

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:08,000
entities doing mining right. So well it's
a huge problem it seems so yeah well let's

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:17,000
see how it goes but having a lot of talks
these days about well possibility to build

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:26,000
this and that.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:39,000
So a lot of folks are currently in Dubai.
It's Token 2049, but yeah, I have enough

17
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:48,000
connections. So there is no need to waste
time on those big events. So yeah, busy

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:57,000
with, well, talking a lot despite skipping
those events.

19
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
So, yeah, well, maybe we'll provide more
details, but then you need to finalize

20
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,000
some talks and well also started talking
developers community. We had quite good

21
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
developers chat yesterday so the talk is
about what to do after sub-blocks right.

22
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
So well what do we have currently right so
we have five - no five - oh 5.0.26 which

23
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,000
is under review and well it will be
released first I believe and it will help

24
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
with user experience little bit by
supporting block candidate regeneration

25
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,000
finally.

26
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Then yeah well 6.0 is finalized, well
it's quite huge update so it's about 16-17

27
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:04,000
thousand lines of code. Yeah so well it's
under review right for some time and yet

28
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:13,000
it is still under review right so that
there were some issues found, fixed, so

29
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:22,000
now it's hopefully finalized but yeah well
still hope that there is some audit going

30
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:31,000
on.

31
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:41,000
But, yeah, well, we can start reaching
pool, mining pools anyways, and fix voting

32
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:48,000
height, right, to start voting. And then,
well, in case of successful voting, in

33
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:55,000
case of super majority, 90% actually
support, well, we will have activation in

34
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:02,000
three months.

35
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Right, and then for sub-blocks, well,
I've done recently peer-to-peer layer, so

36
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:18,000
new peer-to-peer layer messages. Well,
proper validation of sub-blocks, right,

37
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:26,000
because, well, certain transactions cannot
be included in sub-blocks, for example,

38
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:34,000
emission, right, transaction and other
transactions which depend on block

39
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:42,000
timestamp and miners public key.

40
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Right because well they are changing from
one sub-block to another so then yeah well

41
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:01,000
if for soft fork, right, then such
transactions cannot be included into a

42
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:09,000
sub-block because, well, all the clients
would receive just full blocks, so they

43
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:17,000
are doing now, right, and, well, the
transaction could become invalid, right,

44
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:25,000
in well-filled clients, but being valid
for new clients. Otherwise, I mean, if

45
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:33,000
we're allowed for inclusion of such
transactions.

46
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:44,000
So, well, this is fixed now, right? So
there is proper validation of sub-block

47
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:52,000
transactions. And well, like 99.9%
transactions can be included and will be

48
00:05:52,000 --> 00:06:00,000
included in sub-blocks. Right, so well,
now I'm...

49
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I believe block candidate generation is
also done, so what's needed now is to

50
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:15,000
rework peer-to-peer layer a little bit to
send full blocks to old clients on

51
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:22,000
generating a block. Not a sub-block,
right. And, well, to send only, well,

52
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:29,000
basically difference to new clients,
right? Supporting sub-blocks to avoid

53
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:36,000
setting, well, full blocks on their mind.

54
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,000
How old can you go there, kushti? How old
can a client be?

55
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:53,000
So all the clients before sub-blocks
would be supported, right? Everything.

56
00:06:53,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Yeah, so after sub-blocks deployment,
yeah, even 4.0 would be supported.

57
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Wow, that's impressive.

58
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:13,000
We are quite extreme here, right, about
support. So, well, in next version 7.0

59
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:22,000
right if it will be released there will be
probably some breaking changes for clients

60
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:31,000
before 5.0.23 or 24 so it's documented in
the release notes so but this is about the

61
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:40,000
next update right so 7.0 so it will be I
don't know in one or two years if it would

62
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:49,000
be needed at all in the first place.

63
00:07:53,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Currently, what was the point of the
developer's chat in particular, I started

64
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:13,000
with that, is to discuss what would be in
focus in regards with core development

65
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:23,000
after sub-blocks, right? But yeah, well if
there is no any concrete needs then maybe

66
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:33,000
in the first place and it seems well for
developers, ecosystem developers it's the

67
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:43,000
same based on feedback so it seems the
main thing needed is well improving

68
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:53,000
developing experience right and targeting
well real world needs I believe right

69
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:03,000
because well it's the time we are living
in when it's not a toy in a sandbox right

70
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:13,000
anymore so well it should be time right
now for beginning of transformation of

71
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:23,000
financial tooling well on scale right.

72
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
We've got MGPai joining us. He'll be
patched in in one minute. There he is.

73
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Welcome MGPai.

74
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Hey guys.

75
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Good to see you sir.

76
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Nice to be here.

77
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:53,000
So it's the moment when we have
cryptocurrencies going into corporate and

78
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:04,000
national reserves. At the same time,
tokenization of real-world assets. Well, I

79
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:15,000
see a new wave of demands for privacy, all
right and so on so and well that there is

80
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:26,000
even a particular interest in proof of
work again I believe right well in certain

81
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:37,000
circles it's a little bit strange because
yeah it's not about retail even often,

82
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:48,000
right? Well, it's the strange time where
most of retail is simply retarded, right?

83
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Well, an interesting proof of work, for
example, is coming from corporate

84
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:02,000
entities. Right, it's quite of reverse
what we had a few years ago, but well,

85
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:09,000
well, depending on the environment, our
principles are still the same, right?

86
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Yeah. Okay, so, and yeah, talking about
real-world adoption, so what's on your

87
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:23,000
side, what's new with the BRIC experiment?

88
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Also, it's really funny to watch people
are, as they recognize the way these kids

89
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
work is they always put, I don't want to
say they put everything off for the last

90
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
minute, but they prioritize, right? And
their priority is usually their work. So

91
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
if they don't have time to read
instructions or do anything, that's

92
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
usually the last minute. But the incentive
has been there long enough now for

93
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
students to recognize that their peers are
getting free things from handing and

94
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
recycle plots.

95
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,000
So if you do the equivalence, we've had a
ton of recycling and we've saved students

96
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,000
about $1,000 so far with utilizing Ergo
and the BRIC token. So the way it works is

97
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,000
students will bring in their plots after
they're done with them, stuff them in a

98
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,000
basket, and we say, OK, that's worth 40
BRIC or 50 BRIC or 60 BRIC. And we tip it

99
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,000
to them with Luivatra TipperBot.

100
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,000
And then the way my system works, I've
explained it before. When you send through

101
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
the interface to plot, it triggers a
pop-up in Discord channel that they just

102
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,000
copy the code to tip. They tip it. The
off-chain bot reads the wallet and then

103
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,000
marks the plot to be plotted kind of
thing. So it's a really simple setup using

104
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,000
the TipperBot and Ergo. And it's working
fantastically well. I don't think I've had

105
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,000
to bounce anything in the last four or
five months that I've been running it.

106
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
So it's been fantastic, except when
Luivatra's plot went down once. So

107
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
students now, some of the students are
trying to circumvent the rules a little

108
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
bit. Initially, I was like, okay, one plot
you bring back, it's 40 brick. But these

109
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
plots vary from 32 inches long to 160
inches wide. So what these kids, some of

110
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
these kids are doing is they're slicing
the plots into short pieces and rolling

111
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
them up and taping them to bring them to
recycle. So it looks like they have 10

112
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
plots, but in reality it's like three or
four.

113
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,000
So I've switched to the method of just
saying, yeah, the mass of that paper looks

114
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,000
like X amount of plots. So here's X amount
of bricks. So it's really funny how

115
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,000
they're trying to squeeze as much as they
can out of this kind of stuff. So the next

116
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,000
step as this gets more and more popular is
I'm going to approach the departments

117
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,000
themselves the architecture department and
say hey you know to show the students that

118
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,000
you're serious about recycling and reusing
why don't you sponsor some brick and give

119
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,000
us an injection of five thousand or ten
thousand dollars worth of brick and then

120
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,000
we will inject that into the students and
they will have free plotting from the

121
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,000
architecture department to encourage
recycling.

122
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Or it's a bonus thing. You bring your
plot back this week and then the

123
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
architecture department tacks on double
the amount of brick that you get for your

124
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
plots that you're bringing back this week.
So not only we're giving the word that the

125
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
architecture department is serious about
students recycling and reusing, but

126
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
they're also injecting funds in to help
out with this kind of thing. So it's

127
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
really fun. It's looking good.

128
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,000
And the students, we've got about 60, 70,
I believe, students that have set up

129
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,000
wallets and have been currently doing
those transactions. So that's about, what

130
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:42,000
do we have, about 350 architecture
students. So as I said, it's a slow burn,

131
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,000
but it rolls. And then it catches up and
it explodes. So it's cool. And especially

132
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,000
next semester, when we get more funds in
there, it'll be really fun.

133
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
But it's so cool to watch. I'm asking
kids like, some kids just show up with

134
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
like, I know they haven't recycled as much
and they're plotting like bam, bam, bam.

135
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
And I'm like, they must be trading in the
back. I didn't look, but they must be

136
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
trading in the background, something. So I
need to study the chain to see how that's

137
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
happening and how some people are ending
up with more brick than the other people.

138
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Cause they're not getting it from me.
That's for sure. So.

139
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Yeah, so maybe they're using brick as a
kind of currency.

140
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Yeah, exactly.

141
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Yeah, but that's when the real fun
starts, right? When people are starting to

142
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:40,000
use it to trade. And I think that that's
natural, especially when you are dealing

143
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:46,000
with students, right? So well, you, then,
may naturally expect attempts to cheat,

144
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:52,000
right?

145
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
And also, test the cage, you know, test
the wires if they're going to zap them or

146
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
not.

147
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Yeah. But also a lot of unplanned
activities, right? Including exciting

148
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
ones.

149
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Yeah. And it's nice to also use as, so we
hire about 20 student workers here to run

150
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,000
the center over there. And brick is really
like, typically at Cornell, you can't be

151
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,000
like, hey, good job. Here's 50 bucks extra
for your student work. That never happens.

152
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:28,000
But with Brick, we can say, hey, that was
awesome. Thanks for doing that. Here's 50

153
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,000
bricks towards your plotting. So it's this
bonus incentive structure that not only we

154
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,000
give to students, but we can give to our
student workers as a bonus for work well

155
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,000
done or extra things that they've done or
that kind of stuff. So that's a really,

156
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,000
really good tool to have in the tool chest
when you're doing that.

157
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:56,000
All right, and yeah, it would be
interesting to get information, right?

158
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:03,000
And, well, trading, I mean, if it happens,
but probably it does, right? If you see,

159
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:10,000
well, some secondary transactions, so not
generating from you. Then, yeah, it means

160
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:17,000
that there is some, well, economic
activity, right, exchange in this brick.

161
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:28,000
And well in regards with all those things
currently well I had a talk with HQx just

162
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:38,000
yesterday, so he was hit by this incident
in Spain, blackout, right? when there was

163
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:48,000
no electricity. So, yeah, well, the idea
he has is to do something with mesh

164
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:58,000
networks like, well, at least some catalog
of services, right, which you can access

165
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:08,000
when you don't have electricity for some
time.

166
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:20,000
But, yeah, well, then it's also possible,
so what I'm thinking about now is some

167
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:28,000
sort of off-chain currency, right, and we
also discussed that, backed by on-chain

168
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:36,000
reserves, right, so it's like ChainCash,
but with notes being created and

169
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:44,000
transferred our off-chain networks, such
as mesh networks or just, I don't know,

170
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:52,000
maybe the trusted server may track.

171
00:18:52,000 --> 00:19:00,000
But then you have reserves on blockchain
and the same reserve could be reused in

172
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:08,000
multiple networks. So it's kind of like
BitTorrent but for payments. So you have

173
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:16,000
some global layer with reserves which
serve the blockchain right and then yeah

174
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:24,000
very different currency systems off-chain
on top of it such as community currencies

175
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:32,000
well those mesh networks. Well, temporary
or not so payment solutions, maybe some

176
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:40,000
social media means of payments, right?

177
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:48,000
So, well, I'm also thinking about such
possibilities. So it's basically like a

178
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:56,000
tipper bot, right? We have a telegram. But
you can tip for content and not

179
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:04,000
necessarily with, well, money which do
exist, right, so you can first, I don't

180
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:12,000
know, give a star, right, to some content
or the internet and then pay, well, enough

181
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:20,000
debt to others collected, right, once a
month, maybe even, and then, yeah, well,

182
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:28,000
it's a good selfless payment to some
degree.

183
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,000
kushti, what about... What's the
possibility of... You're talking about

184
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,000
ChainCash and mesh networks with low
bandwidth. What's the possibility... I

185
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,000
know it's risky, right? What's the
possibility of integrating into a wallet

186
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,000
some sort of offline exchange so that if I
come to you and we meet up someplace

187
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,000
without any kind of internet wireless
signal, but you transfer me from wallet to

188
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,000
wallet and you sign a transaction
essentially to my wallet, I guess you

189
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:08,000
could spend it beforehand from another
wallet.

190
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,000
The thought is, if you can pre-sign
something and transfer it to my wallet,

191
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:20,000
then when I get internet, I can send it
out. But with UTXO, I guess you could

192
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,000
spend it from another wallet before that
transaction hits the pool. I guess there's

193
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:30,000
no way to do that without protecting the
asset offline?

194
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:37,000
So, if there is some trust, right? It had
to be trust, yeah, right. Yeah, you can do

195
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:43,000
some on-ramp. So, for example, you can get
state of on-chain reserve without even

196
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:49,000
having a network, well, without having it
right at the moment of a deal by just

197
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:55,000
checking NIPoPoWs proof corresponding to
the latest time of synchronization with

198
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:01,000
the network.

199
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:10,000
And then, yeah, well, you can see reserve
rights of a seller and during exchange you

200
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:18,000
are getting assigned notes and then, yeah,
you can present this note to a smart

201
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:26,000
contract when going online, right? But
then, yeah, well, if the seller is going,

202
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:34,000
so if you're buying, well, on-chain assets
this way, right? So then the seller may

203
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:42,000
appear before you on the chain and redeem,
right? So the reserve, so yeah, but then,

204
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:50,000
yeah, well, you may have some trust.

205
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,000
That's when you bring out the wrench
remedy on the seller.

206
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Right. So, well, if there is some, even a
low bandwidth access, right, then you can

207
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:07,000
have... Right. It doesn't take much. Yeah,
true. ...transactions. So, yeah, there are

208
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:13,000
lots of possibilities here. I mean, even
if there is some super limited access to

209
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:19,000
mobile network, like SMS access, right,
then yeah, it's possible to do a service

210
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:25,000
which is not relying on trust to the
seller, right? So you may have a trust

211
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:31,000
infrastructure provider, right? Which is,
well, providing SMS service basically, but

212
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:37,000
no more than that. Something like that.

213
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,000
If we need to have devices like really
real Ergo gold bricks where you put

214
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
stablecoin onto a ledger device that never
reveals its seed phrase to anybody, right?

215
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,000
So there's no way to extract the seed
phrase. So when you deliver these physical

216
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,000
devices, they know that there's no
extraction that could have been done to

217
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
it, and it can be redeemed without
somebody coming in behind you to the

218
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,000
internet first. I guess that'd be a little
risky, right, though, if it broke or

219
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,000
anything like that?

220
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. And it's also quite
experimental. It's called, in

221
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:30,000
cryptography, PUF, so physically
unclonable function. But yeah, so a device

222
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:37,000
which cannot be cloned. But yeah, I
actually don't know the current state of

223
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:44,000
this field. We need to check even.

224
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Cool. All right. Well, MGPai, how's,
how's your neck of the woods?

225
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Hey guys. I just been really busy on the
Cardano side of things, building over

226
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,000
there or, I'm sorry.

227
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
You're cutting out. We can't hear you at
all.

228
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:13,000
I'm just kidding. MGPai. He said Cardano.
So I said you were cutting out.

229
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Yeah, it's been very busy. We have
implemented staking for Zengi. I mean,

230
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:25,000
it's not just staking, it's very dynamic,
right? Because the rewards need to adjust

231
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:31,000
due to real world factors. So there's
several contracts working in conjunction

232
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:37,000
with each other to determine how much
rewards and how they get changed weekly.

233
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:43,000
So I've been working on that for a while.

234
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:52,000
So it's done. It's deployed to Cardano
and yet it's going quite well and a lot of

235
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:58,000
I think the contract hit like 1300
transactions and there's like 600 million

236
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Palm tokens which are like our Palm's Palm
economies tokens right it's locked so I

237
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:10,000
think that's worth like almost close to a
million dollars I don't know what the math

238
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:16,000
is but you know it's going quite well.

239
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:22,000
And I think it really showed me doing the
development on how things are in the state

240
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:28,000
of Cardano. And I frankly think it's not
that good compared to Ergo. The

241
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:34,000
development is just too over complicated.
It's UTXO already, right? So that of

242
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:40,000
course adds some layer of complexity that
most of Ergo developers are familiar with.

243
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:46,000
But then Cardano just goes the extra mile
to make it more difficult for you.

244
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,000
So the tooling is not really there. I
constantly need to go into libraries.

245
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Libraries are basically you borrow code
from other developers because you don't

246
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:05,000
want to reinvent the wheel. On Cardano, so
the assumption is, right, whatever you

247
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:10,000
borrow works when you use a library, when
you're coding. So on Cardano, you've got

248
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:15,000
to throw that assumption out of the
window.

249
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,000
And I constantly find issues in
libraries, and I have to go in them, and I

250
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,000
have to understand the library and fix
them. And whereas Ergo, you know, being

251
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,000
like what, like almost 100 times smaller,
or maybe like 10, 20 times smaller than

252
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Cardano has much better libraries. I don't
have to do that too often. I might need to

253
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,000
look into a library due to a lack of
documentation. But there's no really big

254
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,000
issue.

255
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:52,000
with the library and if there is an issue
it's quite easy to get the contact of the

256
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:58,000
contributors right on the developer
discord because you know everyone's just

257
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:04,000
so like close together right easy to reach
and you know they'll fix it like I think

258
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Anon_BR or yeah yeah he wrote the FleetSDK
library for Ergo. It's really, really well

259
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:16,000
done. He's an amazing, talented developer.
He's basically a solo developer who worked

260
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:22,000
on FleetSDK entirely.

261
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:35,000
and then Morphic who worked on AppKit.
They're really really robust libraries and

262
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:43,000
it's quite impressive what Ergo has
managed to do while being a fraction of

263
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:51,000
the size of Cardano. It's honestly quite
ridiculous Cardano being a multi-billion

264
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:59,000
dollar blockchain and then tooling just
you know being all over the place. Like

265
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:07,000
everyone has their own thing. Like there's
no unified Cardano entity.

266
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
There's no like a large library bank from
the Cardano foundation or IOHK or anything

267
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
like that that you have full access to,
kind of thing like that.

268
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Yeah, nothing like quite robust. I think
now Cardano, I'm not too sure, but Cardano

269
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:18,000
has like a serialization library that's
written, but you're written in Rust and C

270
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:23,000
and or C, I don't remember. I mean, you
don't use this because this is a really

271
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:28,000
low level tooling. So it's kind of like
SigmaRust on Ergo or how SigmaRust should

272
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:33,000
be on Ergo in the sense that it's a
library that other libraries use rather

273
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:38,000
than developers using it directly because
it's really low-level primitives.

274
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:49,000
But yeah, it's quite bad, but hopefully
they fix it. But I think the biggest thing

275
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:55,000
anyway for Ergo and Cardano both is to
improve this developer experience because

276
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:01,000
I also had to do stuff for EVM on Binance
Smart Chain. I implemented the same

277
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:07,000
staking stuff and it took me a fraction of
the day. It literally took me like six

278
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:13,000
times less time and work doing Binance
because, you know, I mean, of course, this

279
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:19,000
account model makes things easier, but the
tooling is just, you know, all there. It's

280
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:25,000
just everything works. Everything's fast.

281
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Yeah, but the EVM is disaster, right? So
it's happening every day and it's shit.

282
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:39,000
And yeah, I mean, it's because of it's
well, a broken model, right? So I mean,

283
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:45,000
definitely, I mean, we should stay away
from that because I mean, it's complete

284
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:51,000
nonsense. Even those guys, well, thinking,
understanding that it's broken, right?

285
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Even Vitalik is now proposing some new
nonsense, like replacing EVM with RISC-V,

286
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:03,000
but it's basically the same mistake,
right?

287
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Because, I mean, those guys are hopeless
in the first place. They don't understand

288
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:16,000
that the what they are doing in the first
place, right? So, well, it started as

289
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:21,000
programmable money, but then those guys
started to do decentralized computer for

290
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:26,000
something, but still no one has clear
idea, no one can explain why do you need

291
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:31,000
decentralized computer even, right? I
mean, it's nonsensical idea, also, well,

292
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:36,000
non-scalable by definition, done very
badly in EVM with all those hacks.

293
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Well, including DAO hack when Vitalik and
friends rolled back the chain and so on.

294
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:53,000
So, yeah, it's a complete disaster. And
it's, I mean, talking about billions,

295
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:59,000
well, billions are even making things
worse, right, for all those chains. I

296
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:05,000
mean, it's not just nonsensical disaster,
but also involving big money in the

297
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:11,000
process of those disastrous effects of
building a replicated programmable

298
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:17,000
calculator for unknown purposes.

299
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:26,000
I think big money, at least in my
experience, can help with innovation, but

300
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:32,000
it also can stifle it. Years ago, I was at
a conference at Stanford for the stuff

301
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:38,000
that I do here. And the director of the
group, the director of IT there at the

302
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:44,000
time, said, or the CIO, I guess, whatever
the hell CI is called, CTO, Chief

303
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Technical Officer.

304
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Said, one of Stanford's biggest problem
with innovation is that we have too much

305
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:03,000
money. If there's a problem, we just throw
money at it. So where's the pain and

306
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:08,000
growth of innovation when you can just
say, let's just buy. Let's just pay for it

307
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:13,000
kind of thing. So that does have quite of
an effect on that. When you're backed in a

308
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:18,000
corner and you can just pay your way out,
that's definitely stifling for any sort of

309
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:23,000
innovation that would have come for that.
So yeah.

310
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:29,000
That's quite an interesting point, but I
think, you know, of course there's good

311
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:34,000
and bad things from anything, right? So we
should take the good from EVM in terms of

312
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:39,000
like, you know, developer experience.

313
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Yeah, but the problem is that there is no
good things anywhere. So it's developer

314
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:54,000
experiences about doing broken contracts
which has re-entrancy and all that stuff

315
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:01,000
and then spends months on auditing things
right, properly. I mean, spend also a lot

316
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:08,000
of money because there are just few
entities in the world able to do proper

317
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:15,000
audits of this mess. Right. So, I mean,
it's, it's, well, honestly, I mean, I, I'm

318
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:22,000
looking, at, this EVM, from, 2014, right.
When, we, we had, well competing approach,

319
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:29,000
NXT 2.0 in, in the NXT community, which
was rejected and then was implemented in a

320
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:36,000
quarter. And, yeah, I mean, it, it, from
the start, it was quite clear that it's

321
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:43,000
not a good approach, but I mean, well,
fake simplicity, right, of development

322
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:50,000
also will edit issues like this DAO hack,
for example, and hundreds of hacks after.

323
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Like, do you feel, MGPai, I think when I
was talking to you before, you were happy

324
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,000
with the short amount of time it took you
to build contracts over in Binance when

325
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,000
you were doing the staking, right? So my
question to you is, do you feel as secure

326
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,000
about the contracts you've written over on
Binance in the amount of time it took

327
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,000
compared to if you were able to write
those same contracts over here on Ergo?

328
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:24,000
What do you feel more secure about? I
think my security, so I am quite secure

329
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,000
about the, I mean, all contracts, of
course, but I'm secure about the Binance

330
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:34,000
contracts because it comes from an open
source, well, it comes from PancakeSwap,

331
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:39,000
right? Which is the leading DEX on
Binance, right? So it's time tested, it's

332
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:44,000
a time tested contract, right? It's been
around for like, I think three, four years

333
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:49,000
now with no issues and it's open source,
right? So I think that also contributes a

334
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:54,000
lot to something right you know if it's
been tested if others have used it and if

335
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:59,000
it's open source you know and people can
already attack it and if there's no

336
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:04,000
attacks done like you know there's pretty
good chance of it being secure.

337
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:13,000
I think a good really good thing about
EVM is about the contracts is that a lot

338
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:18,000
of their things are open source contracts
and you know and that's missing in Cardano

339
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:23,000
actually a lot of things are closed source
and it's really weird I don't like it like

340
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:28,000
all their off-chain and all it's all
closed source on Ergo at least Ergo is

341
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:33,000
much better in that sense where the
contracts are open source for the most

342
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:38,000
part so is off-chain and generally the UIs
are closed source on Ergo but I don't

343
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:43,000
really find that to be much of an issue.

344
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,000
I mean, it was lovable. You can write a
UI in a couple of minutes, right? So

345
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:53,000
that's not really, yeah. I think the
community pushes for that too. I think

346
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,000
it's good to still see, not violently
though. Sometimes community gets a little

347
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,000
rabid, but it's good that the community
still considers the default. Are you going

348
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:05,000
to open source the contracts? Are you
going to at least open source the UI or

349
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,000
whatnot kind of thing?

350
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Because that boils down to, it is hard to
run a business on open source things. You

351
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
have to pivot to the point of providing
something more than, you know, if you and

352
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
I are going to run the same thing, MGPai,
you would have to provide something better

353
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
than I could do it. So that would result
in your skill of running the business, of

354
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
the offerings that you do, the connections
that you do. So it's a whole different

355
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
facet of business running when you're
trying to compete like that.

356
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:37,000
But if it's not open source, I mean, who
will use it? In this DeFi space, it's not

357
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:44,000
quite clear. I mean, how can it be called
DeFi if it's not open sourced? I mean, how

358
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:51,000
can you claim that it's DeFi
decentralized?

359
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,000
That doesn't stop Solana or any of those
companies or Avalanche or whoever those

360
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:59,000
guys are. Yeah, I'm claiming that. While
we're talking about other chains, guys,

361
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,000
can I ask a quick question? Bitcoin,
trying to squeeze a ton of things into

362
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,000
blocks, right? So they can essentially
become a cloud storage at this point. What

363
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:11,000
would that look like on Ergo? Didn't we
not have a block limit at one point and it

364
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:15,000
just clogged the shit out of people's
nodes and you had to crank down the block

365
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,000
limit, size limit?

366
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Yeah, so we have a block size limit, but
it can be repurposed by miners, right? So

367
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:44,000
they can lift the limits and already did
that, actually. So the current limit is

368
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:55,000
like 2x of initial. And well, miners can
always raise for more. In Ergo we have a

369
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:06,000
storage rent which is providing business
from collecting the garbage data after

370
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:17,000
four years. Here I don't see a big
problem. It's much more flexible, right?

371
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Compared to at least Bitcoin for that
kind of...

372
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Comparing with everything. So to the best
of my knowledge, there is no storage rent

373
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:34,000
anywhere, right? So Ethereum community
tried to do that tried to push for that.

374
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Vitalik, even I believe back in 2015-16,
but yeah, well, now it's forgotten. But

375
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:50,000
there is some EIP about that Ethereum. To
the best of my knowledge, that's quite

376
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:58,000
natural, I believe. Incentive model and
anti-garbage measurement is done in the

377
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Ergo only.

378
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:14,000
All right, we got 13 minutes. Let's hit
some questions. All right, all right.

379
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Matta says, kushti doing tremendous work.
I thought we'd put that kudos up there.

380
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:24,000
White Cat wants to know, nice to see
everybody back. Question for today, what

381
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:29,000
have you guys done for Ergo in the last
seven days? I think we just went on for

382
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:34,000
that for 47 minutes. But White Cat has not
sold, so. All right.

383
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Let's see. We just commented on the
Bitcoin OP_RETURNs controversy, I guess,

384
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:45,000
right? From Luke. I already had that
question. Let's see. Oh. Anything you guys

385
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:50,000
see you want to answer? Shout it out while
I look.

386
00:40:50,000 --> 00:41:00,000
I don't see a chat. Where is that? So on
mobile, I don't see it even.

387
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Well, here we go.

388
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Please comment on the Bitcoin OP_RETURNs.
But it's all this hell, actually. I spent

389
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:16,000
a lot of time around Bitcoin developers
back in 2015, beginning of 2015 when I

390
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:23,000
visited different events around San
Francisco and there were a lot of Bitcoin

391
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:30,000
developers around as well and well one of
the most topics was yeah OP_RETURNs so

392
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:37,000
there were some hot debates about making
it 40 bytes or 80 bytes or something like

393
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:44,000
that.

394
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:57,000
But yeah, I mean, it's always possible to
encode data, right? It seems well in

395
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:06,000
different ways. So, well, instead of
preventing that, it's better to provide

396
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:15,000
some simple way, I believe, to write data.
And then, yeah, some simple mechanisms for

397
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:24,000
preventing spam attacks and dust, garbage
in the UTXO set.

398
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Yeah, well, I believe Ergo is doing quite
well here, right? Well, OP_RETURNs is also

399
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:39,000
quite a simple mechanism. There is need
for some anti-dust measurements and it's

400
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:46,000
missing Bitcoin and there is a lot of dust
in the UTXO set which is slowing down

401
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:53,000
transaction validation and so on.

402
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:03,000
But yeah, well, we have what we have. So
Bitcoin protocol is quite stable now,

403
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:11,000
right? So we cannot expect any big
changes. Only some, well, some soft

404
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:19,000
fork-ish, right? Like taproot and before
segwit. But well, there are some talks

405
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:27,000
actually about demurrage in the Bitcoin
community as well. Right? So well, I see a

406
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:35,000
lot of talks about telemission or
demurrage. But yeah, well, I can't imagine

407
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:43,000
a deployment of that. But let's see. Let's
see.

408
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:55,000
All right, let's see what else we have.
We have, I think it's for MGPai. Let me

409
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:02,000
find it. Where'd it go? It is from
UrsaMina. MGPai, here you go. MGPai,

410
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:09,000
please comment on Ergo utilization in
Palmyra. Could it be done without Ergo?

411
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:16,000
And if it could, why Ergo?

412
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Yeah, I think one place where Ergo shines
compared to Cardano is with our

413
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:29,000
transaction fees. It's much more
affordable to do bulk tokenization on Ergo

414
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:35,000
compared to Cardano because the MinUTXO
for creating a token is like 1.2 ADA. So

415
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:41,000
this means that you basically got to pay
like a dollar, a dollar 50, depending on

416
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:47,000
the price, just to make like one token,
right?

417
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:55,000
And that of course, you know, is not
affordable if you have like something in

418
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:00,000
large quantities you want to tokenize or
like, for example, like beehives from

419
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:05,000
various farmers, it'll all be a unique,
unique asset. So, you know, if you want to

420
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:10,000
do like a thousand, you'll need thousand
unique mints on Cardano, which gets really

421
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:15,000
expensive. It's not scalable, but compared
to Ergo, you can do it for a fraction of

422
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:20,000
the cost because the main UTXO on Ergo is
like worth a fraction of a penny. And even

423
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:25,000
if Ergo does like a 10X or a 100X, it's
still going to be much cheaper than

424
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Cardano.

425
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:36,000
So are you, are you worried, do you have
plans in place for demurrage? I mean, if

426
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:40,000
these RWAs sit in a box, or are you going
to have like requirements where when an

427
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,000
RWA is put inside some sort of box and
it's going to sit there for a while, you

428
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,000
always, you always have to include with
some ERGs or something like that. Yeah.

429
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:52,000
The last thing you want is like something
pulled from the chain that's supposed to

430
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,000
be tracked forever, right?

431
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Yeah, the idea is that you have a bunch
of tokens in a contract, right? Or if

432
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:09,000
there is a contract, you let the contract
be recreated on its own without doing

433
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:15,000
anything extra. So we would have that
along with an off-chain bot seeing if it's

434
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:21,000
close to expiry, it can just recreate that
and prevent the need for demurrage being

435
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:27,000
collected at all, right? But adding ERG to
an asset itself is a form of deferring the

436
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:33,000
demurrage if you don't do anything about
it. But if you do something about it, you

437
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:39,000
don't really need to worry. So you could
have some ERG as a buffer. Then on top of

438
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:45,000
that, you can have an off-chain that
constantly recreates the UTXO so demurrage

439
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:51,000
doesn't need to be collected.

440
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Cool, cool.

441
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Let's see what else we have here.

442
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:09,000
What is the state of your platform of
tokenization?

443
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:17,000
So yesterday I was on a call with some
African government, as I told in the

444
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:25,000
beginning. So the interest in having some
platform for real-world test tokenization,

445
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:33,000
right? And then, yeah, with Ergo to build
some, well, financial to link around for

446
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:41,000
funding small and medium scale miners. So
what's the current status of tokenization

447
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:49,000
platform? What's doable there? Is it open
sourced and available to test?

448
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Yeah, so we have the Palmyra protocol as
an original prototype. But personally, I

449
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:05,000
don't have any involvement at the moment.
But I have Luca, LDG, who's been on Ergo

450
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:12,000
the last month or two, working on updating
the Palmyra contracts beyond MVP. He's

451
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:19,000
working on implementation of that and I'll
probably be on it in the next month or two

452
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:26,000
While I wrap up some Cardano things And
you wrap up SigmaLock front end bots.

453
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Yeah Don't forget about that MGPai All
right, we've got the cook reminded

454
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:42,000
everybody that the NH roads and he's very
correct and

455
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,000
And maybe MGPai can speak to this since
he is an EF member, right, MGPai? He said,

456
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,000
they were talking about marketing. And
Ayanesh says, to me, it seems like EF

457
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,000
wants marketing to come from users and the
ecosystem. It's not bad, necessarily. But

458
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,000
most users, myself included, just want the
number to go up and don't want to have to

459
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,000
work for it. I mean, that is what it is.
Some people join the ecosystem and you'll

460
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,000
see, I mean, look at a lot of us up here
at front of the camera, people in the

461
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Sigmanauts, they join the ecosystem and
they recognize that Ergo's focused on kind

462
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,000
of a grassroots movement as far as
marketing goes. That was the original

463
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,000
intent of mine.

464
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:18,000
My understanding of the intent of the EF
was that. And we're doing our parts, not

465
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,000
being paid just for the good of what Ergo
is and what it represents compared to all

466
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:26,000
the other projects out there. But that
being said, the EF has given out grants,

467
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:30,000
guys. So I know that it's work sometimes,
but if somebody has an idea that says,

468
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:34,000
hey, we want to do this kind of outreach,
like take Mark the Shark. He wrote a

469
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:38,000
proposal that said, look, we want to do
outreach via mining. We're going to

470
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:42,000
develop a mining tool that's easy and plug
and play kind of thing with a dashboard

471
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:46,000
and these kind of NFTs to get people
excited about it.

472
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:56,000
And he got a grant for it, and he's
working on it as we speak. So that stuff

473
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:00,000
is possible. Write up a nice proposal,
send it to the EF. And if you don't want

474
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,000
to do the work, maybe you'd like to write
the proposal and then find other people to

475
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:08,000
do the work. But here, at least, the
people I'm looking at right now all pick

476
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,000
up pick up a wrench and start tightening
stuff and loosening stuff and playing with

477
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:16,000
stuff with no idea of being rewarded other
than the fact that we're creating

478
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,000
something unlike anything else.

479
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Yeah. Yeah. I also don't understand what
users mean here. So how are they using?

480
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Because, well, I'm here currently in Ergo
because I'm also a user, right? Otherwise,

481
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:43,000
what's the reason I'm not getting paid by,
well, EF or, well, users or any other

482
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:49,000
entity, right? So, well, the interest is
to use the Ergo, right? And, well, the

483
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:55,000
reason why I'm using it because, well,
for, well, things I'm interested in simply

484
00:50:55,000 --> 00:51:01,000
there is no alternative, right?

485
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:15,000
So, well, still there are a lot of pros
of UTXO. Well, I think from what I'm doing

486
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:24,000
as a user, the guy who is also doing
contracts on Ergo and so on, and I hope to

487
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:33,000
see that being used in the real world,
right, because, well, I'm a little bit

488
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:42,000
tired, to be honest, to be in the space
for like 15 years to the moment, and,

489
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:51,000
well, here, well, on this, nonsense about,
I don't know, it's always in the different

490
00:51:51,000 --> 00:52:00,000
form, but about the same after all, right?

491
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:12,000
So, I mean, some projects are claiming
something, some hype, a number go up,

492
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:19,000
number go down, then yeah, I mean, it
repeats with some new narrative. It's a

493
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:26,000
little bit insane, to be honest, right?
Well, to continue to be saying in this

494
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:33,000
space, you need for some hope to see that
being used in the real world. what I feel

495
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:40,000
right by developing contracts and well now
now thinking about off-chain systems and

496
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:47,000
so on well and well reviewing contracts
right in peer-to-peer finance and so on so

497
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:54,000
well I think it's very natural.

498
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Well, and now, well, in this space, there
are a lot of strange talks about products

499
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:12,000
market fit, right? I mean, even for
blockchains, right? Good occurrence. So

500
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:18,000
it's, it's hard to say what, what, what,
what, what, what is a product here, right?

501
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:24,000
I mean, naturally, if there is product,
then what's the decentralization here? I

502
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:30,000
mean, the blockchain. So it's hard to
understand all the stalls but yeah I think

503
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:36,000
that Ergo is pretty good and well
fulfilling all the requirements when you

504
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:42,000
are building tools for our grassroots
finance right for well sovereign finance

505
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:48,000
peer-to-peer economic interactions.

506
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:59,000
And, yeah, it has perfect lifestyle,
market fit, right, so, well, if you are,

507
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:06,000
well, thinking about, well, building
stronger communities and, well,

508
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:13,000
sovereignty of those communities and
self-individual sovereignty, then, yeah,

509
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:20,000
well, it's probably the best toolset I'm
personally having now, right? So, well, as

510
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:27,000
a user, well, I don't see a real
alternative.

511
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:34,000
No, I agree. I think it's the best tool
set that I've experienced. I can't imagine

512
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:39,000
building what I built here in this system
for students with Ethereum or even

513
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Cardano. It would be impossible. I can do
an initial airdrop of brick to students

514
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:49,000
and give them 0.1 ERG, and they're set for
10, 15 transactions done each. What's done

515
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:54,000
and done is forgotten. The code out there,
I know the tool set, it wouldn't work

516
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:59,000
anywhere else.

517
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:09,000
So that's testament to me that as more
and more people start recognizing this and

518
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:15,000
building things on their own for their own
use cases and recycling code using other

519
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:21,000
people's, it's going to become very
apparent that when it comes to real-world

520
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:27,000
use cases, Ergo is really above everybody
else in that sense.

521
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,000
It's 10.02, guys. MGPai, you're going to
turn into a pumpkin. Are you skipping

522
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:34,000
class for this?

523
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:38,000
No, no, I have a later class today, so.

524
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,000
When's your first final?

525
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:44,000
It's in a week and a half.

526
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Oh, not bad. Oh, one last question, guys.
This is from UrsaMina. This is a neat

527
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:52,000
question. Small amount of data, but they
want to know if they can use blocks to

528
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:56,000
store an encrypted password list,
immutable storage. Like how secure would

529
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:00,000
you trust encrypting your passwords into a
file and dumping it on chain?

530
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:07,000
I mean, just the encryption algorithm,
right? That you've got to trust. Yeah,

531
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:13,000
right. Exactly. Not really the blockchain.

532
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:23,000
How many bytes is it that you can store
in the register?

533
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:30,000
There is only a box limit, which is about
4 kilobytes. But you can spread our many

534
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:37,000
UTXOs from it.

535
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
All right, that's a good point. You
could. So just develop an app that breaks

536
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
it in half, breaks it in parts.

537
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:50,000
Yeah, that's a great point. Yes, so you
can save in chunks. And yeah, well, four

538
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:58,000
years after, you will pay for storage
rent. Then for four kilobytes, it would be

539
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:06,000
about like five ERG even, right? Something
like that, four or five ERG. So a few

540
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:14,000
dollars, which is quite reasonable, I
believe, amount considering that you're

541
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:22,000
storing your four kilobytes of data on
hundreds of machines, right?

542
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:29,000
That'd be interesting to set up a
password vault system on the blockchain,

543
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:34,000
right? Where everything's put there and
you're just... Right? I mean, but what's

544
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:39,000
the risk, right? You have LastPass just
had a huge nuke thing a year or two ago

545
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:44,000
right I think they had a big scare where
the keys were in charge of one person

546
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:49,000
essentially whereas you know something
like this each person would have access to

547
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:54,000
their own keys only I mean LastPass
probably had some bullshit about like

548
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:59,000
recovering if you forgot your password or
something like that right that's probably

549
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:04,000
how right exactly yeah safety net yep yep
yep so there's a master key but

550
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Yeah, that'd be interesting. Yeah, that
would make me nervous, MGPai, because

551
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:17,000
you're really trusting whatever encryption
algorithm that you're using at the time.

552
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:22,000
I mean, I would trust them, right?
Because it's been time tested, right?

553
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Like, no one's been breaking RSA
encryption. But it's like you kind of lose

554
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:30,000
a layer of protection, right? Because if
you have something, I know, like encrypted

555
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:34,000
in your own machine, like someone has to
get to your own machine to get that

556
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:38,000
encrypted. Yeah. You're taking that gate
away from them. Exactly. You take that

557
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:42,000
layer of protection away by directly
putting it on the blockchain. But after

558
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:46,000
that data is taken, then it's just
figuring out the password or brute forcing

559
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:50,000
it.

560
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:57,000
In that sense, those layers are the same,
just attacking something that's already...

561
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:00,000
UrsaMina wrote again, and he's saying,
how would anyone know its passwords? And

562
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,000
he's right. I mean, you can, like,
protection through obscurity, right, kind

563
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:06,000
of thing. But I guess if it got to follow
certain patterns, and UTXOs were created

564
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:09,000
around a certain amount of times, like if
it always spanned through UTXOs, and it

565
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:12,000
always was made at the same time, and it
was always made by certain wallets, you

566
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:15,000
could probably do some lookups and figure
it out.

567
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,000
If you break it into like chunks though,
I'm sure like, no, like how would someone

568
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:25,000
even know that there's encrypted data on
chain?

569
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Send it through the mixer.

570
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:34,000
Yeah, that won't work. If the data is
like in multiple like chunks UTXO, it's

571
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:38,000
kind of messed up.

572
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Yeah, but you also can store data in UTXO
protected with a stealth address, right?

573
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:53,000
So then recipient is not known. Right.
Right. Right. I mean, it's, it's, non,

574
00:59:53,000 --> 01:00:00,000
only that's, yeah, well, it's, it's a
stealth.

575
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:04,000
You could store usernames and passwords
and separate UTXOs as well. Right. And

576
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:07,000
somehow find a way to link them just known
to the user based on some sort of hash or

577
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:10,000
something that they would do. So if
somebody, if somebody got a hold of the

578
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:13,000
usernames, that wouldn't matter. Somebody
got a hold of the passwords alone, that

579
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:16,000
wouldn't matter. But only the user knows
how to bring them back together.

580
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:29,000
Well, the next step in those off-chain
systems I'm thinking about, like off-chain

581
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:38,000
cash would be adding some privacy, right?
So, well, when you may have a private

582
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:47,000
transfer before on-chain redemption then
yeah it would be quite cool right so then

583
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:56,000
you have some private half-chain cash with
yeah well transparent on-chain reserves

584
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:05,000
right and redemption against them but yeah
that's quite different topic all right

585
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:14,000
boys let's wrap it up but yeah so what we
are doing next week ma spaces what

586
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:22,000
AMAs are easier, that's for sure. Yeah,
by the way, I will do spaces next
