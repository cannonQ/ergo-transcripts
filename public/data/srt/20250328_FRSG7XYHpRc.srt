1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
You'll notice the format's a little
different today.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We were hoping to do more of a community
structure.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Anybody can join the Zoom.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
If you look in the lower right-hand
corner over there of the stream, you'll

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
notice a Zoom info.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
So if you want to chat in person, you
want to come up and join the community and

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
give your point of view, ask questions in
person, that kind of stuff, then just join

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
that Zoom info in there.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Come in with your camera off.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
As you can see, HQ and kushti's camera
are off.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Feel free to ask voice questions.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It doesn't matter.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Hop in.

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So today we've got a couple community
members.

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
We've got Grayman, who's a Sigmanauts.

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
We've got Mark the Shark, who is at the
Mining Disrupt in Florida, sent by the

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Sigmanauts.

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
For those of you who don't know, Mining
Disrupt is a big kind of ASICS mining

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
conference.

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And Mark is going there punching GPUs
into everybody as he walks.

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:02,000
And then we've got HQ3rr, which is the
main core dev of MewFinance.

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
And then, of course, we've got kushti in
the upper left-hand corner.

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
So feel free to join and ask questions,
or pop them in the chat, or whatever you

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
like, or just shout them into a dark
closet or something.

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm sure we'll hear them.

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Why don't we start with Mark?

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Mark, tell us about Disrupt.

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
What you found?

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
How are the people?

30
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Any tips or ideas you have for the
Sigmanauts Mining Pool or anything like

31
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
that?

32
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Yeah, I mean, obviously, so mining
disrupt it's a huge Bitcoin mining

33
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
conference.

34
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
So, you know, everything and anything
Bitcoin, I talked to some people, okay,

35
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'm here with Ergo, you know, GPU mining
chain, they're like, Ergo, didn't that go

36
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
to like, six, like years ago, it's like,
no, you know, some people kind of snobby

37
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
towards me, I asked him like some
questions about their pool, they're like,

38
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
you know, acting as it's like, Hey man,
I'm just trying to pick your brain here.

39
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It's like, you don't have to be like, you
know, any type of way.

40
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
It's kind of funny.

41
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
But some other people have been very
nice, you know, so I was asking, you know,

42
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
what's their pay pullout strategy.

43
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
So a lot of people are using full pay per
share.

44
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
So regardless of we find a block, people
get paid upfront.

45
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
So that's what a lot of miners in the
Bitcoin space, specifically the pools are

46
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
doing.

47
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
There's another pool.

48
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
It's very similar to Lithos it seems but
they're more of a decentralized pool.

49
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I think it's called Ocean and basically
allows their - and I'm not really sure I

50
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
guess how it maybe works on Bitcoin, but
the guy was suggesting the pool makes the

51
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
blocks on.

52
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
And so instead of the miners, well, the
miners make the that allows them to put

53
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
their name in the coinbase.

54
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:54,000
And so now they can install you know, the
name on the.

55
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I lose you guys.

56
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
No, we're still here.

57
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
We heard most of it.

58
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,000
So you're saying the mining pools will
just pay out regardless?

59
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Are they taking a hit there?

60
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Like, what if they don't find a block for
days?

61
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
They're going to have to pull from the
bank?

62
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I guess it all evens out in the end kind
of thing?

63
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Or miners mining to a pool with
guaranteed payout, accepting less of a

64
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
payout so more profit goes to the pool
kind of thing?

65
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Yeah, I think there's probably, I didn't
get to ask the fee.

66
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I think the fee is probably a little bit
higher.

67
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
But it reminds me of the idea that qx()
had that he wanted to implement area

68
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
rather he did, but it's sort of like a
call option for the miners, right?

69
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
So if you want to take your money now,
it's like, well, we can still do PPLNS,

70
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
but if you want to do say pay per share,
you know, you have the ability to do that

71
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
with qx()'s sort of tool.

72
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
But I think technically the mining pools
would be taking a hit.

73
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
But it's really so the miners get paid
all the time.

74
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
And we had one miner was like, hey, how
come I haven't got paid yet?

75
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
And it's like, well, we're PPLNS.

76
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
So you don't get paid until we find a
block.

77
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
And he was kind of like disgruntled about
it a little bit maybe.

78
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
So something we should take a look at, I
guess, DX pool, I talked to the pool

79
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
operator there.

80
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Pretty much same story relative to the
payout scheme.

81
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
And he said, you know, hey, I reached
out, I told the people to check out the

82
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Sigmanauts mining pool and the reason why
there he said there's kind of like no

83
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
incentive there and so maybe there's not
enough information like what we're doing

84
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
with demurrage what we're doing with the
bonus tokens and then he even was

85
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
suggesting like well how can I tell how
can I trust that it's like reliable you

86
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
know if I put it there it's not going to
be you know my mining rigs are always

87
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
going to be up you know and we have a
pretty good up time we do I would say yeah

88
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
so no really concern there but I was
looking at other people's dashboards that

89
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
they have like on the screen and stuff and
you know, that's really like the first

90
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
thing that people see for our pool is like
our dashboards and our websites and stuff.

91
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
So I'm making it a point now to make it
think definitely is it needs it'll be a

92
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
lot quicker and faster.

93
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:24,000
And so I made a prototype yesterday.

94
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I did it like a live stream.

95
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I'm not sure how many people were
watching but it was fun I think like 50

96
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
people I saw this morning.

97
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Yeah, nice.

98
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
And then there's another pool.

99
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
It's called Brains pool and they're
essentially made sort of this like Bitcoin

100
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
OS and I didn't really understand it,
whether it's like actually the miner

101
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
running where it's like that's what mines
it, or if it's more of like a Hive OS, it

102
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
seemed like it was like sort of both in
some sense.

103
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
But in any case, I was like, well, what
are your guys' monetization strategies?

104
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
He's like, well, it's the pool fee and
then this OS.

105
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
So you get like two and a half percent
from this OS.

106
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
And then, of course, the pool's fee.

107
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
And that pretty much pays for everything.

108
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
And they have they had like like five
people at their booth.

109
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
So I was like, OK, interesting.

110
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
So from the Sigmanauts perspective for
the mining pool, I know we can maybe take

111
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
a look at making some sort of system like
that, but I'm not really sure where to

112
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
start.

113
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
But just trying to think of different
monetization strategies, right?

114
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Different marketing strategies sort of.

115
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
But I think I definitely got a lot of
feedback as to where we are in our

116
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
ecosystem relative to our pool and the
hash rate and then maybe how we can sort

117
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
of grab more hash rate.

118
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
You know, so from a security perspective
within the pool, you know, marketability

119
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
and then just reliability, I think.

120
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
My question is, how do we make them as
exciting as the Cardano people are bound

121
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
to their stake pool operators, right?

122
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
They'd wear shirts with their stake pool
operators face on it, for God's sake.

123
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Why can't that be the same with mining
pools, right?

124
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Allegiance, but I imagine it comes down
to miners are geeks. Well that too plus

125
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,000
but I think there's a lot more hopping
going on and mining than there is. Then

126
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,000
there is in the stake pool operation
outfit right because you may have miners

127
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
may hop from one coin to the next to the
next to the next whatever is profitable

128
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,000
and pay for their rigs and so there might
not be that kind of specific attachment to

129
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,000
those pools or those coins in that aspect.

130
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Oh, we don't see that in our pool,
though. You know, we have a consistent

131
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
hundred gigs.

132
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
We did have 150 gigs like a week ago for
like a day. Somebody popped in with 50, 40

133
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
to 50 gigahash.

134
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
So that was really sick.

135
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I'm not sure where they went but you know
and then even in the website, maybe we

136
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
need to have like a little like hey what
kind of feedback would you like to see and

137
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
then that's of space so we can be like hey
I like this or you know, some space, you

138
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
know, aside from Telegram for people to
reach out to, just less friction, I guess.

139
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I think you were challenged last week,
Mark, to open up a Signal link, right?

140
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
What's that signal?

141
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Yeah.

142
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You can be right there with Donald Trump
and the secretary of defense.

143
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Oh my gosh.

144
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Yeah.

145
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Our war plans will get leaked from the
Sigmanauts mining pool.

146
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Yeah.

147
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Oh boy, but you found a connector, right?

148
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
So anybody who has time can work with us
to make that connection happen if you want

149
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
to as well.

150
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Or one of us will do it in our free time.

151
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
But yeah, super cool.

152
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Did you say you met up with the DX pool?

153
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
What's his, did you mention demurrage at
all?

154
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Yeah, I did.

155
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Yeah, he actually is not really sure what
it is.

156
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
He actually requested some information
and materials about it.

157
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
So I was like, okay, yeah, I'll totally
like when I get a moment, I'll send some

158
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
of that information over.

159
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
But of course, we don't want. Selfishly
speaking, we don't want DX pool to have

160
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
demurrage because then it's like, well,
you guys are going to find all of our

161
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
blocks, all of our blocks of demurrage,
you know.

162
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,000
But I mean, I don't like that we're in
kind of, what's it called, what's the

163
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
word, purgatory right now with demurrage,
right?

164
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Demurrage was made so that, well in mind,
it was thought of so that there'd be a

165
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,000
nice jump from when it was turned on to
actually pools utilizing it, right?

166
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,000
So now we're in a spot right now where
not just pools are utilizing it, but we'll

167
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,000
see a rogue person come on and just snipe
blocks from demurrage as well.

168
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
So non-miners are actually getting it.

169
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
So I feel that's a shame that non-miners
are losing some of that stuff.

170
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
So it'd be nice if more pools engaged so
that that wouldn't be possible and the

171
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,000
miners who originally intended to get that
are scooping up that demurrage.

172
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Yeah, absolutely.

173
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
But it's only for a few blocks, I've
noticed.

174
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Yeah, here and there.

175
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Yeah.

176
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Yeah.

177
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
It's like, I skipped a week and I came
back to the wallet and we had like 170

178
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
ERG, you know, over two weeks of
collection.

179
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Yeah.

180
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
That is nice.

181
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
So I mean, that's incentive right there,
you know, get extra ERG or mining tool,

182
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
you know.

183
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
And it's not that difficult to run.

184
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
It's a modified node.

185
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,000
It's a modified, you don't even have to
modify mining core.

186
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I think that runs on its own.

187
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
And then you put a config into mining
core or something.

188
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
And then you run a little storage rent
app.

189
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
And that's it.

190
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
It just does its thing.

191
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Tell what wallet for it to collect to and
watch that wallet and see the stuff come

192
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
in.

193
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Yeah, that's really a no brainer.

194
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Oh, HQ is going to talk.

195
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Let's hear HQ.

196
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Go for it.

197
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
HQ, what's up with you?

198
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
How's MewFinance doing?

199
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
MewFinance is doing great.

200
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I just wanted to share some idea which I
just got about ready to mining.

201
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:04,000
So as we know that we can see how many
blocks were mined by all the pools.

202
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,000
So how about we create a simple tool
where people can compare in dollar value

203
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,000
of how much they are getting for mining
and that's how we can show them.

204
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
We can show them that the extra bonus
they get, they are getting more profit on

205
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
mining with Sigmanauts pools.

206
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Right, but actually the only thing we
don't know is how many people are mining

207
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
to that pool, right?

208
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
So we can't do that individual division,
unfortunately.

209
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
So we know that X amount of people are
mining to our pool, but we have no idea

210
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
how many people are mining to DX pool.

211
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
So while we would know the totals coming
in, we wouldn't be able to divide that by

212
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,000
a number to say, OK, the individual person
gets this much in this person's.

213
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
This pool's 1% higher.

214
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
This pool's 2% higher in payouts with the
bonus tokens of the thing.

215
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
But that's a good divide.

216
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
You can just divide the hash rate, and
that's it.

217
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Oh, divide it by the gigahash.

218
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
So saying for each gigahash, it gets
this.

219
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Oh, great idea, guys.

220
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Fantastic.

221
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Yeah, totally.

222
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:09,000
That's where the individual miners might
help you if you were trying to make this

223
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:15,000
into more of a social thing. One of the
problems is that you know who knows like

224
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:21,000
what was the blockchain that told
Herominers that if they didn't get some of

225
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:27,000
their people off line. I mean, are there
800 people mining there? And then all of a

226
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:33,000
sudden, like two or three are the vast
majority of the hash rate. So it doesn't

227
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:39,000
matter if 700 of the 800 people leave. I
mean, that's the problem with mining. It

228
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:45,000
goes with being permissionless and
pseudonymous.

229
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Well, I understand that in other chains,
right?

230
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Miners might not care and point their
rigs to wherever the profit is, which is

231
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
fine.

232
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
But on Ergo, at least miners need to
understand that they have a lot more

233
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
control over the network.

234
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
So it's in their best interest not to
saturate hash on one pool in those

235
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
instances.

236
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
So, I mean, that's a hope in the future,
right?

237
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
But I think we're in a long, not a long,
but I think we're a ways away from that,

238
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
where miners are going to start
recognizing that they can make those

239
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
parameter changes.

240
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
But HQ, I love that idea.

241
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
That's great.

242
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
That shouldn't be too hard to do either.

243
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Yeah, for sure.

244
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
We could say, hey, our block reward is
like, I mean, what is it right now?

245
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I think is it 15 or is it 18 right now?

246
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I think we're about to hit 15, I think,
right?

247
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Okay.

248
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
So yeah, we could be like, it's 18 plus
three, you know, or whatever on average

249
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
for the demurrage for the week, you know,
for our block rewards or, you know, bonus

250
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
tokens, that kind of thing.

251
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Yeah.

252
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Right.

253
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Yeah.

254
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Yeah.

255
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Actually, I was, I was not doing it like,
like a future.

256
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
So we can do like a past in past 30 days
to have mined with one GB on Sigmanauts

257
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
pool, you could have made this much.

258
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Yep.

259
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
And you have, you have made this much on
another pool.

260
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
So you will be showing the profit you
have made.

261
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
You could have made.

262
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
So people like to see those kind of
numbers.

263
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
So yeah, so we already have the price
feed for all the tokens we have in the as

264
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
supported tokens.

265
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
We did with the extra tokens we do.

266
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
So yeah, you just have to do the sum up
of all the plus all the all the tokens and

267
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
just show the dollar value of it.

268
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
You don't even need to show the value
because nowadays I think miners don't even

269
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
care about how many they're getting.

270
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
They will only care about how many
dollars they are getting.

271
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
So if you are showing them that you are
getting more revenue for mining with us,

272
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
then you will have more incentivization
for people to move to the pool.

273
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Awesome.

274
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
You think you're going to have that built
tomorrow morning, HQ?

275
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
You've got enough time.

276
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
It's not too late for you over there.

277
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Just a reminder, I'm a father now.

278
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
We're all fathers here.

279
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Yeah, right.

280
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
But my kid is three months old, so not
like yours.

281
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Ergo dad NFTs. That's no big deal. Wait
till they can crawl or walk. Yeah, you're

282
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:11,000
in for it then. Tell you that that's where
I'm in right now, dude. My little one. Oh

283
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:18,000
my gosh. She's all over the place dude
running around. Dad dad pick me up.

284
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Nice. Very nice.

285
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,000
All right, let's hear about let's hear
about 6.0 from kushti kushti are there. We

286
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,000
put him to sleep.

287
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

288
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Yeah, I'm here.

289
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Sorry.

290
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Mic was off.

291
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,000
So, yeah.

292
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Finally, it's time to activate it in the
mainnet.

293
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,000
So still, there are some things to check,
some things to consider, like mainnet

294
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,000
activation parameters, and we'll also use
a client suitable for the mainnet and do

295
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,000
some final audit.

296
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:06,000
And so on, but yeah, well, I think we can
think about proposing a voting starting

297
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:13,000
from early May, something like that.

298
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:22,000
So yeah, and with 6.0 done, we can
actually promote, well, different things

299
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:30,000
which are possible now with 6.0 such as
trustless Bitcoin.

300
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Relay, not Bitcoin only, right?

301
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,000
And well, schemes based on that.

302
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Then support for bullet proofs, right?

303
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:51,000
For verification of some zero-knowledge
proofs on the blockchain and so on.

304
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:57,000
And yeah, we can think about sub-blocks.

305
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Well, consider some roadmap with public
testnet activation and so on after 6.0.

306
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:18,000
So yeah, well, it's been polished.

307
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Time to release it finally.

308
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,000
And yeah, well, this week I will do
another release candidate, version

309
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,000
release.

310
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Well, now with rules and so on, and yeah,
it should be close to the final version.

311
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:58,000
It should be more or less. So yeah, well,
and in Sigmanauts DAO, we also formed a

312
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:06,000
group to work with mining pools and
exchanges to inform them about 6.0

313
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:14,000
release, so to check that everyone Well,
for exchanges, it would still be better to

314
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:22,000
update the nodes.

315
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Maybe not, because they actually will be
made from the transactions, deposits and

316
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:36,000
withdrawals, with 5.0 and 6.0 network
after the activation.

317
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:43,000
But yeah, well, anyway, there is needs to
inform and to track.

318
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:52,000
So yeah, well, it's going on.

319
00:18:52,000 --> 00:19:04,000
And yeah, well, a lot of updates after
6.0 to be planned.

320
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,000
How many steps along the way will we need
to update Testnet?

321
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I think I'm on 6.0 R2 and you have 6.0 R3
out.

322
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
What are the breaking changes that are
going to need to update along the way

323
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
there for your testing?

324
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
You mean for the mining nodes?

325
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Yeah, so you would need to update to RC4,
which is coming soon.

326
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
OK.

327
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,000
So RC3, which was a little update?

328
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Yeah, so it was just a little bit
different from RC2.

329
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
But yeah, RC4 would be different,
actually.

330
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Quite different from RC3.

331
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:58,000
And yeah, well, there is need to update
on the mining nodes because for other

332
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:04,000
nodes there are 5.0 and they will be
there.

333
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:12,000
We will do some testing, well, how 5.0
nodes would survive under 6.0

334
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:19,000
transactions.

335
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
And if anybody's running a node right now
on mainnet, you can run a testnet node on

336
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
the same network.

337
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
The more testnet nodes we have, the
better, because it gets a little tough to

338
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
sync if only a few devs are running
testnet nodes.

339
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
So any community members want to run
testnet node, instructions are up there.

340
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Use a 6.0 R3 candidate that's there.

341
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:48,000
and spin it up, try to sync it up, and
join in and allow devs to successfully

342
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:54,000
test things so they're not continuously
using mainnet to test stuff.

343
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Right?

344
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Have you reached out to qx() at maybe to
see what we need to do to update our node

345
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,000
for demurrage relative to this new update?

346
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,000
No, I haven't. He's got an update coming
down the pipe that he was gonna I thought

347
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,000
he was gonna give us soon so I'll reach
out to him. I know he's busy on Lithos as

348
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,000
well so we'll ping him see what's up.

349
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Yeah.

350
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Awesome.

351
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Nice.

352
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,000
What about, so for those of you that
don't pay attention to the forum or miss

353
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
some stuff in chats, one of the big things
that kushti and community members are

354
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,000
working on is the Ergo Book.

355
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:44,000
And one of the guys that's here is going
to be a contributor to it, Grayman.

356
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
You there?

357
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
You mind chatting about what your
contribution to the book's going to be?

358
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Well, it's work in progress, so who knows
what it'll end up being, but what I'm

359
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
working on is more about the monetary side
of things rather than the technical side

360
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
of things.

361
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:06,000
And I'm sort of writing about the
development of King dollar as it came out

362
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:12,000
of the pre fed era entered the Fed.

363
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,000
And then post World War two and trying to
explain how a paper currency and then

364
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:22,000
eventually a digital currency overtook and
then replaced gold and silver and other

365
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,000
metals.

366
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:34,000
And then I'm trying to tie that back to,
you know, how did that happen and what is

367
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:40,000
the magic that they undid and how can we
bring that magic back with

368
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:46,000
cryptocurrencies as a way to sort of
defeat the king?

369
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:53,000
And I'm trying to frame it all around a
discussion of silver, because silver

370
00:22:53,000 --> 00:23:00,000
coinage was very important to the
development of America's money system, all

371
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:07,000
the way from the beginning until around
1965, which was after Bretton Woods.

372
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:14,000
So after the dollar was established as
the unit of international trade, but

373
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:20,000
before Bretton Woods too, where we
officially reneged on the gold standard

374
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:26,000
and told people that they could no longer
convert their dollars into gold.

375
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,000
And so silver, all through this entire
process, was always sort of sitting in the

376
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
background, always sort of the second
thought of what is money, and yet there

377
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,000
the whole time.

378
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
And the other reason why both gold and
silver interests me is just because they

379
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,000
are way more decentralized and distributed
than any cryptocurrency, including

380
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Bitcoin.

381
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
And both of them have larger market caps
than Bitcoin.

382
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:02,000
So if you talk to a Bitcoin maxi, they
will assure you that everything else is

383
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:07,000
going to zero because Bitcoin's first and
that's what the network effect does.

384
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
And my counter to that would be, I mean,
you haven't even beaten silver yet.

385
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:18,000
So and in terms of centralization, you
guys have a real problem.

386
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,000
And in terms of utility, you have
enormous problems.

387
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:27,000
So we are still in the infancy of the
digital money era.

388
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,000
And it's at this time that the
developments, the work that you guys are

389
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,000
doing make more difference than anything
else.

390
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
So you can go and go on Twitter or X and
listen to all the noise of people saying

391
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
this or that.

392
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
You know, listen to what's that guy,
Justin Bonds talking about how Solana is

393
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
cypherpunk and all that's nonsense.

394
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:57,000
And if you put it in context, this is all
just noise.

395
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
This is the stuff that a hundred years
from now, nobody's going to remember any

396
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
of that.

397
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,000
And what they're going to remember is
what are the concrete steps that were

398
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
taken by devs that changed the way that
money works and that eventually get

399
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,000
adopted because it becomes inevitable.

400
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:21,000
It's not about rooting for your team or
network effects or any of this or that.

401
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
It is about if you want to be able to
achieve this goal, then you have to do

402
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
these things.

403
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
And Bitcoin did the first two or three
steps.

404
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:35,000
I mean, it's remarkable and it's come a
long way, but there's a lot more than two

405
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:40,000
or three steps that need to happen for it
to become money.

406
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
And honestly, it's walking in the wrong
direction right now.

407
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
It's following gold.

408
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:51,000
And the dollar already beat gold.

409
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
It'd be interesting to get your take
between the gold and silver battle, so to

410
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
speak, relative to Bitcoin and AI.

411
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,000
At the conference, a lot of people are
worried about AI, but only in the sense of

412
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:08,000
taking up the electrical capacity of what
Bitcoin miners could be turning on.

413
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Instead, they're making more money with
AI.

414
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
In terms of competing for, you know, the
resources and things like that, and like,

415
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
say, machinery, like, should we point our
machinery to gold or silver, you know, AI

416
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
or Bitcoin?

417
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,000
That'd be kind of an interesting, I
suppose, comparison, maybe.

418
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Well, so Warren Buffett's famous for
saying that gold is just a shiny rock.

419
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,000
If I buy it and put it in my safe, at
best, it's held its value, but it doesn't

420
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,000
do anything.

421
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,000
And I think it was was it Margaret Mead
who said that, you know, people wonder,

422
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,000
like, whether or not a group of a small
group of people can get together and

423
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,000
change the world.

424
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
In fact, that's the only thing that ever
does.

425
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,000
So Warren Buffett and Margaret Mead and
most of modern Western society believe

426
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
that money is not just a chip that you use
to trade back and forth between a zero sum

427
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
game.

428
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:15,000
It is a tool that is used to create new
things, including new money.

429
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:22,000
And so AI corresponds to, it's more like
investing in a stock or in something that

430
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:29,000
actually produces changes to the world and
then generates income.

431
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Whereas mining Bitcoin is just getting
your diminishing return on a system that

432
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,000
is I mean, theoretically gonna go for
another hundred years before the emissions

433
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:44,000
are completely zero, but I mean, that's
sort of dependent on the concept that the

434
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,000
price is gonna keep going up as much as it
has, and then eventually having a

435
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:54,000
ludicrous fee market, the so-called
security budget problem.

436
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:07,000
So you need the money to be flexible,
programmable, and to be useful for the

437
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:16,000
creation of new work, of new companies, of
new commerce.

438
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:23,000
And Bitcoin arguably is going in the
wrong direction, but GPU mined coins,

439
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:29,000
which can soak up the extra cycles from AI
farms that are idle due to lack of users

440
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:35,000
at the moment, could be quite useful
because it would give them a way to still

441
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:41,000
spend their energy that they've already
paid for in these giant, I mean, a lot of

442
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:47,000
these data centers are now getting their
own power stations to go along with them.

443
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,000
And so that's a cost and they need to,
they need that energy to keep flowing.

444
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,000
They need to spend that energy and turn
it into something.

445
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Hopefully they're getting paid for
changing people's profile pictures to

446
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,000
anime, which apparently is the latest
excitement.

447
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:10,000
But whatever it is, when they're idle for
some reason, then it would be cool for

448
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:16,000
them to be able to not only secure a
currency network, but also to run the

449
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:22,000
security that's necessary to make that
currency network valid.

450
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:30,000
To rely on yeah, that's interesting.

451
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,000
I wonder how much idle time there are in
these farms that are dedicated AI. They

452
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:40,000
said at the conference not a lot like
they're they're always running pretty

453
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:45,000
much. And I was like I was kind of shocked
to hear that like they don't have enough

454
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:50,000
capacity. They're suggesting demand is
that high that it's always on. Wow.

455
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:58,000
I'm not sure I believe that, but it
wouldn't be buyer's remorse.

456
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:03,000
They spent like some ridiculous amount of
their pile of cash, like 80, $90 billion,

457
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:08,000
setting up this stuff in Michigan or
Wisconsin.

458
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:13,000
And it's just an, I mean, it might be
true for the guys that you're talking to

459
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:18,000
at this conference running relatively
small data centers, but you know, some

460
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:23,000
right now you've got, the competition at
the top levels of AI, at the corporate

461
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:28,000
levels of the people that are trying to
sell, not to you, not to somebody that's

462
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,000
going to tune their own LLM, but to people
like my clients that just want to run

463
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:38,000
their law firm or whatever it is and run
it more efficiently.

464
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Microsoft's, whatever it is, Copilot
versus Google's Gemini, those are the

465
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:52,000
systems that are going to that are trying
to sell to those people and I bet you that

466
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:57,000
there's a huge amount of idle time on all.

467
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Sure.

468
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Yeah, totally.

469
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Yeah.

470
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
And that is the vast majority of the GPUs
or I guess let's just say AI chips,

471
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
whatever they're used.

472
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:16,000
I guess these are not really GPUs, but
not ASICs.

473
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Right.

474
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Yeah, they were suggesting like it has to
be like a tier three data center has to

475
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:27,000
have 99% uptime because I guess like some
of these quant firms people I guess are

476
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:32,000
training their own LLMs and they'll run a
new model every morning or at a specific

477
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:37,000
time or they're training and fine tuning
as a model for like six to nine months.

478
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
And obviously if you have any
interruption in like that six to nine

479
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
month case, obviously that's devastating.

480
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
We'll probably get sued.

481
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
It's kind of what they're suggesting.

482
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:51,000
So it's kind of interesting.

483
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:56,000
I'm ready for the lawsuits when an AI
design bridge or building collapses.

484
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,000
All the finger pointing is going to go to
building, right?

485
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Oh, jeez.

486
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
I won't be doing that.

487
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Oh, boy.

488
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Oh, well, that's pretty cool, Grayman.

489
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
We got a quick question in the chat.

490
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
12] **Kushti**: Yeah.

491
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Just to add some notes, I think it's
actually quite awesome to write

492
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:32,000
non-technical, but monetary things,
monetary theory and practice related.

493
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Because, well, I think we should be in
the space not for tech, but for money,

494
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,000
right?

495
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:50,000
But not in the sense of this retarded
crypto industry.

496
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,000
So, yeah, it should be about reworking
money, right?

497
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
And tech is just tooling after all.

498
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:02,000
So, well, if you are here for some tech,
then the question is, what this tech is,

499
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:08,000
what for?

500
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
What are you going to do with this tech?

501
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,000
You cannot just be tech for tech.

502
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:25,000
It's just like, I know, maybe be in a
hammer for hammer.

503
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Yeah, but it's got to be solid and
reliable.

504
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:35,000
And in my opinion, open source at the
core level.

505
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Right.

506
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
If not, it won't be money, right?

507
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Nobody is going to the idea that people
trust Solana or any of these other closed

508
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
source systems.

509
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
The system is insane to me.

510
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Like, how could they?

511
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Yeah, so yeah, it should be open source
for sure.

512
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
But also it should be permissionless,
right?

513
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Because well, it's truly permissionless.

514
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Right.

515
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,000
No payment gateways as far as that goes.

516
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Somebody wants to run something
themselves, they can spin up their own

517
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,000
node, mine it, and send their own
transactions through it.

518
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,000
And nobody can stop you.

519
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Right.

520
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Yeah.

521
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
And also, yeah, peer-to-peer.

522
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:31,000
So it's also doesn't matter a lot because
that's a guy that's a cypherpunk.

523
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:39,000
fake cypherpunk troll Justin Bond so he's
praising Solana and so on.

524
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Scalable layer one and so on but in fact
so all those systems just threw away

525
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:51,000
peer-to-peer architecture, right?

526
00:34:51,000 --> 00:35:00,000
It's very different story so it's not a
big deal to do a system which is operating

527
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:09,000
in a federated way, so peer-to-peer, while
a system which has some super nodes, some

528
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:18,000
parts will be peer-to-peer.

529
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:25,000
It would have crazy TPS and whatever, but
what's the meaning here, right?

530
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
There is no meaning, there is no value.

531
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:33,000
It calls into question the value of the
ledger that is created from such a system.

532
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Same deal with DAGs.

533
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:41,000
I mean, or really any system that allows
pruning on the fly or these kind of, well,

534
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:47,000
the compromises that you make by trying to
shoehorn high TPS into something because

535
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:53,000
you think that you're going to compete
with Visa that way.

536
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
MasterCard, it doesn't work that way.

537
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,000
What we're trying to do is we're trying
to create a global ledger as a baseline

538
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,000
and then build on top of that ledger.

539
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,000
And that's, I mean, how do you do that
with a DAG?

540
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,000
You know, a chain of chains or a mesh or
any of these other architectures just seem

541
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,000
very, I mean, they would say innovative
and certainly they can lead to a lot of

542
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,000
speed.

543
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:26,000
But I really wonder in the long run
whether this, let's just say the security

544
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:31,000
assumptions are not clear to me in those
systems.

545
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Oh, yeah, true, true.

546
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:41,000
And yeah, so well, I think it's worth to
do first some monetary design, some

547
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:48,000
monetary a kind of architecture, and then
yeah, tech would follow because we already

548
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:55,000
have well, like cameras and such.

549
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:03,000
It's not a problem to use them or to use
the solution.

550
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Yeah, that's the problem.

551
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:10,000
should be quite clear what the space is
doing.

552
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:21,000
It's hiding the problematics of money
creating, good money and so on.

553
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:27,000
It's going to complete nonsense
sometimes.

554
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,000
I mean, are there any other chains out
there that are focusing on monetary

555
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,000
tooling and a new form of peer-to-peer
money and finance?

556
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
I don't know.

557
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:46,000
So, well, there are some quite exciting
private cryptocurrencies, right?

558
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,000
But they're just trying to do cash,
right?

559
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:57,000
But the question is how how do you
produce that cash, right?

560
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Privacy of payments does matter a lot,
but first you need to solve quality of

561
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:09,000
money problem, then privacy of payments.

562
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
It would follow.

563
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,000
So, yeah, well, it's a different story,
still very different.

564
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:24,000
And aside of that, yeah, I don't see,
unfortunately.

565
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Well, there are some efforts, but yeah,
they are small scale and usually, yeah,

566
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,000
well, not complete.

567
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Right.

568
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Also, very important.

569
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Yes.

570
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
All right.

571
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Someday it'll become sexy.

572
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Yeah, we got a question in chat from
Richie.

573
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:51,000
He says, kushti, can Bitcoin forks like
Litecoin and others introduce sub-blocks

574
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,000
via a soft fork?

575
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Yeah, actually, I'm in touch a little bit
with one Bitcoin Cash developer.

576
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:10,000
So we're actually thinking about a little
bit similar concept.

577
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
They have even a paper on that.

578
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,000
It's called Tailstorm.

579
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,000
And actually, he visited Ergo Platform
chat once.

580
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,000
That's a guy, Bitcoin Cash autist.

581
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:32,000
So, yeah, well, sometimes, so yeah, well,
it's kind of, I believe very generic

582
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:41,000
solution and it's also similar in some
aspects to layers, which is going to be

583
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:50,000
released for Cardano.

584
00:39:52,000 --> 00:40:00,000
It's some Cardano network upgrade plan.

585
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:06,000
And yeah, so for Bitcoin, cash, Litecoin,
I believe even for Bitcoin itself, maybe

586
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:12,000
it's possible.

587
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Something like that.

588
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Let me think, because they already have
somewhat different from early days

589
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:31,000
transactions, block transactions, but to
say, propagation mechanism, called compact

590
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:39,000
blocks, right?

591
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Block is generated they are not selling
all the transactions because well they are

592
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:57,000
using some protocol already and it's not
that hard to introduce different more

593
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:06,000
efficient there are actually a bunch of
papers on how to improve compact blocks

594
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:15,000
for Bitcoin and that's where I've got some
ideas for sub-blocks actually, so yeah.

595
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:24,000
The only question is yeah, well rewards I
guess how to reward miners?

596
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,000
It's even harder than a Bitcoin, but
maybe solvable.

597
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:34,000
I don't know. We need to check carefully.

598
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,000
All right, well it's hitting the top of
the hour and I have to go to a in real

599
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,000
life meeting.

600
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,000
I just want to say that, you know, we've
been trying different formats.

601
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
I love this format.

602
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,000
I love the fact that community members,
Sigmanauts, Grayman, HQ, Mark the Shark

603
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,000
come on and chat and give updates.

604
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:59,000
That's exactly what Ergo is and I think
that's ideal.

605
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:05,000
But I understand people also like the
other format, the more straightforward

606
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:11,000
people chatting at you with AMA style
formats.

607
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
So we'll see.

608
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Keep tuned to the chats and we'll figure
out what's going on next week.

609
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Yes.

610
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,000
So yeah, if there is a demand for some
classic format, then next week, maybe

611
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,000
there could be four of us again.

612
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:31,000
So Joe, you, and me.

613
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Well, however, the classic may.

614
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Why not?

615
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
All right, everybody.

616
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Thanks so much for joining HQ, Grayman,
and Mark, kushti.

617
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,000
You guys all have a great rest of the
day.

618
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Yeah, see you, gentlemen.

619
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Yeah, thank you, guys.
