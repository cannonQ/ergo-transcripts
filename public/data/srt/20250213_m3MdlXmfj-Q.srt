00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Hello and welcome to the Ergo AMA, weekly
AMA.

2
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
It is Wednesday, February 12th in sunny
New York and dark Japan. You can see it's

3
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
very dark in Japan because Dan is, it's
dark there in this picture and he's very

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
frozen. Dan had to do a reboot of his
machine like 10 minutes ago, but I think

5
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
he's still on one of those IBM or HP Intel
486s so it's taking him at least 30

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
minutes to reboot so we're gonna kick this
off without him today and you may be

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
wondering why is this on Wednesday and
that's because our amazing AV person is

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
traveling tomorrow. So we decided to move
this a little earlier.

9
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
So it's my job to start this for you
before Dan gets here. That's great. Maybe

10
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
we can cover everything. And then by the
time Dan gets here, he won't even have to

11
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
talk and he can just go. So start popping
your questions in the side there to give

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
me something to chat about as well, but as
far as Ergo goes everything's going great

13
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
everybody right we have Binance some
progress on Binance for Rosen Bridge and I

14
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
love how Rosen Bridge is getting more I
don't want to say balls here, but they're

15
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
getting more obvious with their major goal
here, right? And that's to backdoor all

16
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
these central exchanges.

17
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
And a lot of you may have been following
a couple weeks ago, maybe a month ago,

18
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
where we are trying to backdoor Kraken,
right, with Rosen-ERG. So we applied for

19
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
both. We threw both in a couple weeks ago
when Peter asked us to and I mean we'll

20
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
take what we can get we have enough
liquidity on Cardano I think as much or

21
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
more than some of the exchanges on the
Ergo side So I think any idea there will

22
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
be would be great either way. So looking
forward to that. We should see the guard

23
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
code coming soon. We'll apply that to the
guards. Make sure that's all hunky-dory

24
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
and then you should see a watcher update
there as well.

25
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
One thing I want to tell you, I think I
said it in the dev update the other day,

26
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
the way the Watcher and Guard software
work is it's through Docker, right? So

27
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
there are repositories that are registered
on Docker. And part of those repositories

28
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
aren't Rosen Bridge repositories, right?
They are like the PostgreSQL program,

29
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
which actually stores a database. So what
happened is the main official repository

30
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
for that SQL software I think was pulled.
So if you're restarting a watcher or

31
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
getting ready to spin up a watcher for
Binance or just anything like that or

32
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
moving your watchers, you're going to get
an error there unless you follow the

33
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
instructions, the new instructions in the
list. So if you're trying to use the same

34
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
software, the same folder that you did
before and you're trying to pull it, you

35
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
need to do a little bit of research just
to read the instructions again. There's

36
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
just another SQL, PostgreSQL repository
that we're using now that works just fine.

37
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
And it's no different there. In the
guards, we had to migrate our database

38
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
over to do it. When I did it for my
watcher first, I just bombed it through

39
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
without a migration. So it just had to
pull new stuff down. But yeah, so be aware

40
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
of that when you're prepping for that kind
of stuff, if you're going to run a binance

41
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
or you're moving your watchers around.

42
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Well, I had more to say, Dan, and you
showed up. I was expecting it to be like

43
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
30 minutes late.

44
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Oh, it's okay.

45
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
It just seems that I'm 30 minutes early
because you're talking about watchers and

46
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
stalking and whatever you're talking about
right now.

47
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
How's it going, Dan? Big stuff in
Cardano, right? In Cardano land with your

48
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
token, right? No?

49
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Well, soon, yeah, it's going to be
launching. So we're planning to do for

50
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:33,000
probably later this month. So that is on
the horizon. And yes, we're going to be

51
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:40,000
using the Rosen Bridge heavily to, you
were just talking about Rosen Bridge,

52
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:47,000
right? You weren't really talking about,
you know, watchers and stocking and things

53
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:54,000
like that. Yep. I hope not. No, no, no.
Any more weirdness from you qx().

54
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Anything's expected, I guess. Right.

55
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Yeah, exactly. Yeah, so we're going to be
using Rosen Bridge pretty heavily. So

56
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:09,000
yeah, right now we're actually planning to
use it. Well, of course, Cardano and Ergo,

57
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:15,000
we have assets that are going to be moved
to Ergo from Cardano. We also have assets

58
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,000
that are going to be moved to EVM. So
we're going to do the multi-chain launch

59
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,000
to have a situation and it's going to be
really interesting how that pans out. Our

60
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:33,000
market makers are going to have a lot of
fun with that.

61
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
What's this? Can you fit me in then? You
know, I'm on Twitter. It's a guy who go

62
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
through breaks on Twitter sometimes. But
you're having a CEX listing. Is that what

63
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I saw? A CEX and a DEX listing?

64
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Yeah. So we actually got several in the
oven right now. Yeah. And so we're going

65
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,000
to be, of course, going into the biggest
DEXes. And we also have a couple of CEXes

66
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,000
already in the pipeline. And we're going
to be signing with more. We're just kind

67
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:10,000
of trying to, I guess, plan it out well
strategically so that we have deep

68
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,000
liquidity versus just thinning it out over
a bunch of different exchanges. Because

69
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:22,000
actually, there's quite a few exchanges
that you can just sign with and get listed

70
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,000
if you have the money. And I mean, they
have kind of have volume, you know, some

71
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,000
of them is a little it's kind of fake.
Some of them, it's organic. Some of them,

72
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,000
it's a mix of organic and fake. But in the
end is just kind of like, okay, so where

73
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:46,000
do you want to concentrate your liquidity,
you know, because we're like, for example,

74
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,000
we had well, I still have the opportunity
to sign with a pretty major one, but it

75
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,000
costs a bunch of money. And so the choice
that I made was, well, instead of spending

76
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:04,000
hundreds of thousands of dollars to list
on this thing right now, I'll spend that

77
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,000
$100,000 or $200,000 to bring liquidity
and to bring support to the actual token.

78
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,000
They just made more sense like that have
more control over where it goes and you

79
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,000
know, that's just seems like a better
plan. Yeah, so that's going to be later

80
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:28,000
this month. Yeah, applying that we're
going to that pretty soon.

81
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Yeah, yeah, I agree. I think I think
strategically distributing your liquidity

82
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
is wise, you know, as long as you're not
suffering for access, right? Because

83
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
there's a trade off. Do you do you spread
liquidity over several different places so

84
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,000
that there's more access to more people?
Or do you maybe take a hit on access and

85
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
make your liquidity quite deeper so that
the people that want to buy can really

86
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
invest in your token without too much
damage to their price impact or slippage

87
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
kind of thing? So yeah, that's got to be a
tough thing to work out.

88
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,000
That's really the bottom line here, is to
say you want to have really stable trading

89
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:22,000
when you just launch. because there's
going to be quite a few people coming in

90
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:28,000
there for the trading side of it, and
there's going to be some unlocks

91
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,000
happening. So you want it to be really
smooth. You don't want it to have really

92
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:40,000
low volume and then have these ridiculous
spikes and then really I mean, even if it

93
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:46,000
spikes up, you still can't really do
anything with that if you're a trader,

94
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:52,000
right? Because there's no volume. And if
there's no volume, well, then it's like,

95
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:58,000
well, as soon as you try to do anything
with that, it's going to dump the price.

96
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,000
So that's basically the plan here is that
we're going to strategically use only a

97
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:10,000
couple of sectors at first to bring pretty
deep volume in or significant volume in.

98
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,000
have it stabilize, and then we can branch
out from there. We signed with a very good

99
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:22,000
market maker, a really prominent one. One
of the things is they actually you know,

100
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:28,000
have a strategy for us to, you know, it's
like, okay, so we should do this and this

101
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:34,000
and this and for your pathway to, you
know, if you want to get it on a tier one

102
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,000
exchange. Oh, and so we, I got a question
here actually from, from big 3D asking is,

103
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:46,000
will RSPalm be listed on a CEX at launch?
So I'd like to, but the thing is that I

104
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:52,000
need support for RSPalm at a CEX. We're
going to try to get that on the ones we

105
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:58,000
have one, actually we have a couple that
are very flexible about what they can do.

106
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:04,000
They're not huge exchanges, but they're
flexible so we can potentially integrate

107
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:10,000
RSPalm there. So that's something that
will come a little further down the line,

108
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:16,000
but not at launch. Yeah, that's been my
world in the past few weeks.

109
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Oh, and yeah, so if anybody is going to
Hong Kong, what is it? I guess next week.

110
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I'm not going to be there, unfortunately.
I have some family things to attend to,

111
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,000
but Sam is going to be there. Nice yeah,
you're gonna be hanging out with with

112
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,000
kushti because kushti is gonna be there.
So, if you guys, anybody's there, you

113
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,000
know, and you see Sam, you know, ask him
like the tough questions, like, for

114
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,000
example, why did he wear those short
shorts? The first time I represented

115
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Palmyra at that, you know, whatever it
was, the consensus in Austin, he did that,

116
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,000
you know, and the first time my company
was represented and he wore these super

117
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,000
short shorts that I forbid him to ever
wear again.

118
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Were they jean shorts like from?

119
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,000
no no they weren't jean shorts they were
like they had this like like no no they

120
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,000
were like some some like design on them or
something like it was like fishes or

121
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,000
something i forgot it was just really
awkward and yeah and they were like a

122
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,000
little too short like they call them i i
think in australia they were like like

123
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,000
budgie smugglers

124
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:43,000
They're not like Tobias's little jean
shorts from Arrested Development.

125
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
No. Okay, darn it. I can see that because
I was picturing that and I was getting,

126
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
you know, that was, I may have had to shut
off the camera at that point thinking

127
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
about that. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

128
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
That's great. Sam's going to be with
kushti.

129
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Yeah, yeah, he's going to be with kushti.

130
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Is this a booth event? Do you have booths
to just kind of just hang out, walk

131
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
around, shake hands, kiss puppies?

132
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Yeah, kiss puppies, kiss children that
look like puppies and whatnot. They're

133
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:18,000
actually going to be doing some combined
Palmyra Ergo work over there, talking to

134
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:24,000
some potential funds and some exchanges
that could potentially, again, do listings

135
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:30,000
for Ergo and Ergo assets. Yes, they're
going to have a pretty full pretty full

136
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:36,000
schedule over there. Well, you catch them
at the at the event And we're actually

137
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:42,000
been really working really fleshing out
the Lithos index as well Right. So that's

138
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:48,000
also been yeah actually Sam's been doing a
lot of the a lot of the work over there

139
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:54,000
and the he's been working with kushti and
on really kind of try to flesh out exactly

140
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:00,000
how the thing works. So I mean, you know
Oracle two up and that kind of stuff,

141
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:06,000
right?

142
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Do you gotta Push the input, you know
kushti is actually very proactive on it

143
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
He's actually trying to get more and more
input, which is of course, you know, very

144
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
very welcome I mean, it's great

145
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Does Sam ever get a vacation, Dan? How
often do you let him out?

146
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I don't. He's not old enough to have a
vacation yet. No, sorry. It has to be at

147
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:39,000
least in his mid-30s and losing much more
hair. Then he gets a vacation, maybe,

148
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:45,000
maybe. Poor Sam. Yeah, we'll see. We'll
see. We'll see how much hair he loses in a

149
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:51,000
couple of years and then we'll weigh
against PTO and whatnot.

150
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
You're at least putting him on a flight
to Hong Kong, not a boat, right?

151
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Well, so, you know, this is actually,
he's not going on a boat, but he might as

152
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
well be because, you know, like I tell
him, you know, just get yourself a nice

153
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
flight. Yeah. I mean, it's like a four
hour flight, but still it's four hours,

154
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
you know, four hours of sitting. And, you
know, and I tell them, you know, Cathay

155
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Pacific, it's not expensive, but it's
nice, you know, and it's not, you know,

156
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
it's not cheap, but it's not expensive and
it's nice. And they get good location at

157
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
the airport and, you know, it's a Hong
Kong airline and everything's like, so he

158
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
sends me a list of these like super cheap,
like budget airlines out of which I only

159
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
know one. You know, it's like, you know,
we fly, you know, the like an airline is

160
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
that it's like, it's called like we fly
you and don't crash air or something. It's

161
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
just some really like, I don't know. I
don't know. He likes that kind of stuff.

162
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I try to Dan, that's what you want for a
CEO. You want somebody that is price

163
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
conscious and sacrificing themselves.

164
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Look, we're price conscious enough. All
right. I mean, my, the last hotel I stayed

165
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
in in Singapore was in the middle of the
red light district.

166
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I'm sure that was an accident, Dan.

167
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Yeah, it was definitely an accident. It
was actually in the tranny part,

168
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
apparently in the tranny part of the Red
Light District. So that was even a bigger

169
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
accident. Yeah, because I was telling you,
I was driving down in a taxi back to the

170
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
hotel from the conference. And, you know,
I had one of those like, you know, see the

171
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
sights, my friend type of taxi drivers
where he was just telling me, he's like,

172
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
well, over here to the left, they have
this and you have over here to the right,

173
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
you have this. And he's just like, oh
yeah, well, so. None of these are like and

174
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
he just points out you see all those like
yeah, none of them are girls. I'm like, oh

175
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
great You know, so like anyways And then
my my hotel room had no windows zero no

176
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
windows And the sacrifices you make for
this company, Den

177
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Well, sacrifices that I make for our
investors as well, because we'll bathe in

178
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,000
luxury when we're bathing in massive
profits. Well, you don't want to bathe in

179
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,000
lithium. It's toxic.

180
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Well, on-chain lithium, I guess. Lithos
peg stablecoin.

181
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
That's nice. Yeah, so it's, yeah, it's
not the most pleasant thing, but you know,

182
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
like some things, I mean, like I got that
hotel because it was actually the cheapest

183
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
hotel I could find that was not like, you
know, like a hostel or, you know, like an

184
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
hour away from the conference, you know,
and it was still, you know, relatively

185
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
good rating because, yeah usually you know
usually try not to be super cheap hotels

186
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
you know i usually like to kind of look
for something that's comfortable

187
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
comfortable and conveniently located so
that i can you know i can just Got to do

188
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
the business and not worry about it. I
mean, I don't mean lap of luxury, but I

189
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
don't know. I don't want to be sleeping in
a shack either. So Sam likes that. You

190
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
know, Sam, Sam was like, you know, he was,
he was trying to get me to share a room

191
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
with him the other, like, in Tokyo. I'm
like, no, man, you're getting your own

192
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
room.

193
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Maybe he's just scared of being alone
then.

194
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Look, I've seen him in his underwear
enough, okay, in the past several years.

195
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,000
We shared enough rooms. I'm like, look,
man, we're somewhat funded now. We can

196
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
afford another room. We can afford to pay
another 150 bucks for you to have your own

197
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
room and for me to have my freaking
privacy, man. I'm 47 years old. I need my

198
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
privacy. I'm cranky.

199
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
That's very sweet. Dan, I'm looking
through the Hong Kong. There's a lot of

200
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
speakers here. I'm wondering if, Dan, if
you're sending Sam with a bunch of Ergo

201
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
stickers that you stole from us, you
should send them with them so they can

202
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
reach them all over.

203
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Yeah, we have Ergo stickers in the
office. I'll make sure I'll load them up

204
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
with Ergo stickers so they can be
represented over there.

205
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
This is a huge conference. I'm still I'm
still scrolling the whole time. You're

206
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
talking about you sleeping habits. I've
been scrolling through the speaker list.

207
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Yes It's a shame I can't go but yeah,
it's you know, I am You know, my mom is in

208
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
town. So I I can't go. Yeah Yeah, so but
yes He's gonna go to all these parties,

209
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
he's gonna have all this fun. To me, you
know, most of these parties, I go in

210
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
there, I'm like, all right, where's the
food and why is it so fricking loud? Yeah,

211
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I am. You know, cause some of these, like
you have to know which ones to go to,

212
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
because there's gonna be a bunch of
parties, there's gonna be literally just

213
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
clubs. You know, just people go clubbing
from these things. And I'm just like, no,

214
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
man, I don't wanna go clubbing. I wanna
talk to some people and do some

215
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
networking.

216
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
All right, Dan, I'm scanning here. I got
a guy here. I wanted to ask you a question

217
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
here. What? And maybe that'll lead into
something else. We got Edgy and Yago from

218
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
BitcoinOS. Is that the same BitcoinOS that
was a big hype in Cardano a couple months

219
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
ago?

220
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Yeah, yeah. Yago.

221
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Yeah, you know him? You know the guy?
Best friend?

222
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Not personally, but I know.

223
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
What happened to that? What happened to
that hype and the blow down and the blow

224
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
up?

225
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I know an evil parod that was named that,
but anyway. You know, let's keep on that.

226
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Well, so I look at these products and
people say oh these competing with Rosen

227
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Bridge is this competing with this, you
know, is you know Why you judge one? Well,

228
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
so I look at these things and I'm like,
okay Rosen Bridge is so far from Any

229
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
centralized thing that these that anybody
creates like this that it's not even the

230
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
same I mean sure it gets a similar thing
done, right? Well, not Bitcoin OS, but

231
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
let's say other bridges gets a similar
thing done, but it's just such a different

232
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I mean Like I explain it to people even at
conferences and they're like wait what you

233
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
know you have like 200 watchers you have
you know this many guards and there's

234
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
gonna be a hundred guards doing this it's
not like some dude and five of his friends

235
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
with a bunch of keys that they're they're
doing kind of thing so it's like just a

236
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
totally different animal so

237
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Well, some of these products are
competing. I don't feel that Rosen Bridge

238
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:25,000
is in competition with Bitcoin OS at all.
I mean, it's just a different approach. It

239
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:31,000
solves many different issues. It handles
data transfers differently. It's a

240
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:37,000
different animal. I just don't feel that
it's like a direct competition. And the

241
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:43,000
same with But with CKB, CKB has got a
similar product and it's RGB++, and that's

242
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:49,000
not really...I don't think it's competing
with it. I think it's actually a really

243
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:55,000
good complement to RGB. what Rosen Bridge
does. I think people who say that, they

244
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:01,000
don't really understand the real use cases
for this thing. I just think that because

245
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:07,000
like Rosen Bridge is actually pretty damn
unique in the way it does things. That's

246
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:13,000
why we use it so much and that's why we
decided to incubate it when it needed to

247
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:19,000
get that boost. And that's why we're going
to keep using it. And of course, it

248
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:25,000
doesn't mean that we're not going to use
other ones. But again, for example, I have

249
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:31,000
these other ones that were offered to me,
and they were just centralized. Like, oh,

250
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:37,000
we have a centralized bridge that can do
this for you. I'm like, well, I don't want

251
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:43,000
a centralized bridge. I don't want that.
To me, it feels dirty.

252
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I mean, it's like it's with those kind of
things. It's like it's not if it's like

253
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
when right when's that?

254
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I Mean I I can't afford that like, you
know for One of my main jobs is to

255
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:14,000
minimize risk, you know to minimize the
risk.

256
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Sorry Dan 10% of your supply is now, you
know wash because

257
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,000
And yeah, I can't have that. I can't have
that. That's irresponsible for me to do

258
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,000
and for the people that are in my
ecosystem. So I try to decentralize as

259
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:36,000
much as possible. And whenever we actually
are looking for other solutions with the

260
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,000
different products that we have, we also
try to do as much decentralization as

261
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:46,000
possible. Because number one, it is
obviously a safer and more robust

262
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,000
ecosystem, and it's also financially
viable for us because it eliminates pain

263
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:56,000
points like security issues that we would
have to deal with if it was centralized,

264
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,000
amongst other things like auditing, for
example. If you've got a centralized

265
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:06,000
ecosystem with open source, you can talk
about this before you have community

266
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,000
auditing of the source code. So again,
you're You're reducing risk like that as a

267
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:16,000
company, so it just makes sense to me. So
yeah, like I said, I don't feel like it's

268
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,000
any kind of real competition, like
head-butt competition, just different

269
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:26,000
flavors and whatever works for you for
your particular use case is what you use.

270
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Yeah. I feel like Rosen's a Swiss army
knife that you can download from the

271
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
internet and 3D print and have a fully
functional backdoor to everything. Oh,

272
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,000
look at that.

273
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Yeah, actually, I got this at the Swiss
Army store in Zurich.

274
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Wow. Was it like 50 bucks?

275
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I forgot how much it was because you know
who bought this for me?

276
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Sam.

277
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
No, Charles Hoskinson.

278
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Wow Yeah Actually, this is not the only
one he bought for me and I actually don't

279
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:23,000
have it here I should I'll bring it to the
next day. I may be trying to send you a

280
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:29,000
message then He was trying to send me a
message. It's like do more shit And he

281
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:35,000
actually actually I have it downstairs and
is this like Like just like just this big

282
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:41,000
bulky thing, but he bought me the largest
Like well accessory wise Swiss Army knife

283
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:47,000
they make I'm one of those big fat guys.

284
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
It's like this wide.

285
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,000
It's like this wide has got you know,
it's got like a 12 piece socket set on it

286
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,000

you know French seasoning Like it's just,

287
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,000

288
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,000
used it. I'm just like, like, cause the
thing is like weird to hold, you know,

289
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
because the blade is about this big, but
the handle is like this wide. But you

290
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,000
know, it was, it was, it was a good
thought and it was a nice memory. This was

291
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,000
back in, uh,

292
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Back in the old days, Dan.

293
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Yeah, like back in the old days, yeah.

294
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:30,000
So I'm looking at Testnet right now, and
kushti had me push. He just had a new jar

295
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:35,000
up for 6.0 RC2. I think there was a little
tweak to RC2 we had to do. And we put it

296
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:40,000
in, and I recognize why. If anybody's
watching the Dev Update, You'd have seen

297
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,000
kushti say, why the hell is testnet so
irregular qx()? And it was because I was

298
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:50,000
mining from a rig down in my basement that
obviously needed a reboot. So I put on a

299
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,000
temporary thing after I updated and we're
getting, let's see. The last 32 blocks

300
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:00,000
were 16.77 seconds each. So testnet's
burning through until it gets up to the

301
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,000
good difficulty where it'll slow down a
little bit, but we've got faster than

302
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:10,000
sub-blocks testnet going on right now for
kushti to test sub-blocks on and Unreal to

303
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,000
test his front-ends on that he's working
on. So that's good. That's up. If anybody

304
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:20,000
wants to join testnet, please do. Reach
out to me, I'll give you the config file,

305
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,000
I'll give you the jar file. The more
people we have running it, the better.

306
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:30,000
That means I can reduce my GPU pointing to
it.

307
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,000
The rough thing about Testnet, Dan, is
that in one person, let's say I'm mining

308
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,000
it and I'm mining it with a 3090, you
know, and that's getting 250, 300 mega

309
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
hash at it. If I do that for a couple
days, the difficulty is going to be pretty

310
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,000
high. And if somebody comes in to help out
in mines with their CPU, they're going to

311
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
be hard luck finding a block for a while
until the difficulty goes down. So the

312
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,000
more people we have on testnet, the
better. So if you're up for it and you

313
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
want to run a little machine, you have
like an old 1050 or something like that

314
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,000
that you want to do GPU-based mining. I'll
feel for you. Even if you don't want to

315
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,000
set up Mining core anything like that
Spreading the hash is still good. I have a

316
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,000
mining core test that you can point to
that that does that as well So just

317
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,000
offering out there to everybody Dan It's
very sweet of you

318
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:38,000
What else is there to talk about? You
following US at all? US crypto, that kind

319
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:43,000
of stuff? There's so much speculation
going on. It's like hard to keep track,

320
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Dan. I feel like there's like shock things
thrown out there on the wall to see what's

321
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,000
going to stick and see what people are
going to freak out about and not freak out

322
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:58,000
about. So I don't know if it's all a test
or whatnot.

323
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
But the thing about it is that, you know,
I think actually we talked about this

324
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
maybe on the last AMA. I remember having
this conversation, but actually, no, it

325
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
was actually another AMA that wasn't Ergo.
But, you know, I've been doing so many of

326
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
these that it just looks a blur in my
mind.

327
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
It's just so famous.

328
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Yeah, I hear you, Dan.

329
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,000
I'm so famous. I'm infamous.

330
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Yeah.

331
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,000
You know, nobody gets that reference. Do
you get the reference?

332
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
I'm infamous.

333
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Yeah. He's so famous. He's infamous.

334
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Steve Martin Yeah, I know that one.

335
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Yeah. Yeah. See I got I still got it damn
Well, yeah, you still have that was a good

336
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:44,000
movie That's great Yeah

337
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Yes.

338
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:51,000
So hold on. So basically, what are we
looking at? What are we experiencing right

339
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:57,000
now in the U.S.? We're basically
experiencing this like thing that happens

340
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:03,000
to Google Meet when your connection slows
down and then it catches up and then like

341
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:09,000
it, you know, so it has like, you know
what it does? Like when like everybody

342
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:15,000
starts talking super fast because your
connection is trying to catch up to the

343
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:21,000
present. The same thing is happening in
the US. This was supposed to start in

344
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:27,000
2016. It was 2015-2016 is when it was
supposed to start, really, in reality. It

345
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:33,000
didn't because Trump was elected and
instead of focusing on legislation and

346
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:39,000
regulations, everybody started focusing on
Trump. and from all sides. And so, you

347
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:45,000
know, and that's what happened. It was
just kind of left to be the wild, wild

348
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:51,000
west because everybody was just so
obsessed with Trump. And so now what we

349
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:57,000
have is a delayed reaction. And that's why
it's so intense. That's why it's so like

350
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:03,000
archaic, because now they know that
they're already late, They know that they

351
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:09,000
had four years of Gensler just toppling
his way through it, and that pissed off a

352
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:15,000
lot of people and drove a lot of business
out. They're desperately trying to get the

353
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:21,000
business back and the momentum back
because so much crypto is American,

354
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:27,000
because people are dissing Trump's like,
oh, American cryptos, how do you say it?

355
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:33,000
kind of you know he's a he's a character
but he doesn't just like with like with

356
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:39,000
business i just don't feel i feel pretty
much everything that he blurs out even as

357
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:45,000
as like as crazy as it always sounds, it's
always part of some plan, right?

358
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Well, that's what worries me, Dan.

359
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,000
That's what worries me. The thing about
American Crypto is, and again, this is

360
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,000
speculation, but what I think he's doing
is he understands that a lot of this

361
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,000
business was driven out of the US. It was
just driven out. It was pushed out. ICOs

362
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,000
were pushed out. Crypto companies are
pushed out. Everybody went to Singapore,

363
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Seychelles, parts of Europe, Estonia.
Everybody just kind of scattered out of

364
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,000
the US because of this, like I said, of
the Gary Gensler Gestapo, because nobody

365
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,000
wanted to go to prison for this kind of
stuff, because the government can't decide

366
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,000
how much money they want to keep of yours.
So, but now what he says, okay, look, you

367
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,000
know, we want you back. We want you back
because what it also does, it has thinned

368
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,000
out the pool that is needed to create
sensible regulation. because they pushed

369
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,000
out so much business right now, they look
at it like, okay, so how do we make it

370
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,000
happen? Because we don't really have a
good like sandbox for these regulations

371
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:47,000
because there's just not enough proper
businesses operating out of the US because

372
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:51,000
everybody avoids is like the plague.
because it's just because of all these

373
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,000
regulations. So he says, okay, American
crypto, blah, blah, blah. Yeah, I mean,

374
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,000
yeah, it sounds crazy from the outside to
some people, but to me, it sounds like

375
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,000
he's trying to get these people back and
settle down so that they can actually have

376
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,000
a calm business audience, crypto and
blockchain-based business audience that

377
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,000
are not gonna be scared of going to prison
to sandbox with. you know they're gonna

378
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,000
bring all the stuff back again like i said
you know it's it's it's the of course it's

379
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,000
like a slogan you know like yeah we want
american you know american crypto what's

380
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,000
american crypto but in the end is just he
just wanted back in the u.s. so they can

381
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,000
make proper regulations of the can make
sense out of it And I think that that's

382
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,000
smart if that's what's happening indeed,
in fact. Indeed, if that's what's

383
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:35,000
happening. Yeah, and again, going back to
what you said about things getting a

384
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:39,000
little archaic, well, then like I said,
that's what it gets like. It's like that

385
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,000
volatility. If there's not enough volume,
there's going to be crazy volatility. They

386
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:47,000
need more volume in there. They need more
stuff happening there for there to be less

387
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,000
volatility and more stability to create
proper regulation. That's my thought on

388
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,000
it.

389
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,000
I'm a little more skeptical than you
there, Dan. That's very positive thinking.

390
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Yeah, but you're in New York and you work
in academia. Of course you are.

391
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Well, my thought is, I mean, Occam's
Razor explains a lot of Trump's behavior,

392
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,000
I think, personally. And that is that the
simplest thing is at play here, and the

393
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:40,000
simplest thing is that he's Really looking
out for his own interests. So there's

394
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:45,000
always as you said, he always kind of
sometimes blurts out his plans beforehand,

395
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:50,000
right? I'm just saying I'm gonna let you
finish.

396
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:59,000
I'm gonna let you finish Thanks, Kanye

397
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:05,000
I think that Occam's razor only works
with what the quote is, right? With all

398
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:11,000
things considered, with all things being
equal, the simplest explanation tends to

399
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:17,000
be the most correct one. You not all
things are equal because there's too many

400
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:23,000
question marks here about exactly what is
on the table here. So it's not being

401
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:29,000
objective. It's kind of being subjective
to what you're and again, that's why I

402
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:35,000
said I am speculating as well.

403
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Correct.

404
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
You can't use Occam's razor here. At
least to me can't use that because not all

405
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
is equal.

406
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Fair enough.

407
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Go ahead. You finish. You finish.

408
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:48,000
You finish. We'll go with the simplest
solution here is usually what I've seen

409
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:53,000
work with him. And this is, so my thought
is that most of the stuff that he does is

410
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:58,000
in line with some sort of idea that he has
to benefit himself. And most of the things

411
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:03,000
I've seen as well while they may appear to
benefit larger groups as a whole, are

412
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:08,000
still benefiting himself, and perhaps that
was the main reason to do it, or perhaps

413
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:13,000
the idea was presented to him and he goes
along with it because it would also

414
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:18,000
benefit himself. So, I mean, if that's his
personality or whatever, that he's a

415
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:23,000
businessman, of course, you're going to
want to do things to benefit yourself. I

416
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:28,000
don't know if that should be done from the
office of the presidency, but whatever. My

417
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:33,000
worry is that if you listen to him...

418
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Your worry is that Doge is going to go
after your budget. That's your worry, OK,

419
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
qx()? I know, I know.

420
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:46,000
We're private. We're a land-grant
institution. We do have some funds, but

421
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:51,000
it's mainly a private institution. Anyway,
so if you remember when he was talking

422
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:56,000
about when people were asking him
questions about the Trump coin, right?

423
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:01,000
When it spiked to like $34 or $43 billion,
whatever the hell it was. Now, there are

424
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:06,000
two ways you can interpret what he said,
right? He looked at them, or he didn't

425
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:11,000
even look. I think he was signing stuff at
the desk at the Oval Office. And he said,

426
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:16,000
34 billion, 43 billion? Oh, that's nothing
compared to, I don't know if he stopped a

427
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:21,000
sentence or he made it indicate that
that's nothing yet kind of thing. Either

428
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:26,000
he's being, you know, being what he's been
before where he's, you know, pompous and

429
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:31,000
was like, Oh, that's nothing. That's
barely anything, you know, kind of thing.

430
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Or he's, there's some serious plans in his
head to make a decent amount of money.

431
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Right.

432
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:53,000
And why Greenland it's, I mean, it's,
it's how much is the GDP of Greenland?

433
00:36:53,000 --> 00:37:01,000
I don't know. What is it? Let's look. 3.2
billion.

434
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Exactly. Exactly. Listen, I think we're
running pretty short on time. Let's get

435
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
3.2 billion.

436
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Yeah. Yeah.

437
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
But I didn't buy like 15 Greenlands.

438
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Yeah. So all I'm all I'm saying, all I'm
saying is that something like something

439
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:19,000
like Ergo exists outside of these walls,
right? Something like Ergo. Well, Ergo

440
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:23,000
would benefit, of course, like all other
cryptos. If Trump had some deregulation or

441
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,000
even, you know, It'd be fantastic if at
least some more clarity and more defined

442
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,000
guidelines and boundaries and rules would
come out on the US for crypto instead of

443
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,000
what we've had for the last x years where
who knows if you're breaking the rules,

444
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:39,000
right? Who knows if you're doing this? So
that's a positive step, right? Let's get

445
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,000
some clear things in place of how things
are done and what we do. Ergo will benefit

446
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,000
from that stuff as well as even if Trump
starts a Bitcoin reserve and starts

447
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:51,000
pumping into that, Ergo is going to
benefit from that. All ships are going to

448
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,000
rise in crypto. Yeah, gotcha. But the
point I'm trying to make, Dan, is that

449
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Ergo can survive without that, right? Ergo
can survive in a state of privacy because

450
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,000
it's optional. We're deregulated,
essentially decentralized, because anybody

451
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,000
can run a node in any country with just a
small computer. We have amazing open

452
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:11,000
source tooling that anybody can jump onto
and use. So when I see these storms out

453
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:15,000
there that are rip roaring and people like
Trump are ripping up, not ripping up, but

454
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,000
moving around and getting hyped up for the
crypto markets and that kind of thing,

455
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Yeah, that's great, but I feel like here
we are in our Ergo Juggernaut and any of

456
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,000
these storms, while it may rock the boat a
little bit, it's, you know, it's just a

457
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Thursday night storm for Ergo. You know,
no big deal. We can, you know, we'll

458
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:35,000
persevere through everything. That's what
it's built for, I guess is my ending point

459
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:39,000
there, Dan.

460
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Well, and that's a good point And i'm
sorry that happened or i'm very happy for

461
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:04,000
you All right.

462
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Let's get a question. What do we have?
And oh we got here we go. This is a good

463
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:14,000
one Mohammed esmer Our favorite
non-favorite person who likes to trash who

464
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:19,000
guys has gotten banned from main chat like
300 times He says qx() and daniel argue

465
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:24,000
alive about who is a better pronokia. So
he's calling us a liar So I don't know

466
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:29,000
about what maybe about the positivity i
go, but I want to take this chance to

467
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:34,000
remind people that while Ergo is an open
ecosystem and it's free to use anybody can

468
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:39,000
use it you know do what they want with it
take as much control as they want to

469
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:44,000
federated social platforms are not Discord
is not Telegram is not so if somebody like

470
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Mohammed's going to come on there and not
provide proper discourse, not have

471
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:54,000
conversations, but have agendas to fud or
do anything like this, you bet your ass

472
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:59,000
the owner of those federated systems is
going to hold them accountable for the

473
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:04,000
guidelines of the chats and they're going
to be kicked out. be prepared for that

474
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:09,000
folks we had a prominent member of the
ecosystem that was kicked out for their

475
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:14,000
behavior a couple weeks ago and it still
does not ring well with them and they just

476
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:19,000
cannot understand the difference between
open systems and federated systems which

477
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:24,000
is really funny because of what they were
working on so if you if you don't like the

478
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Ergo chats if you don't like You know,
being held to community rules, which I

479
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:34,000
will say are so much looser than any other
crypto chats I've been in ever. Ergo

480
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:39,000
allows so much fud as a form of discourse
going in there, right? I mean, you've been

481
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:44,000
in there, Dan, right? Like people are
allowed to speak their mind and we chat

482
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:49,000
about it and we like challenges. So you're
already at a very loose space in a

483
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:54,000
federated chat with community guidelines.

484
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Just be aware of that, guys. Was that
prominent community member you, qx()?

485
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
No, I won't mention a name. The
Sigmanauts know we were discussing it the

486
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
other day.

487
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Okay. Well, it's probably you. Yes. But
anyway, let's get to maybe one or two real

488
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:13,000
questions before we sign off for the
evening. Let's see. Oh, and sub-blocks,

489
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:18,000
you know?

490
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Oh, is that Pulsar? Pulsar, it's so good
to see you. Pulsar's been busy in real

491
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:30,000
life, so it's nice to have him pop in
here. Soon, Pulsar. So the epics are out

492
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:36,000
of the way. The voting has been done, I
think, on testnet to get that node there.

493
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:42,000
So that was a holdup with what they're
testing on. So more testing there. I guess

494
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:48,000
we're at that stage from what we were
waiting on a while ago. So soon. It's

495
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:54,000
moving, Pulsar. It's moving. Maybe you
should help kushti Pulsar. Pulsar is an

496
00:41:54,000 --> 00:42:00,000
expert in, I think it's C sharp, is it? I
can't remember, but he rewrote He rewrote

497
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:06,000
FleetSDK to FleetSharp so that there's
more options of programming against Ergo

498
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:12,000
libraries, which is fantastic. Pulsar,
you're my hero. All right, next question.

499
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Okay, we got one from Wendy Moon. Do you
think it would make sense to promote Ergo

500
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:26,000
platforms to non-crypto folks using
terminology other than crypto? because

501
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:32,000
every person is losing trust in crypto
thanks to meme scams. So, okay, well, let

502
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:38,000
me just throw kind of like my 25 cents of
thing in here, and then you can follow up

503
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:44,000
on the qx(), because-

504
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Oh, I will. I'll follow up, Dan.

505
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Yeah, you just keep talking and talking.
Anyway, so my feeling and this is not just

506
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:56,000
for Ergo I think you know the same thing
comes up in Cardano as well and others

507
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:01,000
like when marketing when marketing when
you know when mainstream marketing and

508
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:06,000
it's like well okay okay so who and i
think i actually spoke about this before

509
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:11,000
who knows who underwriter laboratories are
you will Now, if you're an electronics

510
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:16,000
person, you know exactly what I'm talking
about, but the average consumer, you guys

511
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:21,000
who are the average consumer of
electronics, do you know who underwriter

512
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:26,000
laboratories are? You will.

513
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Another global safety science company
with more than a century of expertise

514
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
innovating safety solutions.

515
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:39,000
They are, but that's the thing. The
average electronic consumer does not know

516
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:45,000
what UL is, but UL is like one of the
backbones of electronic safety in the US,

517
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:51,000
and possibly the world, and have been for
over a century. And why do you not hear

518
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:57,000
about the UL? Because the UL provides a
very, very needed and robust function that

519
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:03,000
other products can be built on or built
against or be benchmarked against. And so

520
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:09,000
while you don't, as a, I mean, they try to
like promote them like back in the day, I

521
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:15,000
think. And in fact, if you look on your
electronics somewhere, you're gonna see

522
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:21,000
the UL logo. But for the main part, you're
not gonna be buying like a Sony TV and

523
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:27,000
somebody's gonna say, oh, well, this is UL
approved. But Sony is not going to ask UL

524
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:33,000
to market their TV for them. They're going
to use UL technology to create a better TV

525
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:39,000
and then market it themselves. So that's
what I think personally and as a business

526
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:45,000
owner and as somebody who's building on
Ergo and Cardano, I think that it's

527
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:51,000
actually the project responsibility to
promote their product versus the ecosystem

528
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:57,000
kind of trying to push them as a project
in the ecosystem. Of course, The support

529
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:03,000
is greatly appreciated and is needed to
sometimes kind of invigorate the ecosystem

530
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:09,000
or prop it up. But I really think that...
it should be up to the project. You know,

531
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:15,000
the project, individual projects building
on Ergo should be out there promoting and

532
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:21,000
talking to the non-crypto people because
those are going to be their users. Just

533
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:27,000
like what we're doing with Palmyra, you
know, I mean, we don't really talk too

534
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:33,000
much about Winter Protocol, which runs on
Ergo. We talk about the utility, you know,

535
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:39,000
and when Theodore, our head of business
development went to Greece a couple of

536
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:45,000
months ago, He had zero conversations
about Ergo there. Zero. He had zero

537
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:51,000
conversations about technology there. He
just, well, I mean, he had, but I mean,

538
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:57,000
what's under the hood type of technology
conversations. What he spoke about is the

539
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:03,000
solution. You know, the solution that will
help these guys be able to export their

540
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:09,000
olive oil and get a better profit on their
olive oil. And yeah, under the hood, it

541
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:15,000
uses blockchain, it uses Ergo. But in the
end, the solution is what we offered them.

542
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:21,000
And nobody had any questions. Nobody was
asking. Oh, well, wait a second. How does

543
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:27,000
the blockchain do stuff here? It's like,
well, they don't care. They just know that

544
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:33,000
they can use this thing is going to make
their lives easier. They're going to make

545
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:39,000
more money. That's it. So, yes, I mean,
that's what I think. And like I said, I'm

546
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:45,000
not saying that the ecosystem should not
be doing some sort of a advertising type

547
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:51,000
of thing if there are funds and if that
ecosystem is actually designed for that

548
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:57,000
because some are not. Some are just
designed to be kind of like the tool chest

549
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:03,000
to build on. but, yeah, but I think, I
think if I think that like mainly it's

550
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:09,000
just basically, projects responsibility to
promote the solution that they created. So

551
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:15,000
that's, that's what I think. What do you,
what do you think qx()?

552
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:34,000
You are muted.

553
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
How did that happen?

554
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
That happened when you press the mute
button.

555
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Oh, is that what that does? Oh my
goodness. So what I was lip syncing

556
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:46,000
earlier is that the Ergo Foundation has
been doing this for a long time, right?

557
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:50,000
They've been promoting a grassroots
approach of here's a tool, here's how it

558
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:54,000
works, here's what you can use it for,
here's how you can also build, here's some

559
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:58,000
code you can learn, all that kind of
stuff. So when I parse this out with

560
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,000
current times, I'm thinking that when a
lot of people say marketing and getting

561
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Ergo out there, Who do they mean that
we're trying to get it to? Are we trying

562
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,000
to get it to people that are going to buy
and sell, buy low, sell high, and just

563
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:14,000
price speculate? Or are you talking about,
let's get it out there like things like

564
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Dan's doing, things like I'm doing with my
students, things like other people are

565
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:22,000
doing where you're using utility to make
something and have people use that thing.

566
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:26,000
And yeah, they may know that it's Ergo,
they may not, but you're using the

567
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:30,000
product. We specifically went with
Tipperbot at Cornell because I'm not going

568
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:34,000
to sit there and try to explain to people
what a wallet is, how to use it. You know,

569
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:38,000
a thousand students, I'm not going to sit
there and say, here's how you do this,

570
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:42,000
here's how you do that. Instead, it's just
like, Here's what we're doing. If you want

571
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,000
a free plot then sign up for this and
you'll get tipped and you'll go from

572
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:50,000
there. So building systems around Ergo
that people don't necessarily have to

573
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:54,000
know. So I think Ergo Foundation's been
doing that and that's what a lot of people

574
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:58,000
don't like because they want the other
type of marketing which is let's get

575
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:02,000
people in here to just buy and not
utilize. So it's I don't know, Dan. It's

576
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:06,000
tough. You definitely need a... Those are
two different teams, right? There's a team

577
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,000
for that and then there's a team for what
the EF has been doing as far as promoting

578
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:14,000
utility and usage of the chain. So I don't
really have a better answer than what I

579
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:18,000
just spouted.

580
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:37,000
I think that's fair. That's a fair
answer. Like I said, some ecosystems are

581
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:42,000
not... They're not VC ecosystems where
it's just basically, it's really not about

582
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:47,000
the tooling as much as it is about pumping
the price and having the Silicon Valley

583
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:52,000
approach to marketing that we're trying to
get away in a way. And so yeah, so these

584
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:57,000
guys are gonna pump the price and they're
gonna they're gonna fill their ecosystem

585
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:02,000
with bullshit and but it's gonna be big,
you know Yeah, a lot of these guys are

586
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:07,000
pumping first utility later, right?

587
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,000
That's like let's let's get the money in
and we'll figure out how to fix issues

588
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Ergo wasn't born like that.

589
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Ergo was born with the utility, you know,
so we can't expect it to become that now,

590
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:24,000
like I said, I'm not diminishing the need
for exposure. Correct. But we have to

591
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:28,000
understand.

592
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,000
We just need to be conscious of what
we're looking for, how we go about it.

593
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:38,000
That's exactly it. Who are we advertising
it to? Now, Wendy Moon was talking about

594
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:43,000
not crypto people. Okay, that's good. But
like I said, that, I feel, is more of a

595
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:48,000
project responsibility than, say, the
foundation. but yeah, if you're talking

596
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:53,000
about tooling, then yeah, that's, that's
something that you want to market to maybe

597
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:58,000
developers, you know, obviously, or
somebody's, you know, somebody's designing

598
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:03,000
a project. And again, that's a different
type of marketing.

599
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Well, my 17 year old child wrote me two
days ago when they were at school and

600
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:16,000
said, hey dad, thanks for being terrible.
Well, they didn't say that, just kidding.

601
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:20,000
They said, they've been speaking to me off
and on about their economics teacher who

602
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:24,000
is very anti-crypto, right? So the the
economics teacher is giving the same old

603
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:28,000
tired arguments of oh It's money from
nothing and there's no value and it's a

604
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:32,000
bunch of scams Okay, I get it. You know,
those are the things that we get from

605
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:36,000
those kind of uninformed people So they're
asking a question they send a bunch of

606
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:40,000
texts from an email right up that the
person economics professor did about their

607
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:44,000
latest chapter and about crypto, so I gave
it a nice rebuttal and just you know with

608
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:48,000
those kind of things it's simple it's like
you talk about what putting a value what

609
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:52,000
it means to create a financial system
right and how how's gold or dollar you

610
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:56,000
know any different in value putting in
besides it's propping up markets right now

611
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:00,000
right that's the only thing they have but
initially we people put value on objects

612
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,000
or things or or or monies right same with
crypto and then explaining to them that

613
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:08,000
The proof of work crypto actually takes a
conversion of energy to create a store of

614
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:12,000
value as well. And then I got into a brief
discussion with them about inflationary

615
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:16,000
measures, right? And how if there's an
issue in the US, we just turn on the

616
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:20,000
printing machine and print more dollars to
pay for it. thus increasing prices across

617
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:24,000
the board for everything. And not just
naturally increase. When large

618
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:28,000
corporations see inflation going right,
they jack their prices up before it even

619
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:32,000
happens. It's like this preemptive thing
of an excuse to jack up your prices. So

620
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:36,000
it's all like some snowball avalanche
effect. So spoke about that, and my child

621
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:40,000
was actually ill. That kind of makes
sense. So I forgot to write, but I was

622
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:44,000
going to say, hey, if you want somebody to
come in and and debate with him in class

623
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:48,000
about it and chat about what they might be
happy to. I think that'd be a lot of fun.

624
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:52,000
But so that brings me hope that the young
generation at least can be like, oh, you

625
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:56,000
know, that does kind of seem stupid that
we just continue to print our own money,

626
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:00,000
you know, out of thin air. And then people
say that crypto has no real value.

627
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:32,000
You're like, OK, you're well, it's
basically like you said, it's basically

628
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:37,000
people don't understand the core concept
of why money has value. You know why yeah,

629
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:42,000
I'd have value any kind of perceived value
So that's that's definitely You know,

630
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:47,000
that's definitely a big deal because it's
just not that's it comes from lack of

631
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:52,000
understanding of their own, you know field
of expertise but anyway, Speaking to Wendy

632
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:57,000
one last time then I I think with Ergo and
with any chain that has utility, you're

633
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:02,000
going to see adoption by everyday people,
by things like Dan. Maybe there are even

634
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:07,000
services that are centralized that are
using decentralized tools. You could

635
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:12,000
create a service that Is it like right we
have like last pass right it stores all of

636
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:17,000
your freaking passwords all in their
security enclave? And you just know your

637
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:22,000
one big password things like that could
exist for Ergo for multiple wallets and

638
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:27,000
exchanges and things like that or any
crypto You know nothing I would use the

639
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:32,000
hell that I'm gonna put my seed phrase on
some server the only place my seed phrase

640
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:37,000
is public is Luis Vatra's tipper bot right
that's the only place that my seed phrase

641
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:42,000
exists online for the Tipperbot wallet.
But other people may be comfortable doing

642
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:47,000
that. They might want that security. And
with that cost comes an extra cost,

643
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:52,000
perhaps. And then with that comes like
insurance for, you know, scams that they

644
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:57,000
go through. So all this kind of stuff can
be built on top of what we have already on

645
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Ergo or any other chain that takes utility
and actually building seriously. So we'll

646
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:07,000
get there, Wendy. I think we'll get there.
Yeah.

647
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:15,000
We will we will all right well, I need to
wrap it up for today cuz actually I got

648
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:19,000
another it's only like 11 o'clock Dan
Yeah, but I got I get a I get a space

649
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Coming up time how long?

650
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:29,000
Pretty soon and before that I have to do
stuff.

651
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Oh Honey, do this all right. What else do
we have any other questions in here real

652
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:37,000
quick?

653
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Let's see

654
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Nothing that can't be asked in chat. Oh,
we got a brand new segment. Oh, here we

655
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:53,000
go. Hi, brand new segment out here.
Welcome Rich. What is my best way to, what

656
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:58,000
is my best bet? Present my ideas, but
protect my IP. I'm looking to meet and

657
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:03,000
safely give my team ideas slash work. Do
you mean an Ergo Rich? So it's,

658
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:10,000
Yeah, that's a tough question. So, you
know, Ergo embraces open source, but we

659
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:15,000
also have a mix of open source and closed
source. You'll find a lot like people will

660
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:20,000
write smart contracts that are open
source, right? So like Spectrum, like

661
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:25,000
MewFinance, like DuckPools, right?
Contracts are open source. But then they

662
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:30,000
closed source their UI, which is their
unique blend of that kind of thing. So I

663
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:35,000
would say if that's what you're asking,
you can do, and you still want to be as

664
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:40,000
open source as you can in the Ergo
ecosystem, You if you're closing anything

665
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:45,000
off you need to provide innovation in that
closeness, right? So let's say you create

666
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:50,000
a tool or tooling the open source of
contracts and you have some whiz bang UI

667
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:55,000
that you're hosting it costs resources to
host and You're doing that but then

668
00:56:55,000 --> 00:57:00,000
perhaps you can also offer some you know
open source version of that earlier

669
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:05,000
version beta UI that can be on on GitHub
that somebody could download and run your

670
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:10,000
app themselves without having to rely on
your web server. So there's blends of that

671
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:15,000
kind of thing. But it is a tough question,
Dan, right? How do you protect your IP

672
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:20,000
when we're in a fully open source place
where anybody could take your stuff and

673
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:25,000
run with it and do better than you at it?
It's a tough one. Overall, it makes the

674
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:30,000
space better. It does. But there are ways,
Rich, that you can still, I mean, closed

675
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:35,000
stuff in Ergo isn't shunned. You know,
people, it's just about expectations. And

676
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:40,000
what's the word I'm looking for?
Trade-offs.

677
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Trade-offs. It's all about trade-offs.

678
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Yeah, trade-offs. But be transparent
about it, Rich. If you're building

679
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:54,000
something and you publish some of it and
you don't publish the other stuff, don't

680
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:58,000
hide it. Say this is what we're doing. We
feel this early on if we release our UI to

681
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:02,000
everybody, somebody can easily take over
and blow all the hard work we've done. So

682
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:06,000
we're going to keep our UI private until
version 3 then maybe open source version 1

683
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:10,000
UI on top of the open source smart
contracts that we've done in two years or

684
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:14,000
something like that so there's definitely
options out there and like I say before

685
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:18,000
With Ergo, at least, with things like
Nautilus, I can interact with closed

686
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:22,000
source systems like closed source UIs. And
I can still see everything that's going

687
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:26,000
on. I can look at that information in the
advanced mode in Nautilus. And I can see,

688
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:30,000
OK, here are all my outputs. Here are all
my inputs. And I'll see what's going on.

689
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:34,000
So even when interacting with those kind
of things, still as the user, I have other

690
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:38,000
tools that allow me to exactly see if I'm
going to be scammed or messed with or

691
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:42,000
anything like that. All right, Dan.

692
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Agreed. All right. Well. Are we good?

693
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
We're good, Dan. We're good. I mean, you
came 15 minutes late, and we're leaving

694
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
five minutes early from that. So you owe
us five minutes in some other time. So you

695
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
got to make it up.

696
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:06,000
I'll do it in some other time. I'll do it
at IHOP.

697
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:09,000
That sounds good, Dan. I'll give you an
extra five minutes at IHOP.

698
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:14,000
Speaking of IHOP, their competitor,
Waffle House, is charging $0.30 extra an

699
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:19,000
egg. Or is it $0.50 extra an egg? Would
IHOP ever do that, Dan?

700
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
IHOP not.

701
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
That's clever. Good way to end it.
Everybody, have a great week. Thanks for

702
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
joining us.

703
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:29,000
Thanks a lot, everyone. See you next
week.
