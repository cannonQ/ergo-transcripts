1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I guess, the payment structure. I think
we're going to have a free tier. But of

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
course, the rest of the code is free. So
if you want to set up your own Open Web

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
UI, you're more than welcome to do so.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:24,000
All right, and so what are the main use
cases for the current indexes? So is it

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:33,000
for like intelligence? Like analyzing the
blockchain?

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Yeah, I'm hoping to create sort of agents
that were able to maybe say, hey, set up a

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
grid trading bot for me and then analyze
the data for like the last couple of days,

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
look at the grid trading bots and say,
hey, okay, we're doing pretty well. Maybe

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
let's update it, put more money into the
grid trading bot for a specific pair or be

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
able to spend the boxes itself on say the
Spectrum Finance. So be able to say, hey,

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
go ahead and buy a specific pair. Maybe
some sort of update recursively, like

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
every hour it checks, hey, should I buy,
sell, hold, and sort of do that sort of

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
mechanism. So allow the agents to be able
to operate on chain per the prompt.

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:30,000
That's interesting. It would be good to
get some applications generated by just

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:38,000
prompting the LLM.

16
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Absolutely. That's the next step, but we
need to consider some initial

17
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
applications.

18
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:53,000
But, yeah, it would be good to get, I
don't know, like a new oracle pool, for

19
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:01,000
example, config for it with just one or
two prompts. So, to get data, some API

20
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:09,000
client or scraper for some data, that's
usually about just a few lines of code.

21
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:17,000
And getting Oracle Pool config done, so
we'll set the number of participants and

22
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:25,000
so on. That's what we are discussing for
the upcoming version 2 of USD Oracle Pool.

23
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:33,000
What should be number of participants and
so on? But then, in this case, we have

24
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:41,000
quite complicated update procedure from
version one to version two. And in case of

25
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:49,000
generating a new pool, it would be good to
have LLM generating a config. And then we

26
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:57,000
can do more like generate stable coins,
because it's mostly about using a new

27
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Oracle and maybe tweaking parameters.
Then, yeah, people may do some stable

28
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:13,000
coins.

29
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:24,000
More stable and then some tooling like
options which could be nice because

30
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:33,000
originally options were created for
raising funds for agriculture industry,

31
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:42,000
for farmers. But, it's quite complicated
instrument it was. It used to be so only

32
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:51,000
banksters can do options, and you need to
have some big experience and so on to

33
00:03:51,000 --> 00:04:00,000
write down a first option. But then, with
LLM, maybe it would be possible to avoid

34
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:09,000
intermediaries. So, a farmer can just
generate an option and launch it

35
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:18,000
immediately on chain instead of dealing
with banksters and paying a lot of money

36
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:27,000
for that.

37
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
What's the resource requirements for
setting up something like that?

38
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:44,000
So, I think there is some that the base
with scenarios. So, what's our parameters?

39
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:56,000
But here, maybe, in case if it's possible
to fit a quite big database to a LLM, it

40
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:08,000
could be better than a human in writing
options, because after all it's not

41
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:20,000
that... there is nothing magic here, it's
not that complicated task for LLM.

42
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Shouldn't be complicated, shouldn't be
doable.

43
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:41,000
And they have an MCP. So an MCP server
for databases already. So like, for

44
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:47,000
example, there's one for Postgres. And so
you'll be able to facilitate, you know,

45
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:53,000
say, hey, what's in this data? Let's just
generally analyze it and then just give it

46
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:59,000
sort of those, with the database name, all
the APIs keys and things like that, and

47
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:05,000
should be able to kind of parse that out
in a lot easier fashion. I'm not sure what

48
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:11,000
database you mentioned, but I would
imagine they probably have one for that.

49
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:20,000
All right. How's the mining pool doing?
Sigmanauts mining pool.

50
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Yeah, we're doing good. Let's see, I
think we're right about 90 GHz at the

51
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
moment. I'm currently working on updating
the web page for us. So kind of, we kind

52
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
of were thinking, you know, this is sort
of like the first sort of look for new

53
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
miners. And so we really need to have
something a little bit more polished for

54
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
our website. And so I'm working on
updating it. We have like the prototype in

55
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
terms of UI and UX done. So now it's just
working on the backend. And so I used

56
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
lovable.dev to generate the front end and
then from there working with Cursor to

57
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
facilitate the backend integration with
the APIs from our mining pool that we

58
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
have. So hopefully within a couple weeks
we'll have that up and running and ready

59
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
to go.

60
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Yeah, we're just mining away. Going to
reach out to a couple other YouTube

61
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
miners, see if we can get them on the
peer-to-peer podcast and talk about

62
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,000
mining, because it seems a lot of talk
lately. Ergo is the last refuge for GPU

63
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,000
miners, and so I'd like to capitalize on
that sort of idea. You know, it's a great

64
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
place to be, great place to mine,
especially with demurrage. We handed out

65
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000
over 150 ERGs this last week with
demurrage rewards. Then of course, we've

66
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
got the bonus rewards coming through as
well. So definitely we have the incentive

67
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
there to mine to our pool compared to any
other pool on Ergo, just because of the

68
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
fact, let alone we have demurrage as well
as the bonus tokens.

69
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:18,000
All right nice nice so from my side so
preparing 6.0 release now syncing with the

70
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:30,000
mainnet and fixing some issues on the way
so hard to predict when mainnet ready, 6.0

71
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:42,000
would be released, so now we're messing
with a little bit obscure issue. A bit

72
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:54,000
hard to predict, but anyway, it's close
and then we will start working with the

73
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:06,000
mining pools on getting activation,
setting activation date and informing

74
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:18,000
mining pools about the upcoming votes for
protocol update, soft fork, 6.0 soft fork.

75
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Then, yeah, so for sub-blocks,
peer-to-peer logic initial version is

76
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:38,000
done, so in a few days we'll invite maybe
one or two folks to participate testing

77
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:48,000
devnet now with some peer-to-peer layer so
there is need for just like two or three

78
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:58,000
people there to update the nodes
constantly because it's still super raw

79
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:08,000
and so on but yeah there is progress there
aside of that there is upcoming 5026 not

80
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:18,000
released now with long-awaited feature of
Candidate Regeneration so it would allow

81
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:28,000
for faster confirmation of transactions.
So with Hardchains transaction we'll get

82
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:38,000
into the next block. And then, a lot of
other fixes and small improvements there.

83
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:48,000
So hopefully it will be released next
week.

84
00:10:50,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Then, yeah, a good report from MewFinance
and there are a lot of updates in the

85
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:10,000
ecosystem towards unrolling new releases
and so on. Then yeah I personally

86
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:20,000
published a couple of new schemes on the
forum. Maybe LLM would be quite useful

87
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:30,000
there as well for launching, for example,
off-chain monetary systems for

88
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:40,000
communities. But yeah, we need first to
find how to do that manually.

89
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Yeah, it should be standardized in some
way and how you set up off-chain bots.

90
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Then, yeah, a lot of updates in regards
with development and a lot of talks, so a

91
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:22,000
lot of new contributors recently, so a lot
of talks about what's that doing so yeah a

92
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:36,000
lot of interesting things check developers
chats and so on if you're interested.

93
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,000
So I have a question for you about
sub-blocks. How would the mempool work

94
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,000
with sub-blocks being really quick
confirmation times? Would there be sort of

95
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,000
this new idea with the mempool where, you
know, because obviously they wouldn't be

96
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,000
there that long for the confirmation. So
is there going to be like a need to enter

97
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,000
mediary between like the mempool and like
confirmed or how does that work?

98
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:16,000
So in some regard, yeah, so sub-blocks
providing confirmations but with a higher

99
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:27,000
rate of orphans, much higher rate,
obviously. You may expect more rollbacks,

100
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:38,000
so mempool would kind of buffer anyway
when you are doing from one sub-block to

101
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:49,000
another transactions are getting back to
pool when you're applying new transactions

102
00:13:49,000 --> 00:14:00,000
but new from a better chain but a
sub-block chain but it could be that some

103
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:11,000
transaction old fork would sit in the
mempool waiting for newer blocks. So,

104
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:22,000
yeah, it's more the same mechanics but
yeah, now, higher speed. So, there would

105
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:33,000
be a need to have bigger memory usage
sub-blocks memory on mempool because they

106
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:44,000
are in some sense about more same after
blocks so you are putting with a mempool

107
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:55,000
sub-blocks. And yeah, mempool would be
smaller now.

108
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Right. Yeah, that's kind of what I was
thinking.

109
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Because some algorithms are deficient in
the mempool, so it would be good for a

110
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:34,000
smaller pool. So I think it could be not
that efficient in comparison with having

111
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:45,000
transactions in sub-block.

112
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,000
All right, gotcha. But I would imagine so
with sub-blocks, we're probably going to

113
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,000
get new APIs to be able to call or are we
going to have the same APIs from the node

114
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,000
in the index nodes?

115
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:24,000
There will be new APIs and some methods
already implemented, but yeah just two or

116
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:47,000
three. So it's a very initial API. So in
the first place, the fault would be on

117
00:16:47,000 --> 00:17:10,000
peer-to-peer and then on API for extra
indices that's still open.

118
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:21,000
So yeah, let me open the questions also.
Do we have anything there? Oh, second.

119
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
It looks like we have some in the chat.

120
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:38,000
With the global economy looking like it
is looking like it's in for a tough time

121
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:51,000
do you think this will hurt or help
crypto? I have no idea what do you think?

122
00:17:51,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Yeah so about crypto should help Ergo it's
contra cyclical. The problem is that

123
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:17,000
currently the Ergo in my opinion kind of
trapped so it's considered crypto and

124
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:30,000
crypto is 99 percent useless. It has some
pro-cyclical value but yeah mostly more

125
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:43,000
for buying bitcoin and monero using to
bypass using bitcoin for him or holding

126
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:56,000
and I think now also monero maybe some
there is even Proof-of-Work will tell

127
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:09,000
about some foreign fans now looking for
work beyond Bitcoin and so on.

128
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Kind of activity with that exact so in
TTC so our crypto cards should be in and

129
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:37,000
should help better money in turbulent
times so we have only kind of passive

130
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:51,000
digital gold. So Bitcoin and Ergo, was
positioned initially as presentations back

131
00:19:51,000 --> 00:20:05,000
in September, October 2019 as digital gold
with contracts. So digital gold with an

132
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:19,000
ability to create trust. derivative
instruments on top of it, then it's

133
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:33,000
possible to do expansion to produce better
for the real world. To connect, so, like,

134
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:47,000
all IOUs, so, created, all IOUs created
within some T, with chain reserves. But

135
00:20:47,000 --> 00:21:01,000
different economic is connected. So that's
possible with ergobots. Yeah, the problem

136
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:15,000
is cognition now, I believe. So people are
considering that there is crypto is doing

137
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:29,000
something but what exactly I know for the
proposition crypto that these days aside

138
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:43,000
of just speculative creation assets some
assets so yeah but but it's hopefully now

139
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:57,000
tens of different entities around the
globe so let's see it's anything but yeah

140
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:11,000
it's time it's time for Ergo to get
recognized.

141
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:21,000
So we got another question. What sort of
applications do you think will benefit

142
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:27,000
from sub-blocks?

143
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Exchange, I think like DEX and so on.

144
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Yeah, totally. It's general transactions.
You don't have to wait for like three

145
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
minutes.

146
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Yeah maybe on ramp so you don't have it
for minutes when you are with this person

147
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:09,000
in the f-rides, for example, you don't
need to try it for minutes. Yeah. A forum

148
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:21,000
post on what to do for such deals rather
than with sub-blocks. It's also quite

149
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:33,000
fancy. You can meet someone to get a bit
exchanged for cash and then you can get

150
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:45,000
ERGs immediately with sub-blocks and not
RSBTC but yeah basically it's payton RSBTC

151
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:57,000
from locked UTXO if no proof for bitcoin
transfer is printed within certain time

152
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:09,000
frame like six hours for example 12 hours
so the worst lock time I've the bitcoin

153
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:21,000
chain out four hours I believe, but often
you need to wait for two hours. It's quite

154
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:33,000
often. Bitcoin, blockchain or when you
exchange cash for Bitcoin, wait for

155
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:45,000
confirmation. Yeah, it's quite painful.

156
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
So everything should be a lot faster from
like Rosen to sending TXs, you know, even,

157
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
I guess our mining pool when we
distribute, everything will be a lot, lot

158
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,000
faster.

159
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Yeah, otherwise I'm here because it seems
that there for quite a long time to

160
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:22,000
exclude any security on the blockchain. So
it's about Ergo.

161
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
There should still be something like
speed up though. I mean, just from a TX

162
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,000
perspective, like once they're done with
the security aspects and like, you know,

163
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
just from like, I would imagine maybe it's
minimal, just from like, I don't really

164
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,000
know what goes on behind the scenes, but I
would imagine just because you can

165
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,000
transact factor faster, at least on the
Ergo side, it'll be a little bit faster,

166
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
maybe not super noticeable.

167
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Yeah, let's see. So, yeah, maybe it helps
a bit. In regards with mining pools, I'm

168
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:08,000
not sure, it's probably the same. So, I
don't know, the Sigmanauts mining pools

169
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:17,000
specifically. But for others, it's usually
just like few actions with two inputs and

170
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:26,000
very many outputs linked to mine and
they're doing such transactions I don't

171
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:35,000
know like twice a day something like that
and then yeah I mean from sub not getting

172
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:44,000
that much so you just transactions to the
network and they get into payments would

173
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:53,000
be a lot faster for sure. In a few minutes
and yeah, if it's not a few minutes but

174
00:26:53,000 --> 00:27:02,000
faster, I mean, it's the same. Most of the
menus are not for payments, like every few

175
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:11,000
seconds. Every few minutes even, so
they're checking like once a day, so maybe

176
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:20,000
it's more or less the same after all. But
yeah for trade and so on it's better and

177
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:29,000
there were some games which now could be
revived like one it's by Hayley with some

178
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:38,000
kind of thing it could be revived on some
blocks I believe something like that.

179
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Okay. Yeah. I think that, like you said,
like, you know, an on-ramp system would be

180
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:56,000
interesting. Like, like Stripe has a
payment system where a lot of people have

181
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:01,000
been using that for their vibe coded games
and things like that, where they put the

182
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:06,000
payment in there, put your credit cards.
It'd be interesting, you know, especially

183
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:11,000
with sub-blocks where you could reduce the
settlement time. be able to use Stripe, be

184
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:16,000
able to build something to on-ramp so then
people pay in USD and then you can send

185
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:21,000
them ERG or whatever they want, maybe
something with Rosen Bridge as well for

186
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:26,000
other specific coins or tokens.

187
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Cool, cool. We have a question. How does
one get started with vibe coding for

188
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:41,000
ErgoTree and React? So I guess for React,
I would probably suggest using cursor, but

189
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:46,000
of course there's other AI agent coding
frameworks that you could use. That's just

190
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:51,000
something I use. You could also just use
the native Anthropic Claude, Claude.com.

191
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:56,000
And so basically, and I would even just
like, you know, look at the landscape. So

192
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Grok is actually really good as well. And
so some LLMs are better than others at

193
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:06,000
doing specific tasks. So I would maybe
kind of think, play around with those sort

194
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,000
of notions. And so sometimes what I like
to do is I'll go in one LLM like Claude

195
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Sonnet 3.7 and say, hey, I need to write a
prompt to do this. So, for example, I

196
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:21,000
wanted to make Sigmanauts mining pool. I
took a screenshot of our current

197
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:26,000
dashboards. I was able to say, hey, grab
all these metrics, understand what they

198
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:31,000
are, make them into a readme document, and
then build some sort of Markdown structure

199
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:36,000
and design of how it works and what we
need. And then write this prompt. I then

200
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,000
took that prompt and put it into
lovable.dev. And then lovable.dev then

201
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:46,000
created and generated the entire UI for me
in UX. And so React, if you wanted to make

202
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:51,000
a webpage, you could do that as well. I
did the same thing with this airdrop tool

203
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:56,000
that I made for like NFTs and tokens so
you can mass distribute that to people. So

204
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:01,000
in short, you can use lovable.dev to maybe
stand up some sort of front end. You can

205
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:06,000
then push that to GitHub, pull that into
Cursor and then develop the backend. So

206
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:11,000
there's a lot of different ways you can
swing with it. And so I would probably

207
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:16,000
suggest sort of come up with a simple
project and then kind of try different

208
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,000
LLMs and kind of see what works for you
and kind of go from there.

209
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:36,000
In terms of ErgoTree, that is something I
think we're kind of still working on. I

210
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:41,000
haven't really been working on that too
specifically, but really what you need

211
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:46,000
there is the context. And so as long as
you have the specific context, so like for

212
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:51,000
ErgoScript, you can give it GitHub repos
that have like legitimate smart contracts.

213
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:56,000
And you could say, hey, this is example
code. This is sort of what I want to do.

214
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:01,000
And then again, also maybe you could say
these example code, make diagrams out of

215
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:06,000
it so it makes sense and make sure it
understands the UTXO model. And this is

216
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:11,000
kind of what we're trying to do with the
Ergo MCP. And so the So it gives the

217
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:16,000
context to the LLM. And then from there,
when you actually prompt it, and it

218
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:21,000
probably won't be a one shot like, hey,
make this contract for like a dead man

219
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:26,000
switch. So if I die, I publish this stuff
to the blockchain. You know, probably it's

220
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:31,000
gonna be some fine tuning, some tweaking,
but I think it could potentially get you

221
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:36,000
maybe 50 to 70% of the way. And then the
rest you can kind of have to test out for

222
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:41,000
yourself. So, but again, I think it's all
about playing around and testing it.

223
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:50,000
I don't know, what are your thoughts?
kushti, have you tried Vibe coding at all?

224
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Any AI tools have you used?

225
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:08,000
So I've tried to do some core
developments using, yeah, Sonnet 3.5 I

226
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:19,000
believe and yeah so it's and yeah I'll try
to to do some comps not but tests actually

227
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:30,000
for ChainCash and so all tests, it's
working very well. We generated some

228
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:41,000
tests, planned for change with just a goal
prompt and it worked immediately. It was a

229
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:52,000
very nice experience. Development, it
seems, it's not computable, so quite

230
00:32:52,000 --> 00:33:03,000
subtle, but you are spending a lot of time
to figure out what's wrong with them. So,

231
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:14,000
yes, it's producing some complicated code.
It's looking okay from the first, but then

232
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:25,000
there are some subtle bugs, actually.

233
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Yeah, it's definitely kind of an art, you
know. Yeah but for tests you know it's

234
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:43,000
working really great so yeah well most of
time I think tests now could be saved and

235
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:52,000
actually it's quite a big time saver
because all tests also are quite

236
00:33:52,000 --> 00:34:01,000
complicated for the load and for the
interpreter. And for cache and DEX, all

237
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:10,000
tests are weathered, but length 3 or 4
lines of code per hour tests easily. It

238
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:19,000
could be because, yeah, you need to
assemble a transaction according to

239
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:28,000
different concerns and so on, then check,
succeed or fail. And then with the help of

240
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:37,000
LLM, you can ask for many hours actually
on that. So yeah, that's quite a great

241
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:46,000
tooling for standard coding, standard
kinds of coding. Yeah, maybe API. I will

242
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:55,000
try to do my API methods. Yeah, for
complicated stuff. Complicated stuff?

243
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Yeah, algorithms are heavier. Yeah, it's
not that good. But yeah, that's quite

244
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:13,000
expected also.

245
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Yeah, and it's like most tools. Not every
tool is a hammer. And so if you treat

246
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:36,000
every tool like it's a hammer, it's bound
to break, it's bound to not work. And so

247
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:42,000
knowing when to use AI and when not to use
AI is definitely a good skill to have. And

248
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:48,000
then I think relative to the more complex
problems, even with ErgoScript, for

249
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:54,000
example, it just doesn't have a lot of the
context that it needs. So for example,

250
00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:00,000
like Python, You know, it was trained on a
lot of Python code within GitHub. There's

251
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:06,000
so much lines on there. Whereas
ErgoScript, there's obviously not too

252
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:12,000
much. And so there is a notion to where
maybe we need to fine tune a specific

253
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:18,000
model so we can train, say, hey, this is
how you make this specific contract. This

254
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:24,000
is how you make this contract. And so
that's something else we're also looking

255
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:30,000
at. I think MCPs might be able to get us
there before we do that. But if somebody

256
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:36,000
else wants to do that, by all means, send
it. We have about 190 ERGs when we're

257
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:42,000
ready to test and generate smart
contracts. And so that we're going to pay

258
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:48,000
some auditors. So once we get there, if we
can pay some folks to audit them, pay them

259
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:54,000
for their time, and then hopefully the
output is sufficient for what we're

260
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:00,000
working with. But only time will tell.

261
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Yeah. So, to add more, you have a lot of
open so applications, open contracts and

262
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:15,000
so on. So, then, it would be very helpful
to LLM to produce ErgoScript LLM. I

263
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:22,000
believe.

264
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, definitely. And I
think from a fine tuning perspective, you

265
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:33,000
know, it's probably sufficient with the
contracts that we have on the chain right

266
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:38,000
now are rather open source. So then that
way, you know, it doesn't sort of get

267
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:43,000
super confused. You can really like hone
in, so to speak on these specific

268
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:48,000
contracts and how they're written and how
they're executed. And so, but but but I

269
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:53,000
guess the problem might be. And so it
could maybe overfit. So, for example, if

270
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:58,000
you have like a pinlock contract, it was
trained on and then you say, hey, make me

271
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:03,000
another pinlock contract with a little bit
more extendedness. It will probably do

272
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:08,000
that really well. But if you try to say,
hey, make me write like a a dead man

273
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:13,000
switch, so to speak. It might not know how
to do that explicitly. But I think the

274
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:18,000
goal isn't to one-shot these smart
contracts. That's not my goal. My goal is

275
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:23,000
to make it 50% to 75% easier to write the
smart contracts. And so if I can get 50%

276
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:28,000
to 75% to say the first draft of the smart
contract, that works for me because then I

277
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:33,000
can finesse it or whatever it needs to do.
Ask kushti, do you write? Hey, what's

278
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:38,000
going on here? So that's sort of my goal.
It sort of speeds up the smart contract

279
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:43,000
timeline of development. And that would be
pretty powerful, I think. So then more

280
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:48,000
folks helps democratize in some sense,
sort of these coding abilities, maybe. And

281
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:53,000
maybe not everybody should be making smart
contracts, I suppose. There's some sort of

282
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:58,000
notion of security and safety, I guess,
with that sort of respect. Would be cool.

283
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:16,000
So somebody else says, let's see. I know
we don't do wash trading or other nonsense

284
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:25,000
like some other chains, but Ergo and
associated dApps have been stress tested

285
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:34,000
at any point. So I'm not sure. Have we
done any sort of stress test? I mean, I

286
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:43,000
know, for example, we've people have tried
to stress test, you know, fitting the most

287
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:52,000
amount within a given box relative to a
given transaction. So like, you know,

288
00:39:52,000 --> 00:40:01,000
sending one input to like 10,000 outputs,
I suppose.

289
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:10,000
How do you stress test the blockchain, I
guess? Stress testing events, but yeah, so

290
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:17,000
for kind of synthetic stress testing, I'm
not aware of. There were a lot of

291
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:24,000
discussions and I think for our
sub-blocks, yeah, there would be needed to

292
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:31,000
do testnet stress testing. But first, we
need to get more realistic testnet

293
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:38,000
apologies, so we'll invite more folks to
the Testnet because, it doesn't make sense

294
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:45,000
to do stress testing. So that's the
problem with many, actually, papers and so

295
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:52,000
on, white papers claiming some high TPS
when you realize what they're doing they

296
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:59,000
just have few nodes or even many nodes
over the same data center and then yeah it

297
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:06,000
doesn't make sense because it's not
looking like a real peer-to-peer network.

298
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:13,000
So first we need to get a little bigger
testing network, but that's doable. And

299
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:20,000
then yeah, we can do stress testing.

300
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Yeah, that'd be cool to do, you know,
especially to, to be able to, I mean, I

301
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,000
think you made a good point. The test net
topology, like say for example, well, if I

302
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:41,000
wanted to test out one input to 10,000
outputs, like where would I even get all

303
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:45,000
the 10,000 addresses? I mean, I guess you
generate them, you know, how would you do

304
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:49,000
that?

305
00:41:50,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Yeah, so for main nets there were some
stress tests for many outputs and one

306
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:12,000
actually broken many notes because of some
back in light clients actually but those

307
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:23,000
light clients then broke full clients and
so and then yeah many pools we're

308
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:34,000
struggling yeah basically not we are
restarting out of memory, but that was

309
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:45,000
like four years ago, so like 2021, it was
some Aneta airdrop. And yeah, after that,

310
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:56,000
the network survived somehow, but yeah,
many nodes were under pressure. And Yeah,

311
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:07,000
after that, we did some fixes. And, after
that, I can't remember. So there were many

312
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:18,000
events like airdrops and yeah, there was
some events when a few thousands of

313
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:29,000
transactions was sent to the network at
one shot, but yeah, everything was sitting

314
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:40,000
smoothly by the network as well.

315
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Yeah. Yeah. In terms of test net, I would
love to set up a Sigmanauts mining pool

316
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:53,000
test net, and then that would be kind of
interesting. Easier to set up maybe, I

317
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:57,000
don't know.

318
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Let's see, so we got a couple questions
on sub-blocks. So will sub-blocks affect

319
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:13,000
scalability? You know, what if one billion
people are using Ergo and then can

320
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:20,000
sub-blocks TXs be chained within a single
block? Yeah, so can sub-blocks TXs be

321
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:27,000
changed within a single block?

322
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Yeah, but so transactions can be chained
in a single sub-block. And yes, single

323
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:46,000
block also, because yeah, a block would be
just a sequence of sub-blocks mostly for

324
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:55,000
most of transactions. But, yeah, about
billions of people. So still there is need

325
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:04,000
for layer 2s and not just because of TPS.
So I think that would be quite natural

326
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:13,000
design. So today I tweeted diagram of how
our Hawala system works, conceptually. So

327
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:22,000
it's about, you know, some global network
and then local segments are connected to

328
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:31,000
Hawala, Hawala, so local exchange booth.
So, yeah, I believe it should be the same

329
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:40,000
here when you have some local segment,
which is mostly exchanging. with people,

330
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:49,000
actors, agents, mostly exchanging within
this segment. So they need for some

331
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:58,000
off-chain solution. There is no need for
global consensus. When you buy coffee from

332
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:07,000
some local supplier, I mean, why? Why do
you need for global consensus? Why some?

333
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Why some miner in Argentina and some Ergo
enthusiast in Vietnam India or China

334
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:25,000
should know about that even so such
economic activity Should be localized I

335
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:34,000
believe ledger wise also and then yeah I
know for global consensus, we need to have

336
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:43,000
some, I don't know, events which are
really needed there on the global level.

337
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Yeah, it makes a lot of sense. I haven't
really thought about it in terms of the

338
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:57,000
global consensus sort of versus like
local. That's a good way to put that

339
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:01,000
because I mean totally like why you know
from a local you know I am buying coffee

340
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:05,000
like why does the global Ergo chain kind
of care about that you know what I mean

341
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:09,000
it's like yeah just do it off chain and
then you know have that sort of segment do

342
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:13,000
that that makes a lot of sense.

343
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Yeah I mean maybe there is need for some
settlements and clearing between different

344
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:29,000
local segments and so on and then yeah
there is need for global consensus. There

345
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:36,000
is need for global consensus maybe in
regards with some global events and so on

346
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:43,000
but yeah for For most of activities, like
real world activities, I believe there is

347
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:50,000
no need for global consensus, so he
immediately did a global consensus. So

348
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:57,000
there is no need to write that you bought
a cup of coffee from some local supplier.

349
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Yeah, absolutely.

350
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Yeah, that doesn't make sense
economically even, not technically even.

351
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Yeah, I mean, even in the United States,
we've got the federal government, but then

352
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:27,000
we also have our local governments and
then our city governments. So it makes

353
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:33,000
sense. The federal government doesn't
really care what we do, so to speak, on

354
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:39,000
certain local perspectives. So it makes
sense to, as we scale up, we continue to

355
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:45,000
offload specific aspects to these other
layers.

356
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:49,000
All right. So one more question.

357
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Looks like, let's see, how can both Ergo
and Cardano collaborate with each other

358
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:03,000
from a transaction happen on the chain, on
the respective chain? So I guess we're

359
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:10,000
kind of doing that with Rosen Bridge.

360
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Yeah, but what I thought about actually
is can we have multi-chain Hydra, for

361
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:28,000
example. And as Cardano is supporting the
elliptic curve used in Ergo, secp256k1, I

362
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:37,000
guess that's doable in some form. I need
to recheck the Hydra paper. But that would

363
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:46,000
be quite interesting when you may have
some off-chain high-speed rails basically

364
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:55,000
for financial and not just financial
transactions, powered from both the chains

365
00:49:55,000 --> 00:50:04,000
at the same time. So, it would be
interesting. Maybe it could be

366
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:13,000
collateralized from both the chains. So,
outcomes may happen on both the chains, so

367
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:22,000
some on Ergo side, some on Cardano side.
The other question is for some like

368
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:31,000
real-world use cases, not to have it just
as a quite, I don't know, exciting toy.

369
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:40,000
But yeah, it sounds interesting at least.
Yeah, let's see. Yeah, I think, in regards

370
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:49,000
with such stuff, there are a lot of
technical opportunities between Ergo

371
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Cardano and other UTXO blockchains.

372
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Okay, awesome. Awesome.

373
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:18,000
One last quick question, I guess. When is
the next P2P podcast? Yeah, we need to sit

374
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:22,000
down and record that. Me and Tim have just
been busy kind of working on a few things.

375
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:26,000
So hopefully within this next week, we'll
get something out to you guys.

376
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:31,000
All right. So do you have a guest?

377
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,000
We don't. We'll either just do it with us
or you're welcome to come on and we'd be

378
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,000
happy to chat with you.

379
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Yeah, so we can do one. Let me think. So
yeah, the best time would be around wait

380
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:53,000
or April 19th, Saturday, or Friday before
18th. So something like that, yeah, would

381
00:51:53,000 --> 00:52:01,000
be quite good.

382
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Okay, cool. Yeah. I'll reach out to Tim
and then we'll start a group chat. But

383
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:10,000
what can we talk about? I can maybe
prepare some cool stuff in advance.

384
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:20,000
So I can check the Hydra paper and we can
have a talk about different off-chain

385
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:29,000
systems. So recently I've published that
off-chain design, a new one, it was a

386
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:38,000
forum post on Monday. So the idea is to
have a layer 2 where participants may

387
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:47,000
create IOUs, money off-chain and then have
on-chain redemption for them so it's a

388
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:56,000
kind of reverse of ordinary off-chain cash
schemes such as Fedimint or Cashew for

389
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Bitcoin where you have on-chain reserves
and mint not against them so always

390
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:14,000
redeemable. notes so so so here yeah you
are going opposite so it's not always

391
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:23,000
redeemable maybe but you have more money
off chain which also does make sense i

392
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:32,000
believe in real world applications but
then yeah i'm also interested in those

393
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:41,000
schemes like Cashew Fedimint, Skridcache,
Lightning Network a little bit, but to me

394
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:50,000
it seems limited. Then Hydra and so on, so
like state channel kind of systems. And

395
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:59,000
more so I think there could be maybe
hundreds of different designs. It would be

396
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:08,000
good to think how to make them
interoperable. There are also, for

397
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:17,000
example, there is ARK on Bitcoin. I'm
studying a little bit, but it's hard to

398
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:26,000
say and it looks quite messy. I even asked
in the group recently, do they have any

399
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:35,000
white paper and security analysis and it
seems not really so just massive writings

400
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:44,000
and some codes you need to figure out how
security is by your own and sometimes some

401
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:53,000
issues found there so but still could be
considered as well and as I said there

402
00:54:53,000 --> 00:55:02,000
could be hundreds of different off-chain
designs with properties maybe it's worth

403
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:11,000
to somehow classify them and yeah maybe
for auto generation of chain systems so

404
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:20,000
after okay. Lighting network failure,
which is what we are witnessing. Yeah, I

405
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:29,000
think even Bitcoin Maxis would be quite
open to more off-chain solutions. They're

406
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:38,000
open even now, so it seems ARK, for
example, is getting there from my

407
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:47,000
observations after visiting some there are
two events. I mean so, yeah, we may

408
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:56,000
discuss off-chain schemes, but we may
discuss okay, cool.

409
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Yeah, I mean, I think the ground is super
fertile, and so we'll be excited to

410
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:08,000
explore that here with you. All right,
keep an eye on them. Yeah, absolutely. And

411
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:12,000
let's see. I think one last question. I
know I said the last. time. But someone

412
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:16,000
said, how do you incentivize testnet
mining? I just had this idea. And so we

413
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:20,000
could, if we had a Sigmanauts testnet
mining pool, we could see if your address

414
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:24,000
or you could prove somehow you're mining
to our pool and testnet and mainnet. And

415
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:28,000
then maybe we could give you like bonus
tokens or something like that for mining

416
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:32,000
on both of our pools, testnet and mainnet.
So that's maybe a way to incentivize that.

417
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:36,000
But any case, we can explore that.

418
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:52,000
I actually had an idea to build first
trustless bridge between Ergo mainnet and

419
00:56:52,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Ergo testnet and then we can bring the
testnet ERG to the mainnet and then yeah

420
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:08,000
it's up to people how to incentivize so
maybe some people may put ERG along with

421
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:16,000
testnet ERG into a liquidity pool and so
on interesting to see possible

422
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:24,000
experiments. That would be interesting.

423
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:29,000
Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. It's fun to
experiment.

424
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:38,000
And yeah, by the way, I have some
question, if you mind, the last maybe. So

425
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:47,000
what's Sigmanauts mining pool doing with
the tokens they got from storage rent? Any

426
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:56,000
plans or any actions already aside of that
PHP?

427
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Yeah, for sure. So we launched PHP, let's
see, probably a few months ago, and then

428
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:06,000
CannonQ locked that up into a liquidity
pool with most of it. And then so we're

429
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:11,000
distributing some of it to the miners.
We're distributing, let's see, I think

430
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:16,000
it's on Spectrum DEX. So that's like out
live in the ecosystem repurposed. We have

431
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:21,000
a couple tokens kind of here and there. So
we have like a Carbidge one, an Oracle,

432
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:26,000
test one and two, Felter Snatch. So
nothing really, I guess, of note, but we'd

433
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:31,000
be happy, I suppose, if somebody was
interested. sell them on MewFinance, maybe

434
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:36,000
bundle them all up, get it to the mining
pool. And then we distribute that into the

435
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:41,000
miners. but, the PHP token is the only
token where we've got the totality of all

436
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:46,000
of the supply for a given token. And then
that's where we're like, Hey, let's go

437
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:51,000
ahead and launch something. But, yeah,
it's been actually really great so far. I

438
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:56,000
think, I think the liquidity pool is like
20,000 or something like that for a PHP.

439
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:01,000
So that's, that's kind of neat to see.
Interesting. Nice. and some other random

440
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:06,000
tokens I'm looking at now.

441
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Yeah, but it seems a lot of tokens going
to the pool. So you're collecting all the

442
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:33,000
tokens first. And then decide what to do.
I like to burn.

443
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Yeah, well, I guess token-wise, we
haven't really set any rules or stuff,

444
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:43,000
whether do we want to burn it. Right now,
it's just sitting in our wallet aside from

445
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:48,000
PHP. And then the ERG is distributed based
upon the block and the miner's payout of

446
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:53,000
that, which is equivalent to their
participation. So for example, if you got

447
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:58,000
50% of the reward, we're going to wait
that one for 50% and then the next block

448
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:03,000
is say, you know, 40%. And then we kind of
average that with the rest of everybody

449
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:08,000
else. And then once a week on Tuesdays, we
airdrop that to everybody. And then the

450
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:13,000
pool will start taking 1% of that.

451
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:21,000
All right. Yeah, good. Okay, so we're
rocking and rolling. And so yeah, we got

452
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:26,000
150 last week, we probably have probably
got over maybe like 500 or since we have

453
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:31,000
started, probably more than that.

454
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:37,000
Nice. So it's a nice incentive for our
pool for sure.

455
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:45,000
And yeah, and I guess already maybe
hundreds of kilobytes of garbage cleaned

456
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:53,000
out from the UTXO set.

457
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:59,000
Yeah, definitely. It's pretty neat to
see. It's cool to see. Relative to the

458
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:04,000
Sigmanauts Monocle update, we're debating
right now. Do we open source it? Do we

459
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:09,000
create the steps? I think a lot of the
miners are under the impression, this is

460
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:14,000
what makes us marketable. Most of
everything's on is open source, but we're

461
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:19,000
not going to explicitly give you guys the
steps, I suppose, at least for the time

462
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:24,000
being. So we're going to continue to build
what they call the moat between us and

463
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:29,000
other pools to kind of make us more
marketable and bring more miners in. And

464
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:34,000
then once I think we are sufficient there,
we'll then distribute that or make the

465
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:39,000
steps, I guess, more transparent. But feel
free, if you disagree with us and you're

466
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:44,000
in the mining pool, definitely reach out.
We are going to put it to a vote. And then

467
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:49,000
from there, just reach out if you
disagree, you don't like that. But this

468
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:54,000
isn't necessarily just my opinion, this is
other people's opinions within the pool.

469
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:59,000
It's definitely a collective thought,
although I think qx() is very wanting to

470
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:04,000
release it to the general community. but
again, it's all open source. So if

471
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:09,000
somebody really wanted to try to do it,
they could. So it's not like any of it's

472
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:14,000
closed source.

473
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:40,000
So yeah, let's see. How's it going?

474
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:44,000
All right. So let's wrap up with this.

475
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:48,000
All right. Yeah, that sounds good. Well,
it's a nice chat with you, kushti. Thanks

476
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:52,000
for the questions, everybody.

477
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:57,000
Yeah. Good to see, the format and the
team always changing. And yeah, always

478
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:01,000
building at the same time. So, yeah, have
a good day, Marc, and have a good day,

479
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:05,000
guys. See you, everybody.
