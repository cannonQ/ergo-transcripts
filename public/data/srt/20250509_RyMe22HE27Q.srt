1
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Hello and welcome to the Weekly Ergo
Proof of Work AMA.

2
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
With me today, we have the infamous, the
famous, the desirable, kushti.

3
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
How you doing, kushti?

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I don't know about you.

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Hang in there.

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
We've just been critiqued here at work.

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
So there's like no students around.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Final reviews are pretty much done.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
We had to turn people away yesterday for
a recycling plot and getting bricks

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
because it was too busy.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
We said, come back some other time.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
We don't have time to deal with this
right now.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
So I expect some people coming in around
noon today to swap some plots for bricks.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
But yeah, everything is going pretty
well.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
How was your week?

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Quite busy.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:19,000
There were a couple of releases, 5.0.26
and 5.1.3, so reviewing again 6.0, doing

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:29,000
some cleanup and so on, so hopefully we'll
be done by the end of the week.

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:37,000
And then, yeah, we can propose watching
to the polls, maybe from, I don't know,

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:45,000
like end of May, June 1st, then, yeah,
well, in three months we will. Whether I

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:53,000
have 6.0 activated or not.

22
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
kushti, how does that work?

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
How does that voting work for the miners?

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The miner pools have to change a config
upgrade to that node and then that's it?

25
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Yeah, so they need to specify the words,
yeah, we have a special parameter in

26
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
config.

27
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:23,000
So for some soft fork, well, miners asked
for some simplified versions, so we

28
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:31,000
delivered like two versions during
release, one with the option is set to on

29
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:39,000
and another is set to off.

30
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
But I don't really know.

31
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
So that was around 5.0 voting probably.

32
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
So we had that.

33
00:02:48,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And then, yeah, well, most of miners
indicated the vote for 5.0 soft fork.

34
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
It was made a default option in some
release because, yeah, well, the voting is

35
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
going on for three months.

36
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
But, yeah, well, currently it would be
quite messy, so probably there will be

37
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
just one version.

38
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Well, anyway, there will be two versions,
right, so with the level DB and the

39
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
RocksDB.

40
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
So 6.0, 6.0.

41
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:35,000
one and then yeah well at some point
there will be a version with sub-block

42
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:42,000
support six points I don't know maybe five
but yeah I mean it's a lot of things in

43
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:49,000
the pipeline so about sub-blocks well
working on efficient propagation of a new

44
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:56,000
block

45
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:03,000
because currently peer-to-peer logic is
about using the same mechanism so well

46
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:10,000
input blocks sub-blocks are propagated
when found but when a full block is

47
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:17,000
generated found then yeah it's propagated
fully like it's the case now right with

48
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:24,000
the current client so well

49
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:31,000
There is need to switch to announcing
just transactions not broadcasted before,

50
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:37,000
just few transactions usually.

51
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Two in most cases transactions along with
header and that will be like super

52
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,000
efficient announcement of a new block.

53
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Then we can start testing maybe even in
the public testnet at some point.

54
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
So first probably some devnet, maybe
public devnet.

55
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Are you still looking for people to run
public devnet?

56
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Let's see, so there is need ideally for a
few miners, right, to see competition

57
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
between miners.

58
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
But even in the public test, we have one
miner, right?

59
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Who could be that guy?

60
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Yeah, it would be good to have a few
miners in the public testnet around the

61
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
rollout.

62
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Maybe even trying a mixed option when
some miners are on a sub-block.

63
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Well, also sub-blocks supporting clients
and other miners.

64
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,000
It would be good to test that mixed
option because probably, well, it would be

65
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,000
quite realistic for the mainnet
deployment, quite realistic scenario.

66
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Then, yeah, so for Dexy here, well, I'm
rechecking contracts and deploying one by

67
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:21,000
one in the mainnet.

68
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Then what do we have else?

69
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Also, a lot of talks are continuing,
well, different talks with entities

70
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:41,000
interested in tokenization for real-world
assets, right, and building, then

71
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:49,000
insurance schemes,

72
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
And like one design forum and I'm a
monitor the tools rights.

73
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Well, I'm not even some governance in
Africa with the idea to provide funding

74
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:12,000
for small and medium sized cooperatives
because well in many cases.

75
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:23,000
So the land is owned by some family,
right, or small cooperatives.

76
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Well, they simply don't have funding for
many corporations.

77
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
So, yeah, well, it would be interesting
to apply, well, the tool we have for such

78
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
setting.

79
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Also, well, talking about, well, mesh
networks, right, and well, having digital

80
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:58,000
cash available right even when there is no
internet let's say for some time right so

81
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:08,000
when you may have some local payment group
and then yeah well those settlements if

82
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:18,000
needed using the blockchain

83
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Maybe something like that would be useful
for the brick, right?

84
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
But, I mean, some time is needed for,
well, implementation and even considering

85
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
the proper architecture.

86
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Then, yeah, well, also, so we published a
contract for on-chain reserves supporting

87
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:49,000
a lot of off-chain options.

88
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:56,000
on the forum, and well, one friend of
mine is interested in using that to

89
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:02,000
develop a system rewarding developers,
right?

90
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:13,000
So the developing communities, well, in
open source setting.

91
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:20,000
So you first may contribute, right, to
get maybe some just, I don't know, reward

92
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:27,000
points, right, but then, yeah, this
community may find some sponsor to do

93
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:34,000
settlements to contributors or just
choosing contributors or, well, et cetera,

94
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:41,000
using, well, the blockchain.

95
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
So something like that.

96
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:54,000
So yeah, it's quite interesting to find,
well, the use cases for blockchain.

97
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
So I believe it should be about Web3, but
not that Web3, which is considered now in

98
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,000
the blockchain industry.

99
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:17,000
When some use case and then issue token
and then hype and then run.

100
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Yeah.

101
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:27,000
And yeah, claim that it's web three and
it's revolutionary because, I don't know.

102
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,000
So I spoke to many people asking what
does that mean of Web3.

103
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:38,000
So even the initial article by Gavin Wood
was quite fuzzy, right?

104
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:45,000
And well, what people have in mind now is
totally incomprehensible.

105
00:10:45,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Then, yes, to me, proper web3 is about, I
believe, 99% of use cases.

106
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
There is no need for tokens, right, in
the first place, also well.

107
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Mostly, there is no need for blockchain,
so it should be about mesh networks, Nostr

108
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:27,000
services, IPFS services, distributed
decentralized peer-to-peer systems.

109
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Well, mostly off-chain payment systems.

110
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Well, using blockchain is just a global
settlement layer, which is quite close to

111
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:52,000
the original ideas, I believe, of Hal
Finny, for example, from 2010.

112
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:59,000
But yeah, I mean, these days, it's mostly
something different and it's hard to

113
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:06,000
understand what the people are doing most
of the time.

114
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
All right.

115
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:16,000
So, but yeah, so I think, well, where
tokens are needed is, well, real-world

116
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:23,000
assets tokenization, right?

117
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,000
And, well, algorithmic stable coins, for
example, for insurance schemes and so on,

118
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,000
right?

119
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
And so on.

120
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:48,000
So, yeah, well, busy, as you know, and
yeah, so.

121
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Hal Finny's birthday was on the fourth, I
think, kushti?

122
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
We just had Hal Finny's birthday on the
fourth, it would have turned. How old

123
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
would he have been? 60 something.

124
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Let's see.

125
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
He's 59.

126
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Hal Finny's birthday was on May 4th.

127
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
60.

128
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
You mentioned health, and I just
remembered that it's his birthday.

129
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
We just passed his birthday.

130
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Oh, really?

131
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Yeah.

132
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I didn't know even, to be honest.

133
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Yeah, then some talks are going on in
regards with blockchain development after

134
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:34,000
6.0, right?

135
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,000
One week ago, we started discussions
about Sigma chains and so on.

136
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,000
So yeah, we'll discuss these things.

137
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
kushti, I'm wondering about the nodes,
right?

138
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Should we start, at least on GitHub,
should we start referencing the rock

139
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:01,000
database and what's the other database
that the original node used?

140
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Level, levelDB.

141
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,000
So should we start at least naming the
files for the node so that people know

142
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,000
that the level DB is more compatible with
like maybe older devices or Raspberry Pis

143
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,000
and the rock database should be the node
of choice considering it's love of SSDs

144
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,000
and it's a bit snappier kind of thing?

145
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Is that a possible thing we can do?

146
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
It would be good to compile a table.

147
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Maybe we did that even at some point,
like which platform supported.

148
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:48,000
So for RocksDB, the issue is that less
platforms supported.

149
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:55,000
But yeah, the overall stability is
better, it seems right.

150
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Yeah, I was running RocksDB on a side
project that I'm doing.

151
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
And it's crashed.

152
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
The computer has crashed on me many, many
times over the past couple of weeks as I

153
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
increased the RAM load on it.

154
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
And zero issues with RocksDB.

155
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
The database comes right back up,
continues finding blocks and good.

156
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
If this were LevelDB, it probably would
have required a resync of the node

157
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
already.

158
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:28,000
but it's been fantastic with RocksDB and
getting this machine stable.

159
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Yeah so it's more stable and yeah I think
it's also generally much better probably

160
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:46,000
for SSD.

161
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:56,000
storage and so if you're using HDD maybe
level DB is more efficient even right so

162
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:06,000
well level DB is quite popular database
and yeah it's used in Bitcoin core right

163
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:16,000
and well the funny story is that we even
tried to do our own database

164
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:25,000
We did one back in IOG, so it was called
IODB.

165
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:33,000
So it was a quite specialized database
for blockchains.

166
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,000
So after that, there were several other
efforts, but that was the first one.

167
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Why build from scratch, kushti?

168
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Why not just optimize and fork something
already out there that's open source?

169
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Yeah, but the guy who worked on that, he
built some quite well-known databases in

170
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:05,000
the Java world, right, so first he worked
for H2 and yeah, they also have some key

171
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:15,000
value database and then yeah, he worked on
some kind of low-level database, MapDB.

172
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Jan Kotik was the guy and so yeah, well,
it was his own choice, right?

173
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Because he is very proficient in that
database engines and so on.

174
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:43,000
But yeah, it wasn't quite finished,
right?

175
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:49,000
And yeah, unfortunately, the guy wasn't
stable also.

176
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:57,000
He didn't deliver major MapDB releases.

177
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
He didn't finish IODB as well.

178
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
So at some point we switched to... Did he
go on to work at Ethereum or Solana,

179
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
kushti?

180
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I don't know what he's doing.

181
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:16,000
But yeah, so he's a highly professional
guy.

182
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:23,000
working on database engines, so I'm not
sure about Solana or whatever.

183
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
That was a joke, kushti.

184
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
All right.

185
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Then we switched to LevelDB, which is
used in Bitcoin Core.

186
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,000
And RocksDB is basically some fork of
LevelDB, which was quite abandoned at some

187
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:46,000
point.

188
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
It'd be nice if there was some sort of
conversion tool, kushti, that somebody

189
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,000
wanting to switch over to RocksDB wouldn't
have to resync an entire node.

190
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Granted, it doesn't take too long, a day
or so, depending on your connection, I

191
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
guess.

192
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
But still, it'd be nice to push a button,
do a conversion, and be up and running on

193
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
rocks from level database.

194
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:16,000
But I understand it's probably not a
high-trafficked request.

195
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Yeah, I mean, would be good, but yeah,
well, there is no bandwidth for that for

196
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:26,000
developers.

197
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:34,000
And yeah, well, we need, for all more
developers, well, in regards with sigma

198
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:42,000
chains and so on right well even for
sub-blocks related development and well

199
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:50,000
other things so after 6.0 I think well
there is value in extending

200
00:19:51,000 --> 00:20:02,000
capabilities of contractual layer to
support different execution environments.

201
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Currently the Ergo chain is supported so
that would be good to make possibility to

202
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:18,000
extend easily to other blockchains as well
as off-chain execution environments.

203
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:28,000
So that was an idea which we discussed a
lot back in smartcontract.com days along

204
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:38,000
with Sergey Nazarov and Steve Ellis right
so to do some well tooling to execute

205
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:48,000
off-chain contracts right well

206
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
maybe in some case it makes sense.

207
00:20:53,000 --> 00:21:00,000
And well, with the ErgoTree, it's even
possible to do contracts which can be

208
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:07,000
executed off-chain only at a certain point
and then, yeah, they can be submitted to

209
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:14,000
blockchain as well.

210
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Probably, well, it would be quite
interesting, right?

211
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,000
It's not possible with EVM and other...

212
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:30,000
So in the UTXO set, kushti, those kind of
things would work where the collateral

213
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,000
would be essentially, or the value would
be locked into a contract that could not

214
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:40,000
be removed until you brought forward
whatever happened off-chain essentially so

215
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,000
right before or year participants satisfy
some condition in off-chain environments

216
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:50,000
right so the collateral can't go anywhere
until the off-chain code is brought back

217
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,000
on and checked and signed online
essentially to show proof that either it

218
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:00,000
transferred or some was taken from it or
that kind of thing so that's pretty damn

219
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,000
cool but then so then the question kushti
is how do

220
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
So you need some sort of trusted
application, right?

221
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Offline.

222
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,000
So that if you and I are exchanging some
sort of offline contract, how do I know?

223
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:26,000
How do I verify that it's happening and
I'm really getting what I'm getting.

224
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Yeah.

225
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,000
So, but what do you need to... In a
minimal case, it's a trusted context to do

226
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:37,000
execution again.

227
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:44,000
So you can do execution in peer-to-peer
setting even, but you need for some

228
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:50,000
trusted context, which is actually not
different from using oracles on chain.

229
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Just more efficient and private probably.

230
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,000
more efficient private so on on
blockchain you are just finalizing right

231
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:08,000
financial agreements for financial
outcomes right you fix them and yeah

232
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,000
off-chain you need for some trusted
context provider basically right but

233
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:18,000
that's not different from oracle

234
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,000
So something like that, but yeah, well,
there is need to find time and finalize

235
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,000
all those thoughts.

236
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:37,000
And yeah, well, currently quite busy with
other things.

237
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:42,000
But yeah, well, I think it would be quite
interesting.

238
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:49,000
And by the way, well, chain link 2.0
papers.

239
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Quite about that, right.

240
00:23:52,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Actually, it's mostly about, well, ideas
we discussed back in smartcontract.com

241
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:08,000
days back in 2014, 2015.

242
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:13,000
So, yeah, because there was no factors,
right, unfortunate factors like Ethereum

243
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:18,000
network.

244
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:30,000
So, well, there was possibility to be
concentrated on some real things.

245
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,000
and demands, but yeah, well, it's
probably oriented towards the needs of big

246
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
corporations and so on.

247
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:46,000
And well, I think, well, you can find
well source of trusted context in much

248
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:53,000
smaller environments, right?

249
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Right, so you could see community
organizations offering a bank of trusted

250
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:04,000
authorizations of these contracts or
holders of this, correct?

251
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Right, yeah, so it could be a small-scale
environment.

252
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Well, trust maybe is not so big question,
right?

253
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Because, well, in small community, well,
big trust is usually not an issue, right?

254
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:35,000
And in opposite, so when it's some big
system, well, it's hard to get trust,

255
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:42,000
right, to anybody.

256
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
All right.

257
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Speaking of devs, kushti, are you going
to join on the AI, ErgoHack 10?

258
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
I need to check, actually.

259
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:04,000
It depends on, yeah, sub-blocks,
developments, and 6.0.

260
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:14,000
So, well, if certain milestones will be
met, then probably, yeah.

261
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Let's see.

262
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,000
So it's starting on the May 20th, right?

263
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,000
I believe so. Yep. You got it.

264
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Yep, they've got the Ergo, just go to
ErgoHack.io for people watching and

265
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,000
interested and they've got the apply here
button as well as an explanation of AI on

266
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,000
the Ergo blockchain.

267
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:46,000
So yeah, I don't know, I don't know if I
have time to join, but it's definitely

268
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:52,000
ways that I've seen, what's it called?

269
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
There's some stuff in the background
happening that one of the developers is

270
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
working on that you guys haven't seen in a
while that uses AI, and I think they're

271
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
going to join.

272
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:06,000
But there's so much opportunity even for
simple stuff, like using AI for

273
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,000
auto-generation of artwork.

274
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,000
and things like that as simple as that,
baking that into some sort of front-end

275
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,000
NFT development that I've seen being
worked on.

276
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
That's pretty cool.

277
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
So I'm looking forward to what's coming
up with here.

278
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,000
I know Mark the Shark does a lot with
MCPs and AI to help you do coding as well

279
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,000
as ping things on the blockchain.

280
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,000
So hopefully we'll see some of that stuff
show up in ErgoHack.

281
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Because I mean, one of the big pain
points that I run into here for casual

282
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,000
developers, or not even developers,
project leaders, right?

283
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,000
People running things like Bulvar,
GreasyCex, they need ways of airdropping

284
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,000
and pulling the chain that, sure, airdrop
tools are helpful, but what if they want

285
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,000
to know exactly who's holding what and how
long they've been holding it for and those

286
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,000
kind of things.

287
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:11,000
So there's a lot of opportunity for those
kind of AI toolings that can query the

288
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:16,000
blockchain with zero dev knowledge and
really give you back what you want.

289
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,000
So yeah, looking forward to that.

290
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:26,000
But kushti, I wanted to talk about
Rosen's treasury proposals.

291
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Have you seen those come across the line?

292
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Yeah, but yeah, so what's...

293
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:39,000
So Joe snuck out four treasury proposals.

294
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Yeah, so what are you finding interesting
here?

295
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Yeah, so I was looking at treasury
proposal three.

296
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:49,000
So one of the things I talked about a
couple of weeks ago was, what's it called?

297
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:54,000
getting listed on Kraken right we were
dealing with talking directly to Dave then

298
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:59,000
there was an opportunity I spoke about of
a kind of a back door entrance I'll let

299
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Mark I'll let Glasgow talk more on the
back door entrance as he's gotten some

300
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:09,000
more info on that I'm not very

301
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:20,000
I don't think it's a great option, but
we'll see what he says on that.

302
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:28,000
But anyway, Rosen Proposal 3 deals with
this kind of thing by supporting SPOs.

303
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:34,000
A lot of funds came from, what's it
called, catalysts on Cardano.

304
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:39,000
And the idea is that let's, Rosen can
kind of give it back, but at the same

305
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:44,000
time, and more importantly, really bolster
ERG, Rosen ERG adoption on Cardano.

306
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
So what that does is twofold, right?

307
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:51,000
If Rosen is allowing some sort of HODL
game or SPO rewards in Rosen ERG based on

308
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:56,000
transactions in Rosen,

309
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,000
as well as Rosen proposal one which
bolsters liquidity quite a bit in all the

310
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,000
pools to encourage what's it called
arbitrage across and moving across a

311
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,000
bridge.

312
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:16,000
So think of proposal one, we're going to
bolster liquidity so that we encourage

313
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,000
swapping and nobody experiences losses or
very much when they do that.

314
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Proposal number three, we skip to where
that actually rewards people for holding

315
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
that Rosen ERG.

316
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:31,000
And what that does is if you remember
from a couple of weeks ago, one of the

317
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:36,000
requirements, soft requirements that
Kraken was giving us was thousands of

318
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:41,000
holders, 10,000 holders to be exact around
that target, as well as a decent amount of

319
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:46,000
volume on the chain, which I think we
already have on Cardano.

320
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,000
So what Rosen Treasury Proposal 3 does
essentially is gets Rosen ERG into a lot

321
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,000
of people's wallets, so that'll take care
of the first issue there, as well as

322
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,000
encourages swapping across the bridge.

323
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
So I think they're really cool proposals.

324
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,000
They're out on, again, they're the GARD
proposals.

325
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
But I know a lot of you are Sigmanauts.

326
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:14,000
And since Sigmanauts own one of the
guards, it'll be a Sigmanaut votes first

327
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:19,000
to see what the Sigmanaut guard will
actually vote for.

328
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,000
So a lot of you are involved in
Sigmanauts and have that power to make

329
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,000
that decision on what the Sigmanaut guard
does.

330
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
I encourage you to read proposals one
through four.

331
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:34,000
I think they're all pretty good proposals
brought forth by Armeanio.

332
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
And think of it, don't think of it as in
a way as, oh, you know, we're giving away,

333
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
you know, treasury money that the
Sigmanauts earned essentially, or any of

334
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
the guards earned.

335
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Think of it as we're utilizing funds we
didn't have before.

336
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:54,000
essentially given to us by running a
guard service which which i've been

337
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:00,000
running so no skin off your backs guys and
then we can take these funds and actually

338
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:06,000
do something good to either give us help
us get us listed on kraken

339
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:11,000
get adoption of Rosen ERG, bolster the
liquidity pool so we can see more larger

340
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:16,000
$50,000, $60,000 transfers between pools
without the worry of slippage.

341
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:22,000
And that, in fact, will eventually
bolster the watcher.

342
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
payouts.

343
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
So then we'll get more watchers and we'll
get more interest.

344
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
We'll get more people holding Rosen.

345
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,000
We'll get more people locking up ERGs,
locking up Rosen.

346
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,000
It all is a well-thought-out strategic
cascading effect to get funds locked, to

347
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:40,000
get funds to create more wallets for
people in other ecosystems.

348
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:46,000
So read them carefully with that lens on
and I think you might be swayed by Joe's

349
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:51,000
writings and musings and proposals.

350
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
That's the short of that, kushti.

351
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:01,000
All right, yeah, so I've checked the
proposals for all of them.

352
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
You read them right now in three minutes.

353
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Perfect, kushti.

354
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
No, no, no.

355
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,000
So yeah, read the first three on the
second day probably, and yeah, the fourth

356
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,000
one just immediately.

357
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
So yeah, I think it's much needed.

358
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Right, right.

359
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Develop liquidity around rights.

360
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Not only, but the fourth one, kushti, is
specifically injecting funds for

361
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
development, right?

362
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Sigma Chains, Rosen Bridge, and contract
enhancements for Ergo Dex.

363
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
So, I mean, they're literally diverting
right back into the development of Ergo

364
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
for that.

365
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:41,000
So, it's like a win-win across the entire
ecosystem, I feel.

366
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Yeah, yeah.

367
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Well, it's, it's needed to increase
liquidity rights.

368
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Yeah.

369
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Yeah.

370
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Yep.

371
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
A hundred percent.

372
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
The question is how to do that.

373
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Right.

374
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:01,000
And in the environments where, well, no
one is controlling, the, the ecosystem,

375
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:06,000
right.

376
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:11,000
It's.

377
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:22,000
But then, yeah, well, it's, I think,
quite reasonable step forward.

378
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
All right.

379
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Let's do some questions, kushti.

380
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Sound all right.

381
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Yeah.

382
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
All right.

383
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Let's see.

384
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
All right, we've got a question from Ursa
Minor, kushti.

385
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Is BASIS an extension of ChainCash to
encourage centralized systems to provide

386
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,000
standard notes, blockchain banking?

387
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Is this the beginning of double entry
accounting methods using blockchain?

388
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Yeah, so it's similar to ChainCash.

389
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:55,000
And basically, the contract is a
modification of ChainCash reserve

390
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,000
contracts.

391
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Maybe, yeah, that could be done more in
future, right?

392
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:19,000
So, for example, to have on-chain cash
node, which is backed by a few parties and

393
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:29,000
then, well, also used as a reserve even
for off-chain payments, right?

394
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:35,000
But yeah, currently, well, the approach
is to use modified reserve contract

395
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:41,000
support of chain notes with no any
requirements basically to the notes aside

396
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:47,000
of being assigned.

397
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:54,000
by a reserve provider as well as some
entity also, which is tracking of chain

398
00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:01,000
payments, to simplify the issues of
tracking.

399
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Even that part could be missed, so maybe
in some environments there is no need for

400
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:11,000
this tracker.

401
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Signature, but yeah, I think in most
cases it would be needed, right?

402
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Yeah, well, it's true, it's a similar
approach to ChainCash, but yeah, well, now

403
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:40,000
just one reserve provider, but then yeah,
well, off-chain, you can build maybe a

404
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:48,000
system with, well, backing from multiple
reserves, right?

405
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:53,000
For example, having some trusted tracker.

406
00:36:53,000 --> 00:37:00,000
which is collecting signatures from
multiple reserves, but provides only a

407
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:07,000
single signature during redemption, then
discarding other requests.

408
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
And so on.

409
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:18,000
So, yeah, well, the main idea is to use
it in environments where there are some

410
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:27,000
trust rights off-chain, like community
currencies.

411
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Yeah, maybe these developer communities,
right, and so on.

412
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:41,000
So, well, it's still to be analyzed,
right, for different security threats,

413
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:48,000
attacks, and so on.

414
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:57,000
But, well, with some trust in off-chain,
I think it could be used right now.

415
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
What happens if I guess with a ChainCash,
let's say, you know, cause you can stack

416
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
collateral into ChainCash, right?

417
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
As it moves along, you can add and
subtract different collaterals into

418
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
ChainCash.

419
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:15,000
So what happens if, you know, there's...
What happens in the market if you find out

420
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:20,000
that one of these trusted entities is not
trusted anymore?

421
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
These ChainCash notes all of a sudden
lose quite a bit of value in collateral,

422
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
no?

423
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Almost like a subprime mortgage backing
crash?

424
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,000
where all of a sudden all these ChainCash
notes that have been at least touched or

425
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,000
tainted or included with perhaps a bad, a
malicious actor, a backer, would lose

426
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,000
value pretty quickly, right?

427
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Yes.

428
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:48,000
So, you know, in ChainCash, you can issue
notes without any backing, right?

429
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
So then it's...

430
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Right, right.

431
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
purely trust-based.

432
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:57,000
And then, yeah, well, it's up to you
whether to accept such notes or not.

433
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
But yeah, if you accept them, then yeah,
well, you are getting all the trust

434
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
issues.

435
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Right, right, right.

436
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Well, it's just your responsibility.

437
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:13,000
But what's good here, I think, is that no
one is enforced to trust.

438
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:19,000
So there are very simple protocol rules
and that's the only thing you have to

439
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:25,000
trust.

440
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Well, unlike, for example, complex stable
coins, algorithmic stable coins protocols,

441
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:41,000
to the best of my observations, people
just trust, right?

442
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:45,000
That's, I mean, they are safe, but they
have no idea how it works either.

443
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
So yeah, no, I, no idea.

444
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,000
How does it work actually?

445
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,000
So, here, rules are simple and, then,
yeah, it's up to you, but you are not

446
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,000
enforced, right?

447
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Unlike, the stable coin protocols.

448
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Yeah, well, every participant has freedom
to accept or not.

449
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:17,000
And then, yeah, well, certain... issues
are possible and maybe even collapse of

450
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:25,000
certain contours rights and ChainCash
powered economies.

451
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:34,000
But the whole economy I believe still
would be okay, right?

452
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:39,000
So in some sense, it's fragile.

453
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Designs, well, unlike, you know, well,
economies where it isn't forced to accept,

454
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:51,000
well, instruments.

455
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:57,000
You may not like, well, for example,
government issued debt instruments such as

456
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:02,000
fiat currency rights.

457
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:12,000
So for conservative players it's always
possible to stay on the ground to avoid

458
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:21,000
failures.

459
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:28,000
kushti, I wonder if there's a subversion
of collateral you could enter into the

460
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:34,000
ChainCash contract that would act as an
insurance, essentially.

461
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,000
So I know all collateral is an insurance,
right, in this instance.

462
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,000
But specifically, an entity that could be
tracked as a single entity that would be

463
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,000
providing insurance to ChainCash notes
that would also include liquidity or,

464
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,000
sorry, collateral.

465
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:57,000
And then you essentially could track
defaults on chain.

466
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:03,000
So you could track every time that this
insurance policy was actually spent.

467
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:07,000
And then you could track and judge and
have a metric for trust of collateralizing

468
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:11,000
institutions that were defaulting or
failing to provide the trusted

469
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:15,000
collateralization.

470
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,000
So let's say you and I enter a contract
and there's no collateral, right?

471
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,000
So I trust that you're giving me a note
and I trust the value that you've verbally

472
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,000
or contractually attached to it, but
there's no collateral.

473
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:32,000
We could insert some collateral from an
insurance company, per se, and then If you

474
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,000
failed to deliver, if I wanted to cash
out, you failed to deliver, that insurance

475
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,000
company would pay that.

476
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,000
And then on Shane, it would be shown that
you were in default, essentially.

477
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:47,000
So now we know that the trusted bank of
kushti has defaulted X amount of times and

478
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:51,000
insurance collateral has been redeemed
this many of times.

479
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:56,000
So there would be a metric online to be
able to measure that kind of thing.

480
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,000
I think that's possible.

481
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:04,000
The issue is that, you know, what
constitutes default, right?

482
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:10,000
So, well, the default is when, so your
default, for example, right, is when all

483
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:16,000
the notes issued by you are not accepted
by all the, well, agents, right, in the

484
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:22,000
economy.

485
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:30,000
But you cannot probably say with
confidence that notes are not acceptable

486
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:38,000
because, well, historically, there were
examples when currencies of failed central

487
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:46,000
banks continued to be used.

488
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:57,000
For example, even 30 years after failure
of central bank of Somali.

489
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:10,000
So the notes of non-existing central bank
still being used, right?

490
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Because, well, it's still the best
option, right?

491
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,000
So yeah, I mean, it's hard to say what
does default mean.

492
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
I gotcha.

493
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Especially if there are no reserves,
right?

494
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
So if it's truly...

495
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Right, right.

496
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:39,000
So, and, well, even in the world of DeFi
and so on, so, some people are still

497
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:45,000
trading, these, classic, Terra Luna,
right?

498
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:51,000
So they rename the original coins to
classic.

499
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
You know, I love that.

500
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
I love that mentality.

501
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
They're like, they're like, it's only a
hundred bucks.

502
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,000
I'll just throw a hundred bucks in and it
might make me a millionaire.

503
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,000
It's like,

504
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Right.

505
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:07,000
So do we have defaults there or not?

506
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Really?

507
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
So it's hard to say, right?

508
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Yeah, that's a good point.

509
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:15,000
People are still trading failed stable
coins, right?

510
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Buying and selling them like one dollar
for two cents.

511
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Oh, boy.

512
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,000
All right.

513
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
We got another question.

514
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,000
It looks like the big 3D is in a good
mood today because the markets are green,

515
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,000
I guess.

516
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,000
So he's got a question, kushti.

517
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:41,000
It says, can you please provide a
breakdown of next steps for sub-blocks?

518
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,000
I guess you already kind of answered
that.

519
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Is there an ETA when they can expect
two-second transactions to go live?

520
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Maybe on testnet.

521
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:55,000
When on testnet, you think we can start
seeing two-second transactions?

522
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:08,000
oh so i don't know maybe next week even
so it's just like some some changes right

523
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:21,000
which are not quite predictable i mean
what's ETA there but yeah they're not

524
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,000
They should be so big, right?

525
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:32,000
So, well, let's try to roll out something
maybe next week.

526
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:40,000
So, yeah, it was possible to roll out
things even a few days before, but, you

527
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:48,000
know, the point is when you're deploying
peer to peer protocol, which is a subject

528
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:56,000
to change.

529
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,000
So those changes would be painful, right?

530
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:04,000
So it's, it's better to deliver some
finalized more or less version.

531
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
But, yeah, I don't know.

532
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,000
So if, that's not a big issue.

533
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:15,000
So for example, if we are going to launch
some public devnet with an agreement that

534
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:20,000
it could be shut down, like in two, three
weeks, then yeah, I mean, we can do that

535
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:25,000
today even.

536
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Why not?

537
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:33,000
So that depends on deployment scenario.

538
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
All right.

539
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,000
So yes, still a lot of changes are
possible.

540
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:45,000
And well, those which are planned for
peer-to-peer layer, so it's better to

541
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:52,000
finalize things before deployment.

542
00:47:52,000 --> 00:48:00,000
If we are talking about backwards
compatibility, So some need for it, but if

543
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:08,000
there is no any need for backwards
compatibility, we can do deployments.

544
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Well, it's a little bit about the fast
and loose or, or slower and correct

545
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:14,000
essentially method.

546
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
So that's understood.

547
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Yeah.

548
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:23,000
But, so usually, it's, somewhere in
between, right?

549
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
So it's about testnet.

550
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:33,000
So yeah, we, we, had 6.0 deployments when
it was more or less finalized, but well,

551
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Even after the initial deployment, there
were some breaking changes, actually.

552
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:47,000
And, well, it was okay for the network
just because, well, it's not trivial to

553
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:53,000
break the network, right, but still
possible with the changes done.

554
00:48:54,000 --> 00:49:02,000
And yeah, so in regards with peer-to-peer
layer, it's quite complicated, but yeah,

555
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:10,000
well, if it's about some public devnet to
be alive for two or three weeks,

556
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:17,000
Then, yeah, we can do deployment just
today.

557
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
So let's see.

558
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:32,000
We can set some day, right, and deploy
whatever possible by the day.

559
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:38,000
So it would be whether devnet for two
weeks or maybe something more stable.

560
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:45,000
That also could be an option if people
are willing to test something.

561
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:49,000
We can just CPU mine this public devnet
anyway, right?

562
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,000
No need to point GPUs to it.

563
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Keep the difficulty low.

564
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Yeah.

565
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Anyone can do that actually right now,
probably using the branch.

566
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:03,000
So I didn't test the latest commits, but
should be okay.

567
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:08,000
So can test today.

568
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:21,000
I can roll out maybe, so I can use some
server of mine to deploy.

569
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,000
That's OK.

570
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
I've got plenty, kushti.

571
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Don't waste any of your machines.

572
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,000
OK, we've got another.

573
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Let's keep going, kushti.

574
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Let's see, where is it?

575
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Here we go.

576
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Another one for the big 3D.

577
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:40,000
qx(), when can we expect push for more
holders of Rosen ERG on Cardano?

578
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
We need that Kraken listing.

579
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,000
So, big 3D, if you rewind a little bit, I
talked about proposal number three from

580
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Rosen Bridge.

581
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,000
That's exactly what this is.

582
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
So, right.

583
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:55,000
If I told you guys a couple weeks ago, I
can't remember, the little secret was we

584
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:59,000
were going to develop a bot that does
airdrops to Cardano to get the token

585
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:03,000
holders up because it's crypto baby it's
just a bunch of bullshit you know Kraken's

586
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:07,000
looking to push a box on his little sheet
that says yeah they have 10,000 holders

587
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:11,000
it's just a line of bullshit but anyway so

588
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Armeanio has proposed a really nice legit
version of that with SPO and HODL-Rosen

589
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:24,000
techniques across chains.

590
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:29,000
So please read those proposals, big 3D,
and hound the Sigmanauts.

591
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,000
Look up the Sigmanauts member and say,
hey, I like this proposal.

592
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,000
You guys should vote for this.

593
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Or become a Sigmanaut and push it.

594
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,000
That's how it works.

595
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Let's see.

596
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,000
This is always a tough one.

597
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
This is from a buddy, Aco.

598
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:52,000
By the way, Aco has a direct access to
Postgres database now.

599
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:57,000
So let's get on Aco for doing some cool
stuff with ErgoExplorer so that we can see

600
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:02,000
a lot of different things, kind of like
Cardano scan, where you can see the amount

601
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:07,000
of transactions, the amount of not
holders, but the amount of lots.

602
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Direct access gives you much more
flexibility when looking up things.

603
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
We expect to see great things from Aco.

604
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Anyway, it says, continue on kushti's
call for action regarding marketing.

605
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Can you talk about any plans for
marketing from the EF or anyone?

606
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Sub-blocks should have a big spotlight.

607
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,000
Unfortunately, neither kushti nor I are
members of the EF.

608
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:33,000
So we can't really comment on what the EF
is planning to do from there.

609
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,000
I know that I am always looking for help
on Ergo Twitter, the main Ergo Twitter

610
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,000
account.

611
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:44,000
So Rustin helps out a lot, but Rustin has
real life things to get in the way

612
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:48,000
sometimes, so he'll be gone for a few
weeks at a time.

613
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
So we definitely need coverage.

614
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:55,000
So any of you who are in love with Ergo
and know enough about Ergo to put some

615
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:59,000
posts out, I will make you a delegate on
the main Ergo Twitter account and you can

616
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:03,000
help out, right?

617
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,000
So please help out with that effort, at
least on Twitter.

618
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Advertise things like Mark and Tim, Tim
Erg's broadcast for the peer-to-peer

619
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:17,000
podcast, those kind of things.

620
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Create your own podcast about that kind
of stuff.

621
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Put them out there.

622
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
All those things that you see that
community members make, it makes a huge

623
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
difference when you guys rebroadcast, when
you watch them, when you talk about them,

624
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
and put them out there.

625
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:33,000
That's the kind of marketing we can do as
community members.

626
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:38,000
But yeah, and don't be shy to talk to
Mark and ask him, sorry, Glasgow.

627
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,000
or AMG or anybody else on the EF.

628
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,000
mgPai, right?

629
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:46,000
He's probably done with finals this
Friday.

630
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:50,000
So feel free to hound mgPai about what
the EF is looking for for marketing.

631
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:53,000
So I encourage you guys to talk about
that.

632
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Yeah.

633
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Right.

634
00:53:55,000 --> 00:54:02,000
So, yeah, well, I have some ideas about
marketing of sub-blocks, right, in regards

635
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:09,000
with high performance proof of work.

636
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:14,000
And, yeah, even, getting, some funding
for that, but, it's, quite early, turn

637
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:19,000
ons.

638
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Let's see.

639
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:27,000
So we will have, Twitter spaces with, the
coin Republic and, crypto reach on

640
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Saturday now.

641
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Right.

642
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,000
What happened that, that just had to be
postponed for a little bit.

643
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Yeah, so yesterday there were some issues
on the coin republic sites.

644
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:49,000
All right, so well, crypto reach had to
cancel.

645
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:54,000
So we considered different options like
moving to his channel.

646
00:54:54,000 --> 00:55:04,000
or well, just postponing kids while
recording zoom.

647
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:09,000
like we did a couple of times back in
2020.

648
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:17,000
So yeah, yeah, finally, we've decided to
move it to Saturday and well, but maybe

649
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:25,000
it's still quite an announcement, I think.

650
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:28,000
So yeah, let's see.

651
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:35,000
But, well, anyway, I think, well, it will
be quite modern and still quite unique

652
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:42,000
results, right?

653
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:48,000
And, well, high performance network
networks.

654
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:57,000
And, well, there is needs definitely to
promote it and get attention from, yeah.

655
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:04,000
people interested in consensus and well,
proof of work rights along with sigma

656
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:11,000
chains and so on and so on, a lot of
things.

657
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:23,000
We are discussing how to organize wealth
efforts within that space.

658
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,000
All right, we've got one.

659
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,000
Actually, I've got a question onto this,
too.

660
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
We've got Bobcat here.

661
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
What are your thoughts on Rosen using
Snarks to strengthen the watcher guard

662
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
model?

663
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:37,000
So that also brings me to the question of
we see the recent release of Bitcoin OS

664
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:41,000
for Cardano, right?

665
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
And they're using fully non-custodial.

666
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:51,000
They're using contracts to lock up stuff
as opposed to kind of a watcher guard set.

667
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:55,000
What's the advantage of that, kushti?

668
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:59,000
You see something like Bitcoin OS using
Snarks fully without a watcher guard set

669
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:03,000
compared to something like Rosen Bridge.

670
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,000
And is it fair to not call Bitcoin OS a
bridge?

671
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:10,000
I mean, they're technically bridging.

672
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
They're just doing it differently.

673
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,000
Plus, I hate the burn and mint method.

674
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
I think that's the dumbest thing ever.

675
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Maybe that's just me.

676
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,000
I think it's much more realistic that
Rosen is creating and locking all tokens

677
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:24,000
all at once.

678
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,000
And there's no burn.

679
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
There's no mint.

680
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
It's all done right off the bat.

681
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:32,000
But anyway, what are your thoughts,
kushti?

682
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:37,000
Oh, you know, so there are many
dimensions here, right?

683
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:43,000
So well, Rosen approach also probably
simpler, right?

684
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:52,000
hard to say in in regards with all all
those recent things like bit vm bitcoin os

685
00:57:52,000 --> 00:58:01,000
and so on so there are certain scenarios
which are not considered like mass exit

686
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:10,000
right and in all those protocols so the
same is true for ark

687
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:21,000
And then BitVM, I believe all those BitVM
protocols.

688
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:26,000
So what happens in a mass exit on
something like Bitcoin OS with Snarks?

689
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:33,000
So just the main network would be
congested because exit transactions.

690
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:38,000
So mints and burns can happen kind of
thing and it just pile up?

691
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:41,000
Yeah.

692
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:44,000
So in case of multiple fraud proofs
posted on the blockchain, it would be

693
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:50,000
quite congested.

694
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,000
Right.

695
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
And with the, with the Rosen Bridge, at
least the watchers would probably pick up

696
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
the fraud before.

697
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
And if they didn't pick it up, then the
guard would pick it up.

698
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:00,000
So they wouldn't even get past that
point.

699
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Right.

700
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
And, yeah.

701
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:06,000
So.

702
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:13,000
hard to say I mean so technically you
know well yeah it's it's trustless but

703
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:20,000
yeah well there are some new vectors which
are not even considered so I have attended

704
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:27,000
some Bitcoin lightning events back in
February

705
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:37,000
around Hong Kong and it was some panel
with Blockstream CEO and other folks, some

706
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:46,000
developers of Lightning Network.

707
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:52,000
So some BitVM solutions were discussed as
well.

708
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:56,000
And so, and so, and yeah, you even asked
directly questions about mass exit

709
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:00,000
scenarios, right?

710
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:05,000
In some Bitcoin power protocols, I even
forgotten which ones actually.

711
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:10,000
And yeah, well, it seems that there is no
clear answer.

712
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:15,000
I mean, it's just not considered.

713
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:21,000
But then, yeah, well, there are also more
trivial issues, well, tied with

714
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:27,000
complexity, right?

715
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:31,000
So if it's complex, then it's better to
wait for some time before using it, right,

716
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:35,000
usually?

717
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Because, well, usually the problems are
in implementations, like Zcash, for

718
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:41,000
example.

719
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:54,000
had some issue in its circuits, right?

720
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:57,000
Unnoticed.

721
01:00:54,000 --> 01:01:01,000
So it was a typo even in the paper.

722
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:05,000
So developers just implemented paper as
is.

723
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
Oh, with the typo?

724
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:10,000
Oh, shit.

725
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
That's rough.

726
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:17,000
Yeah, and because of that, even a hidden
emission of Zcash was possible if my

727
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:22,000
memory serves me well.

728
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:27,000
It was possible to mint Zcash.

729
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:32,000
It was a second problem.

730
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:43,000
So, yeah, I mean, it's often, you know, I
mean, quite good, but you have details.

731
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:46,000
So, yeah, well, let's see.

732
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:53,000
So I'm watching a little bit all those
things in the Bitcoin space, like Bitcoin,

733
01:01:53,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Bitcoin OS, ARK, Cashew, Fedemint, and so
on.

734
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:07,000
And yeah, I mean, it's quite exciting,
especially considering that you can

735
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:13,000
replicate it in simpler ways on Ergo
right.

736
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:22,000
because ergo is kind of hyper bitcoin but
yeah well also new trade-offs and issues

737
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:31,000
so yeah it's not quite clear what's worth
to replicate right as soon as possible

738
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:40,000
probably maybe not

739
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Anything, nothing at the moment, right?

740
01:02:44,000 --> 01:03:00,000
Because, like, every, every tech has,
it's, uncertainty at the moment.

741
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,000
All right.

742
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,000
Let's see.

743
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:04,000
We've got a quick thing from Bevis.

744
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:07,000
Is there anything we can do to increase
volume in Ergo?

745
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
They want to sink some of their meme
profits into Ergo, but CEX volumes are

746
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
super low.

747
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Yeah.

748
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:15,000
So read those proposals that I was
talking about.

749
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:21,000
There's some good proposals in Joe's
Treasury proposals that instead of into

750
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:27,000
CEXes, but it pumps it into DEXes, which
offsets that kind of thing.

751
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:31,000
So read those up, push people to pass
them, push the guards to pass them.

752
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
If you know the guards, you do know the
guards because they're posted on the Rosen

753
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
website.

754
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
And push those that you'd like to see
those kind of adoptions if that's what

755
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
you're thinking.

756
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,000
Let's see.

757
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
Why isn't Joe attending AMAs?

758
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,000
He will.

759
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:47,000
He does.

760
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,000
It's early for him.

761
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
Remember, he's in the Midwest.

762
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
So it's very early for him and he's got a
bunch of family things he's working on

763
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
right now.

764
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,000
So yeah, he'll be around.

765
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,000
He's not going anywhere.

766
01:03:54,000 --> 01:04:01,000
Maybe we can do a later one later time.

767
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:08,000
So when it was once I made later time, it
was quite great.

768
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,000
Yeah.

769
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
Let's see.

770
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:14,000
Are you going to token 2049 in Singapore?

771
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
kushti?

772
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,000
Not sure.

773
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:22,000
So I'm thinking actually about attending
Korea, Korean Blockchain Week in

774
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:27,000
September.

775
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Yeah, about token, I'm not sure.

776
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:37,000
It's, it's, quite big conference and so
on, but yeah, I don't know.

777
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:44,000
Probably, the, the, the right connections
already to, work with.

778
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:48,000
And, yeah, that does a big conference,
usually good, about side events to get

779
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:52,000
connections and, that's it.

780
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:56,000
Right.

781
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:59,000
So the conference itself is quite useless
usually.

782
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:00,000
Yeah.

783
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,000
Yeah.

784
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Agreed.

785
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:13,000
I don't know much about the Korean
blockchain world.

786
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:19,000
I've been twice to Seoul.

787
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:26,000
The first time it was Songdo back in 2018
it was some academic conference and then

788
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:33,000
yeah we made ergo presentation in seoul
gangnam around september late september

789
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:40,000
2019 so yeah well after six years it's
definitely worth to visit again and now to

790
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:47,000
well get deeper

791
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:53,000
into what's going on there.

792
01:05:53,000 --> 01:06:04,000
So, well, it seems Korea is always hot
about blockchain.

793
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
All right, we're eight minutes over, but
let's see if we have a killer question

794
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
coming in here.

795
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
This is actually a good question because
I think a lot of people, this is on their

796
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
minds.

797
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:19,000
What happens if Ergo hash rate stays low
while rewards decrease?

798
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:24,000
Is Ergo under threat as a blockchain not
being secured?

799
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:31,000
Didn't we have a decent hash back when
Ergo was 5 cents, 3 cents, 2 cents back in

800
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:38,000
the start?

801
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
It's always going to have an equilibrium
of what the profit is and how many people

802
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
are mining it.

803
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:47,000
Yeah, but it was Autolykos version 1,
right?

804
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:54,000
So you cannot really compare hashes
because well, then there was switch to

805
01:06:54,000 --> 01:07:01,000
version 2, and yeah, well, I don't quite
know even how to compare hashes.

806
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:11,000
But even after the switch, so with
Autolykos version 2, well, as Well,

807
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:21,000
demands to RAM is growing with time.

808
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:24,000
**kushti**:
