1
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Hey guys, welcome to the dev update,
something like number, I've lost count,

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
130.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Tell myself I gotta check.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Well, I'm on the mend, and here we are.
We're landing on vacation, so we've

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
decided to poke our fingers into the
interface a little bit to kind of change

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
the look for the week.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Let's see how it lands, guys.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Very short dev update for you this week.
A lot of stuff always happened in Ergo,

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
but sometimes the devs forget to post to
the weekly dev update chat because they're

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
very busy.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
But that's okay. Fear not, because if you
hang around in the ecosystem, you know

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
that things are bustlin.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:05,000
One thing that was interesting today in
chat that we saw is, you know, community

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:13,000
is a big way to measure crypto, influence
crypto, uptick projects like that.

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
And once in a while, you know, usually
chats have their downtime. Ergo has theirs

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
at about 9 p.m. Eastern Time, which is
like 1 p.m., 1 a.m. UTC.

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Gets a little soft, gets a little quiet.
And so you've got the normal fudsters

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
coming in around that time saying, where's
the community, when community, that kind

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
of thing.

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
And people started posting some things
and they were talking about future

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
finance, other things. People are pushing
sub-blocks and those kind of things.

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
And kushti said something interesting
that was simple and said, you know, we

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
don't need sub-blocks. You know, we have
at the moment, you don't have to wait for

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
sub-blocks. We have many financial tools
for experimentation.

25
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
And he's right. And it makes you think in
these times when, you know, let's not diss

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
other chains, but when a lot of other
chains are based on large money influxes,

27
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
money inflows, and large holders making
ripples in spaces, and then followed by

28
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
meme crazes and things like that.

29
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You know times like these where the
market's down when it's supposed to be

30
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
waiting to go up and those kind of things
in flux, it makes me really happy to be in

31
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Ergo if you take a peek down below me
right here you'll see I don't know what's

32
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
the first 30 or 40 projects that are
active on Ergo that were easy to pluck

33
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
right off the website or sigmaverse.

34
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
We have the meat, you know, we have the
fuel. We have the parts of the recipe for

35
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
anybody to come on and do this stuff and
by looking at the ticket below you can see

36
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
the amazing things that have been
accomplished so far.

37
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,000
So when the market fluctuates, when
CoinGecko makes my portfolio bleed and cry

38
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
a little bit, it doesn't bother me because
I know that I know why we're here. I know

39
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,000
what we've built and I know what we can
build.

40
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
You know, the snap of our fingers with
the tooling that we have. So that always

41
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
brings me a different perspective on that
kind of thing.

42
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
When I see people hurting in other
ecosystems, it sucks for them, I think,

43
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
you know, but Ergo keeps trucking, being
resilient and we keep doing what we're

44
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
doing and people keep catching on.

45
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
So it's an exciting, exciting place to
be, an exciting thing to be in.

46
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
All right, let's hit the dev update real
quick. It's short, as I said, and we won't

47
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
take up too much of your time. We'll hit
the cool change scene button.

48
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Here we go. Ready?

49
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
All right, I hope you enjoyed that change
scene feature. Andy's going to probably

50
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
kill me, but you know, whatever.

51
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
All right, here we go. New format for Dev
Update Display. We've got kushti kicking

52
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
off the chat every Wednesday morning.

53
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I think he's missed it once. And that's
only because I hit it at 8.02 and he came

54
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
in at 8.03 or something like that. So it's
not really a miss.

55
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Alright, first up we have AnonBR with
Team Nautilus. For those of you not

56
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
familiar with Nautilus, it's like a really
good Chrome extension wallet. They're

57
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
working on a mobile version of course, so
stay tuned for that.

58
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
So AnonBR refactored Add Wallet Index
View component, refactored Create Wallet

59
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
View component, refactored Ledger Connect
View component, added Mnemonic component,

60
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
added 24-word mnemonic generation support.

61
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Oh, very nice. Added several minor UI
fixes and code quality improvements. And

62
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,000
you can see a little graphic of some
things that he's done here.

63
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Let's give him all the buttons.

64
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Luivatra claims he's been busy. I think
that's up for debate in the ecosystem. I

65
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
don't know, you know, the European busy is
different than the busy I know about, so

66
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
we're not going to harp on them too much.

67
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
He says, I'm looking forward to trying
out the new execute from VAR function.

68
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Plenty of Paideia contracts could benefit
from that.

69
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
If you haven't tried Paideia, do it. Spin
up a DAO. I mentioned this last week as I

70
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
did. Fantastic app.

71
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
All right, we've got qx() with ErgFi Dexy
Gold swap widget done. Bank LP widget work

72
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
in progress. ErgoPay in progress. Dexy
Gold swap test with fake tokens. End of

73
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
week. Awesome. Thanks, qx().

74
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
kushti is asking how he compiles
contracts. Let's see what else we have.

75
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
We've got kushti with Ergo protocol and
reference client R&D. Client 5.0.25

76
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
released. Recommended update nodes with
extra indices.

77
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Yay, more indexing on your node. Love it.

78
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Sigma SDK 5.0.15 released with Execute
from VAR. That's what Luivatra was excited

79
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
about in BigInt functions to deserialize a
script from context extension variable and

80
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
create BigInt from a script, respectively,
parsing contract template from JSON

81
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
string, box deserialization, W.js, along
with many other features.

82
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
So it looks like they've been busy on
Sigma SDK. That's awesome.

83
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Fixed compatibility issues related with
new sub-blocks per block perimeter

84
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:43,000
injection and with that release 6.0.0 RC2
supporting 6.0 activation in public

85
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:49,000
testnet which as I said last week it's in
and votes are the voting is done to the

86
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:55,000
voting epic so it's live you've got 6.0
running on public testnet.

87
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Anybody want to test that? It's required
for kushti's sub-blocks, which as we know

88
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
are looking forward to be much faster
confirmation times.

89
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
So yeah, that's really cool.

90
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
And here we go for sub-blocks
implementation. Made first test with AI

91
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
for sub-blocks application to fix behavior
of this functionality.

92
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
And working on properly processing
sub-blocks coming out of order with

93
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
delayed transactions, resolving
sub-blocks, forks, etc.

94
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Once you get into speed and you get into
transferring TXs across nodes, it gets a

95
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
little hairy. I mean, that's one of the
reasons that kushti and the other core

96
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
developers settled on two minute block
average times, you know, it's kind of the

97
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
safety net between, you know, too slow,
which Bitcoin essentially, and too fast to

98
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
propagate to the node.

99
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
So every TX, you know, for the finality
of it needs to propagate to all the nodes

100
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
out there for consensus written into a
block.

101
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
But when you have nodes that are delayed
or can't propagate fast enough, you're

102
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
going to possibly run into issues there.
So that's one thing that kushti's figuring

103
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
out with sub-blocks, essentially.

104
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
All right, ChainCash started negative
tests with AI doing new paper, merge PR

105
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
with refund actions and registers. And he
removed this ChainCash pull 10. I'm not

106
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
going to click it, but I'm sure he had
good reason.

107
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Dexy trying to figure out updated mainnet
deployment plan. And I don't know if he

108
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:33,000
mentioned it here. Let's read down below.
He didn't. I think on Thursday. Oh, after

109
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:39,000
the dev update. Yeah, Thursday, the
SigmaUSD Oracle group got together.

110
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
And we pushed a vote to the vote
configuration to the process. And it

111
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
passed, essentially. And everything is
good. Next up is we just have to update

112
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
our clients to version 2.

113
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
And as you've heard people say with Dexy
Gold, the reward token for client runners,

114
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
for server runners, for the protocol is
called GORT. But for SigmaUSD, US dollar

115
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
essentially ERG is going to be called
DORT.

116
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,000
So dollar oracle reward token. I like it.
GORT, DORT. Hopefully we see ORT, like oil

117
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,000
oracle reward token. LORT, lithium oracle
reward token. I don't know, it's endless,

118
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,000
right?

119
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
BORT, banana oracle reward token. I can't
really do a stable card. I mean, you

120
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
could, but you get the idea.

121
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
So you have all these reward tokens that
are possible by running version two of the

122
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
oracle, depending on what you're actually
announcing on chain for a price. So super

123
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
cool with that.

124
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,000
We've got the Rosen Bridge planning to
release Binance in the coming days. We

125
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,000
should see that anytime. We've been
hearing about it in chats. We've got a

126
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
warning in the guard chats about this. So
really, really looking forward to this.

127
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Rosen Bridge watcher version two, add
observation status service in our

128
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
services, write startup and stop functions
in service, add dependency to my service

129
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
like TXPOT, DB service and scanner.

130
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Add function for calls or queries in DB
service. The Rosen Bridge Rosen app.

131
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Implementing the aggregation method for
public event status.

132
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
The RosenSoon, classic.

133
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
All right, let's see. kushti's giving
some advice. There's a suggestion for

134
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Nautilus wallet. Easy to run out of node
with an empty wallet. I want the node to

135
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
be fully automatic without any revision in
computer startup. Getting some ideas for

136
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
that.

137
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Would be nice to have an option to launch
automatically without having to type in

138
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
password. You know, I think there's a way
to do that from all the times that

139
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Nautilus spoken out in support, so that
should be an easy fix, hopefully.

140
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:59,000
All right.

141
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
NodeView XYZ, I spoke about this last
week. It'd be amazing to have a node that

142
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
you could just have a interface on and hop
on. Much easier to install, even if it was

143
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
in the default package.

144
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Added special address and transaction
detection for Spectrum DEX, Rosen Bridge,

145
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
SigmaUSD, and mining pools. Optimized load
times with caching ErgoTree to address

146
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
conversions.

147
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Switch deployment and hosting of NodeView
XYZ for GitHub pages to Cloudflare because

148
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
of HTTPS issues.

149
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Planning to make pop-ups to see
parameters or swaps in cross-chain

150
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
transfers. That's awesome.

151
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
If that's what parameters are swaps and
cross-chain transfers. That means what I

152
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
think it means. Let's see. Cool.

153
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
All right. What else do we have here?

154
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
We have CannonQ giving a little update on
bounties. There's Keystone Wallet

155
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Integration, 3,000 ERG reward, there's
Fleet SDK tutorials, 775 SigmaUSD, and

156
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,000
this week, one bounty cleared, one bounty
added.

157
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
So guys, any of you devs out there,
anybody watching this on YouTube not

158
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
familiar with Ergo or anything, there's a
meat load of bounty updates just ripe for

159
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
the plucking.

160
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Go and update some things. There's
tutorials for Sigma Rust or those kind of

161
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
things depending on what the update
requires. I mean it's just sitting there

162
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
guys. It's literally like money sitting
there for you to grab.

163
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I can't encourage you enough to do this.
Heck even if it takes you two months to

164
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
learn some stuff, just hop on there, learn
it in two months. You'll definitely make

165
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
up your payday from that kind of stuff.

166
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Let's see.

167
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
kushti released Ergo Protocol Reference
Client 5.1.2. They're identical to the

168
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
5.0.25 changes, but on RocksDB.

169
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
So that is a much more stable, I'd say,
database. Less compatible with many

170
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
different architectures, but a little bit
more stable than the current 5.0.25

171
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
database usage.

172
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
If anybody have run nodes, you may have
run into where you've run out of space or

173
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
something happens to your network
connection. It's mainly, I usually only

174
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
run into it when I run out of space on my
hard drive because I'm not paying

175
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
attention on like a little Raspberry Pi.

176
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
You know, that's a funny thing. You run a
node on another chain, right? You probably

177
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
spend a ton of money. You have a massive
hard drive. You probably have monitoring

178
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
tools.

179
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Okay. You run a node on a Raspberry Pi
with like a SD card even if it will run on

180
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:42,000
the fast 10x or 20x ones. And then you
forget it, right?

181
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
And you forget it for too long and you
realize that you run out of space. So it's

182
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
a funny problem that an easy system like
Ergo nodes can run on anything. You still

183
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
got to kind of pay attention once in a
while.

184
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
So anyway, my original point is I would
run out of space, get corrupt databases,

185
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
have to resync. But RocksDB hopefully
should be a little bit better at either

186
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
fixing itself there or not corrupting at
all.

187
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
So that's great.

188
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Oh, and kushti is announcing the good
news that the Oracle operators made the

189
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
update. It was not noticed as the ceremony
took about 20 minutes. And the update

190
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
transaction was right there.

191
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Update is minimal but the script now
allowing for update to oracle version 2

192
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
and I think we're into a couple days here
now so that's it guys thanks for

193
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
listening.

194
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
We've got some things that are always
missed right? I mentioned Cyberverse,

195
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
don't forget to check out Cyberverse. They
had like a game night I think on Thursday

196
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
night UTC time where they played like the
bow and arrow game, they played other

197
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
multiplayer games.

198
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Still a nice high watermark sustaining
through on Cyberverse, they're doing

199
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
great. It's good to see that, those guys
deserve the best.

200
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,000
MewFinance as well, they didn't do an
update this week but check those guys out.

201
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,000
They just supported a liquidity builder or
donation I forget which one it is for the

202
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Sigmanauts mining DAO.

203
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
So it's really nice to be able to do
those kind of launch pads off there to

204
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
raise some funds for shared liquidity.

205
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Sigmanauts Mining DAO is trucking along.
Mark's just upgraded the server to an

206
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
extra hard drive because you can bet that
those logs take up a lot of space when

207
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
you're running something like that with
that much hash.

208
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
So he's doing that. He's diving into his
Sharknet stuff where he's making these

209
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
branded packages based on that theme,
which is really, really cool.

210
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,000
So let me stress, even if you have just
like a 2070 or I don't know, a 3050, a

211
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,000
4050, 4060, 4060, something. But hop into
the mining pool, give it a low enough hash

212
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,000
to where you're not going to be burning
through electricity at this time, and join

213
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,000
the community.

214
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Even if you don't have a card, join the
community. You don't have to be a miner to

215
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
join the Sigmanauts mining DAO,
essentially. I don't think Mark can

216
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
correct me there, but the community is
there and even if you have a small card,

217
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
point it towards a pool and together it'll
make a big difference than any big farm.

218
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
A majority of small users compared to one
big user always makes that big difference.

219
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
So yeah, feel free to dive in there.

220
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I hope you like the new test format. Let
me know in the comments what you think. I

221
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,000
just whipped together a little bit before.
I can add some more fancy stuff.

222
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Maybe make the background a little faster
moving. Maybe make my head less big. I

223
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
don't know if that's possible or not. But
you know, maybe we're shrinkage tools.

224
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Thanks, everybody, for joining. We'll see
you in the AMA on Thursday. And if you're

225
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:58,000
up for it, join the Sigmanauts meeting
later today, later Sunday.

226
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Check in the Sigmanauts chat or ask on
main chat if you can pop in. We're happy

227
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,000
to have people come in and listen since
the text is public anyway.

228
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Ciao, everybody. Bye-bye.
